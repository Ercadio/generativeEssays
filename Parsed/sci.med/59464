From Leon Traister Subject Vitamin B doses Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B I can't seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe limits I looked at a Balanced time release formulation from Walgreen's and noted that the mg of B was some thousands times the RDA Is this safe Also what was the condition that B was theraputic for Mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net Thanks, Leon Traister
