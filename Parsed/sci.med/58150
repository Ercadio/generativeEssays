From Edwin Barkdoll Subject Re Blindsight In article Gordon Banks writes In article John Werner writes In article Gordon Banks wrote I thought there were types of cones equivalent to You're basically right but I think there are just One is sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and This is why the two most common kinds of color blindness are red green and blue Yes I remember that Well in that case the cones are indeed color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had I'm not sure who the original respondent was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just as rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreen in our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not So in sum and to beat a dead horse When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelength the cone outputs are indistinguishable Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods ommatidia or other Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case are processed centrally The handwave is intentional I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect color is But don't take my word for I'm reposting a few excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color vision The texts Robert Boynton Human Color Vision Holt Rhiehart and Winston Leo Hurvich Color Vision Sinauer The original articles Baylor and Hodgkin Detection and resolution of visual stimuli by turtle phoreceptors Baylor Lamb and Yau Reponses of retinal rods to single Schnapf et Visual transduction in cones of the monkey Macaca fascicularis Edwin Barkdoll Edwin Barkdoll
