From Subject RE Robert's Biological Alchemy Robert I'm so glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy I've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts just like I haven't read The Yeast Connection Let me just start by stating that the authors of the Cold Fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile I believe that one has actually left the country Scientific fraud is I'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy Your sources do not seem to be research They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts Robert I try to keep an open But some things I just can't buy one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body Your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above degrees I believe you will get organic residue in the Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at degrees F it may actually be much The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be Chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our Are these fusion reactions Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon Not in my book Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our I've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life I like reading science fiction as many people But I know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in We have several grams of the stuff in our What's it doing there Only the Lord knows right But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans For bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken A vitamin C deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound And so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little But Robert I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers Is the explanation reasonable Without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you don't know any better If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base I'm inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion If the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm going to give isn't going to really mess somebody If this makes us kindred souls Robert then I guess I'll have to live with that For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's interesting post I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on I can't remember the network or his name like many nights I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words He says that he has a success The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment He was going to go in and You guys complain about the cost of the anti What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys I'm going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like Jon and the chronic GI sufferer like Elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments Treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses Is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are How about quality of life guys May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does you may feel differently about the issue Marty
