From Steve Pinn x Subject Re REQUEST Gyro souvlaki sauce Michael Trofimoff wrote Hi All, Would anyone out there in 'net land' happen to have an authentic, sure fire way of making this great sauce that is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki Thanks, I have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow netters about a month ago I am recalling this from memory but I think I'm fairly close by the way it was GREAT pint of plain yogurt med sized cucumber finely shredded cloves of garlic more or less by taste tsp dill weed The yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee filter and allowed to drain at least hours you can adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time up to hours The shredded cuc is drained the same way Mix it all together and let it steep for at least hours it's better the next day and enjoy Steve
