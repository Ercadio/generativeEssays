From Jacquelin Aldridge Subject Re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy G writes Hi I've just returned from a visit with my OB GYN and I have a few concerns that maybe y'all can help me I've been seeing her every weeks for the past few months I'm at week and during the last visits I've gained to pounds every She said this was unacceptable over any week As it stands I've thus far gained Also she says that though I'm at weeks the baby's size is weeks I think she mentioned inches for the top of the When I was weeks the baby's size was I must also add that I had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and I have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended I not walk or move unless I have I have a little handicapped sticker for when I do need to go Anyway that's of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being I told her about this I know this because I wasn't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results' Well now I only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when I was lying on my right It began to get worse though because it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position I was Next I noticed that when I ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got However if I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it wasn't as much of a So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid fatty This makes sense and because I was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have been avoiding these foods on my But I'm still able to eat foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat But doc wants me to be on a non fat This means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin I do this anyway No nuts fried food cheese I am allowed skim She said I should avoid anything sweet bananas Also I must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice She said I can't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or I'm concerned because I understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive And if I'm not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores And why this restriction on carbohydrates if she's concerned about fat I'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which I can't seem to find any information She originally said that I should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since I was about lbs overweight when I But my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she's taken it all off and hasn't had any She also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe She did want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be temporary for that one What I want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet I would understand if she had said low fat diet since I'm trying that anyway even if she said really low fat I think she assumes I must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to use the energy from the food I do Any opinions info and experiences will be I'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and I'll end up having to eat Thus far I don't find any foods Thanks G For one week she probably wants to see how you react to the If it changes You can live on the diet but you need to up your Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked Smaller meals but more of Not terrific amounts of meat it's hard to digest For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach Is the baby still coming Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs How tight are your You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive Try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being Easier on your legs circulation as You might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this Especially if she's But this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if Nausea can vary from person to person and with each My first pregnancy was During the second I had very little Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their grain of salt here Good luck Jackie
