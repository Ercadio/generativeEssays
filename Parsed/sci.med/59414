From Christopher Henrich Subject Re Krillean Photography In article Story writes In article carl writes Greg Flame definitely intended Bill was making fun of the Go look up the word Also the correct spelling is It involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the subject to a high voltage source not of some It works equally well with inanimate but what about showing the missing part of a leaf Is this corona discharge I think I can explain the missing part of a leaf I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian photograph in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of Kirlian That particular photograph That's right the effect has been observed only Even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian For his next experiment he cut the leaf in half put one half down between the same two plates and took another The missing half effect was created by water oils left behind after the first This explanation must be tentative because after all I wasn't there when it Regards Chris Henrich
