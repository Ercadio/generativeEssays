From nigel allen Subject New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes Results to Be Reported To National Desk Health Writer Contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber or for the Huntington Medical Research LOS ANGELES April A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes HMRI in Pasadena Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging MRI called magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS a research team led by Brian Ross conducted a study on elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination PROBE reduces the examination time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than By comparison the current standard of care in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by In addition to Alzheimer's disease the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including AIDS related dementia Parkinson's disease and Huntington's We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software said Ross adding this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols and myo inositol MI acted as a marker in the In comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a percent increase in MI while their level of another chemical called N acetylaspartate NAA was significantly lower indicating a loss of brain stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be This is attributable Ross believes to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve This belief has been adhered to over the last years and consequently most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this For this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine said Bruce Miller a noted neurologist at Harbor UCLA MRS researcher and a co author of the Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex Moats Truda Shonk Thomas Ernst and Suzanne Woolley The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units For

disease and how is it caused Alzheimer's disease AD is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in by the German neuropathologist Alois As the disease progresses it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality loss of control of bodily functions and eventually How many people does it affect Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death taking approximately lives each While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both emotionally and financially for patients' AD is the most common cause of dementia in Symptoms worsen every year and death usually occurs within years of initial What are its signs and symptoms Although the cause of AD is not known two risk factors have been identified advanced age and genetic The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach percent by the age of In patients with familial AD immediate family relatives have a percent chance of developing One of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness caused by short term memory Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and suggests the following criteria Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is Forgetting the name of a loved one is Forgetting where you left your keys is Forgetting how to get home is Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of Canada Remote Systems Toronto Ontario
