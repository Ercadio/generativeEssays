From michael a vincze Subject Re Chromium for weight loss In article U writes There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight The few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher ently biased the investigators were making money from marketing it Theoretically it really doesnt make sense The claim is that chromium will increase muscle mass and decrease Of course chromium is also used t o cure diabetes high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes just as well as anabolic steroids Sounds like snake oil for the 's Where are your references I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium cures diabetese It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to High blood pressure I have never heard of this claim anabolic steroids I have also never heard of this claim Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what Did somebody piss you off at one time On the other hand it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet and place bo effects of anything can be pretty I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long term weight control and make an important contribution to good It is important to exercise and also avoid fat calories Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle I will not bore you with the You wouldn't believe these Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral Chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body's tissues to the hormone Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles This protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ By sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less Preservation of lean body mass has an important long term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they've Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic heat producing effects of Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases In summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than of Eating fat makes you Increase dietary fiber low in calories high in Get regular aerobic exercise at least times a week burn Take chromium picolinate daily lose fat keep muscle References Kaats GR Fisher JA Blum Abstract American Aging Association Annual Meeting Denver October Evans Int J Biosoc Med Res Page TG Ward TL Southern J Animal Sci Suppl Abstract Felig Clin Physiol Kimball SR Jefferson Diabetes Metab Rev Fukugawa NK Minaher KL Rowe et J Clin Invest Fehlmann M Freychet Biol Chem Pittman CS Suda AK Chambers JB Ray Metabolism Danforth E Am J Clin Nutr McCarty Med Hypoth Bielinski R Schutz Y Jequier Am J Clin Nutr Young JC Treadway JL Balon TW Garvas HP Ruderman Metabolism Best regards Michael Vincze
