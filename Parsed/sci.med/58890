From Jeff Parke Subject Re Lyme vaccine kathleen richards kilty ucrengr wrote My nearly year old Pomeranian had a nasty reaction to this Suffice it to say we will not vaccinate her for Lyme disease She's been camping through some states and has backpacked with us as well and we are used to watching for ticks and dealing with them and we simply won't take her to really active Lyme disease Not to drag this out anymore Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness swollen joints A recent paper March has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly This has been an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular Up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that the disease This paper is noteworthy in two other regards None of the animals they infected were treated in any The dogs had episodes of lameness during a week period which occurred months after After this period none showed any further clinical signs up to the month observation period of the So these are proven clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug Of course observations longer than months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the Of course they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine Anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or Jeff Parke also jeffp AOL JeffParke Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of Pullman WA
