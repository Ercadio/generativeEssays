conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on Tuesday July Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer Scientists Mick Noordewier Rutgers University This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex Material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Biologists Richard Lathrop MIT Arris An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological Fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial Lathrop co developer of ARIADNE and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and Neural Networks Statistics and Information Theory in Biological Sequence Analysis Alan Lapedes Los Alamos National Laboratory This tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence Closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence Lapedes of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming John Koza Stanford University The genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological This tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the Genetic Programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be Particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the Koza a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis David Searls University of Pennsylvania Shmuel Pietrokovski Weizmann Institute Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional Searls who holds research faculty appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while Shmuel Pietrokovski has studied and published with Edward Trifinov
