From Joel Broude Subject Mevicore vs Lopid vs I used to be on lopid It did a good job of reducing cholesterol down to around , as well as LDL and triglycerides Then, I got pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well cholesterol and triglycerides soared The levels might have stabilized over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch to Mevicore On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to , LDL was , and HDL was but the trig's were still very high, around , and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, SGOT N , GGTP hard to read copy N He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal Just to be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem , and wants me to go back on it after that I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of Should the above liver and trig figures be feared What happens to folks with high trig levels Is my liver in danger with the above results Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug Niacin affected my liver, too
