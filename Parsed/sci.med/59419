From Joel Broude Subject Mevicore Lopid I used to be on It did a good job of reducing cholesterol down to around as well as LDL and Then I got pneumonia and for some reason the Lopid stopped working very well cholesterol and triglycerides The levels might have stabilized over time but a new doctor had me quit wait a month then switch to On Mevicore my total cholesterol was down to LDL was and HDL was but the trig's were still very high around and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal SGOT N GGTP hard to read copy N He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal Just to be extra cautious though I'm sure it's not a and wants me to go back on it after I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond Should the above liver and trig figures be feared What happens to folks with high trig levels Is my liver in danger with the above results Would I be better off on Lopid despite its inconvenient side effect or perhaps some other drug Niacin affected my liver too
