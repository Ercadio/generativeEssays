From carl brenner Subject Re Update Help was What is This Is it Lyme's In article Gordon Banks writes In article carl brenner writes see the ulterior motive It is easy for me to see it the those physicians who call everything lyme and treat There is a lot of money You keep bringing this But I don't understand what's in it financially for the physician to go ahead and Unless the physician has an investment in or is involved in some kickback scheme with the home infusion company where is the financial gain for the doctor Well let me put it this way based on my own A general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases by establishing links to the Lyme community treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as MS are probably spirochetal if not Lyme giving talks at meetings of users groups validating the feelings of even delusional patients This GP can go from being a run of the mill yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office and making lots of Also getting the adulation of many who believe his is their only hope if not of cure then of control and seeing his name in publications put out by support groups This is a definite Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire I can't really argue with your logic though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme By your logic I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money rather than because they believe they are encouraging good I have no idea how sincere these guys are but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues in Lyme rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties Gordon Banks Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and it is shameful to surrender it too Carl Brenner
