From Mark Fulk Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy tradition In article Gary Merrill writes In article Mark Fulk writes What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use unless they make you do some I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU He got very excited hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding The result was a well conserved or so bp sequence that occurs about times in the human Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was Other species have different sets of Fortunately for me Warren and I used to eat dinner at Fridays all the It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of I'm not sure that it's But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting If you are really working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstances the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you If they are wrong you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out something If you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all in mind you will probably get Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a Unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non rational Then we get varieties of pathological science Lysenko Mirsky's opposition to DNA as gene cold fusion and so If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning This is what leads one ala Feyerabend to an anything goes I don't agree that this In fact this is exactly the point at which I disagree with It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing Failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work Another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental design'' I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental choice not Alexander Fleming Royal chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea Fleming probably thought runny bottom runny nose what the hell it's worth a but his method of looking for phage was well designed to detect anything phage like in fact he found True the generation part can be totally But typically it is not Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of It is not clear to me what you mean by rational Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical The main examples I can think of are from modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a Mark Fulk University of Rochester Computer Science Department
