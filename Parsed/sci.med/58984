From OPIRG Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article Steve Dyer writes In article OPIRG writes There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people That's the point after Why don't you just look it up in the Merk Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread That's because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people they're looking at animal You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in This is precisely NOT what you Among others see Olney's Excitotoxic Food Aditives Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety vol I'm sure PETA would love to hear your Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra The Glu and Asp were administered Some studies used IV and Intra ventricular is not a normal method for food studies for obvious You must not have read the peer reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection It most certainly is for You know studies of glutamate involve more than food science Whose talking about food science What is this comment supposed to mean Neurotoxicology and Tratology Brain Research Nature Progress in Brain Research all fine food science Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the journals Have you done a thorough literature search So point us to the studies in humans I'm familiar with the literature and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on Then you would know that Olney himself has casually referred to Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in a few Why don't you point us to some studies Maybe then this exchange could be The point is exceeding the Of course they're amino Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine it's a essential amino They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the They're unable to metabolise Olney's research compared infant human Specifically the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed Mother's milk was well below the effective Goodness I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented It's just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you're misrepresenting it as received Who said anything about 'received wisdom' There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate Humans are Now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary ANH and ME of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this It's unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in The food industry knows That's why the animal model is used in medicine and If you're talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and I suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities You and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of Glu and Asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in HVP necessitates extreme Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults The main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects You mean asserting You're being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some Terry Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into Could this be the cause of headaches I don't Why am I not surprised Dianne Murray Probably one of the dumber remarks you've If you had read Olney's review article especially the remarks I already quoted in an earlier post you would know to what I was May I ask exactly for whom you do computer consulting
