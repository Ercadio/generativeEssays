From Jim Zisfein Subject Data of skull GT From Gary Taylor GT Hi, We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull You could do high resolution CT computed tomographic scanning of the skull Many CT scanners have an algorithm to do D reconstructions in any plane you want If you did reconstructions every degrees or so in all planes, you could use the resultant images to create user controlled animation SLMR E mail Jim Zisfein
