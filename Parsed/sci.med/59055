Subject Broken rib From Hello I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this question however Here I I am a commercial fisherman and I fell about weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left My question I have been to a doctor and was told that it was best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect and indeed I am about better however the work I do is very hard and I am still not able to go back to The thing that worries me is the movement or clunking I feel and hear back there when I move certain I heard some one talking about the rib they broke years ago and that it still bothers any opinions thanx and cheers John Cross The Old Frog's Almanac Home of The Almanac UNIX Users Group Public Access UseNet Vancouver Island British Columbia Waffle XENIX
