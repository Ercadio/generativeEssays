Page Volume Number April The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start treating HIV positive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show HIV is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID said We must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial He said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of Fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in Nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors Cecil Fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of HIV infected AIDS activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph We've known about this for five years but we're glad it is now in the public domain said Jesse Dobson of the California based Project But

of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal Washington Post The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health care professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association JAMA This finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting HIV from a health care worker is Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two HIV positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the The studies were conducted by separate research teams in New Hampshire Maryland and Each study started with an HIV positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to The New Hampshire study found that none of the patients who had undergone invasive

School of Public Health in Atlanta Berkley's editorial on why American doctors should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large Berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the AIDS epidemic in its first But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and HIV AIDS in Vice President Al Gore proposes in his book Earth in

cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York in reply to a letter by Gellert and Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting Berkley disagrees with the contention that AIDS is receiving too much HIV differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to For most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and But with AIDS and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much Interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts Berkley says he agrees with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political But he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership

Trial Begins In HIV Infected Children The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the virus that causes The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in children recruited from at least sites Volunteers must be HIV infected but have no symptoms of HIV HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV infected children who now face the certainty they will develop Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet If these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates children in the United States have By the end of the decade the World Health Organization projects million children will be infected The study will enroll children ages month to years NIAID which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April stimulate new It will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the The results from the pediatric trial known as ACTG will be examined closely for other reasons as This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines said Daniel Hoth director of NIAID's division of We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in In the United States most HIV infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or Nearly all HIV infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in The most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS related infection by to years of These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital At least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older All volunteers must have well documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or They cannot have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the Study chair John Lambert of the University of Rochester Medical School and co chair Samuel Katz of Duke University School of Medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said We'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV

Page Volume Number April NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY News from the National Institute of Dental Research There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the National Institues of They report that HIV itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for Although the HIV genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals' immunity the researchers This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research NIDR Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the To bypass this problem scientists have developed HIV transgenic mice which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in Those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in In the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV which allowed the animals to live Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and Other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in No skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic Studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the HIV genetic HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said The scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions Kopp Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Peter Dickie who is now

S N E W S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES March HHS Secretary Donna Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or The toll free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a It provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Secretary Shalala said One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support Currently many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more Secretary Shalala said This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily The telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from to EST to PST Monday through During these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an At other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care including the latest HIV AIDS drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or When a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV related The consultant asks for patient specific information including cell count current medications sex age and the patient's HIV This national service has grown out of a month local effort that
