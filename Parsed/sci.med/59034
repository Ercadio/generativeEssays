From Jon Noring Subject Good Grief was Re Candida Albicans what is it In article David Rind writes In article David Partain writes Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans a disease about which I can find no Apparently it has something to do with the body's production of yeast while at the same time being highly allergic to Can anyone out there tell me any more about it Candida albicans can cause severe life threatening infections usually in people who are otherwise quite This is not however the sort of illness that you are probably Systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream There is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness There is no convincing evidence that such a disease There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is For example Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as Nizoral to his new patients IF they've been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two He's kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus Of course this is only the beginning for his In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' I agree it is a poorly written book extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors which I never had before started in November Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two I'm also greatly improved in other areas as Of course I have allergy symptoms I am especially allergic to molds yeasts It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic Of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not One almost has to take an empirical approach to Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical BTW some would say to try Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee their For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am Jon Noring Charter Member INFJ If you're dying to know what INFJ means be brave e mail me I'll send Jon Noring JKN International IP FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE Carlton Place Phone CHIPS World's Best Livermore CA V Mail Who are you Read That's where the action
