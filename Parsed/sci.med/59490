From Subject Re Kidney Stones In article ron roth writes Marty Banschbach writes B Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this There B has always been the use of conventional A very good example is B kidney Conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been B done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the B intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones B from Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to B breakdown the stone once it Through the recent New England J of B Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong B increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is B restricting calcium B Marty Marty I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article on kidney stones as First of all I would want to know who sponsored that I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers magazines to TV guide with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition The study didn't say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large ly Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain It wouldn't be the first Sodium magnesium calcium phosphorus ratios are in my opinion still the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention of kidney I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS raising approach instead Ron Roth Ron you are absolutely Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium But the vast majority are calcium Calcium is just one piece of the I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine always has been and probably always will If one uses conventional wisdom there is a chance that you will be As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage what's the big deal why call a physician who gives anti fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack On the kidney stone I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful I agree If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with Marty
