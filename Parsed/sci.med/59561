From Dov Bai MSI Visitor Subject Re Earwax In article Joel B Levin writes bobm Bob McQueer writes One question I do have a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining trapped water said he told swimmers to do this after swimming It works but it stings like the devil so I've always been content to let any water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the Any comments Perhaps diluting the rubbing alcohol in some water until you feels comfortable will do the trick
