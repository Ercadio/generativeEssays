From David Rind Subject Re Candida yeast Bloom Fact or Fiction In article writes are in a different The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics I guess I'm still not clear on what the term candida bloom means but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosis that has been being found in the sinus mucus membranes than is Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti fungal Lucky how Since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis I've mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating ounces of yogurt It turns out most would rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast yogurt dangerous If this were a standard part of medical practice as Gordon says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should Again this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea but I don't think anyone would view this as a quack David Rind
