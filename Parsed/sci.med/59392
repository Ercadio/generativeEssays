From jhsu Jeffrey Hsu Subject Re Med school admission I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much I applied to about schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to hear from the other Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions Numbers GPA MCATs are not everything but they are probably more important than anything In fact some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other Of course when this happens don't expect a refund on your application But the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified You mentioned one response was it an acceptance denial or wait list If I assume the worst that it was a denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance How did your interviews go As for how long you have to wait I've called a few schools who never contacted me for Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now I can assume a Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as But some schools are still I really don't think you should Don't become fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of What do people think of the medical school admissions process I had a very mediocre GPA but high MCAT scores and I have been working as a software engineer for two I majored in Computer Science at Still I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this VERY IMPORTANT GPA or better MCAT top in all subject MEDIUM IMPORTANCE Writing Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities LESS IMPORTANT College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know Anyway you are in good I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each person as an Sometimes thats just not But getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the Hopefully you were able to impress them with your Good luck Jeff
