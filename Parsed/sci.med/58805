From Chris Black Subject cystic breast disease My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease a big relief as it was a lump that could have been Her doctor says she should go off caffeine and chocolate for months as well as stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause related She's not thrilled with this I think especially because she just gave up cigarettes soon she won't have any pleasures left Now I thought I'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health Is this accurate If so why is she being told to make various sacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a deal Thanks for any Chris Note My mailer tends to garble subject
