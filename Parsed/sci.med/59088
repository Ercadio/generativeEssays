From Bill Claussen Subject RE just posted this on as a response to what the group is A note to the users of This group was originally a takeoff from The reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive as antidepressents tri cyclics Prozac Lithium etc antipsychotics Melleral sp etc OCD drugs Anafranil etc and so on and so It didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo That's to bad for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive It was also to discuss real life experiences and side effects of the above Oh well I had unsubscribed to this group for some time and I decided to check it today to see if anything had old nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it being Oh well obviously no one really Bill Claussen Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group Bill Claussen
