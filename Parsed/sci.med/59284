Administration FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera an injectable contraceptive The drug which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent It is more than percent This drug presents another long term effective option for women to prevent pregnancy said FDA Commissioner David Kessler As an injectable given once every three months Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily Depo Provera is available in single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive If a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the As with any such products FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the World Health Organization and health agencies in other clinical trials begun in also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight In addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume

been approved for contraception in many other The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo which will market the drug under the name Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection first submitted it for approval in the United States in the At that time animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer including breast cancer in humans to be minimal if HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life Threatening Illnesses Food and Drug Administration Monica Revelle The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life threatening illnesses such as AIDS cancer and Alzheimer's These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical One new drug zalcitabine also called ddC was approved June using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the cause of Accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when FDA determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight said FDA commissioner David Kessler While drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Articles Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing Blindness due to Retinal Disease National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests Baltimore MD Researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ REGN have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the The degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment This research published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science PNAS holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration It is estimated that million Americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes In addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal The research was funded in part by the RP Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye It was conducted by Matthew LaVail Kazuhiko Unoki Douglas Yasurnura Michael Matthes and Roy Steinberg at UCSF arld C eorge Yancoooulos Regeneron's Vice President for Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from In the research described in the PNAS a light damage model was used to assess the survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor BDNF and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor CNTF were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor NGF and Insulin like Growth Factor IGF were not effective in these Discussing the research Jesse Cedarbaum Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research said BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment and for retinal Following detachment permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April result frorn the death of detached retinal It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells

Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written by Mary Weideman Nov Dec National Institutes of Health High fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in These findings according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator William Connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences Over the past years Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid These native Mexicans number approximately and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance Probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their Loosely translated the name Tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and Their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable Dietician Martha McMurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dL low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol levels of mg dl and high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol levels of to mg All of those values are in the good low risk range according to the Elevated cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April HDL cholesterol is considered In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators' direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein Regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold Thirteen Tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or CSI recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the LDL Connor The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of Connor's affluent diet used in the study ranks a CSI of The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of Changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental The Framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in All subjects were already eating on a plateau Connor After weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the LDL fraction which rose HDL cholesterol increased by per cent and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very Plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in According to Connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized We think HDL cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native In the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study Connor Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a CSI around varying in accordance with caloric Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a Mediterranean style The original Mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the The World Health Organization WHO is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite who typically eat a different diet than the average If the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology Connors The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is percent less than it was years ago so a lot has been We are changing rapidly he
