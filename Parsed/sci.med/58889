From Michael Holloway Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy tradition In article Mark Fulk writes In article Gary Merrill writes In article Mark Fulk writes What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren't of any use unless they make you do some I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual day to day of the grunt at the Yes its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it as long as my advisor doesn't catch me which is easy enough to do but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in In today's world that's what determines what science is what gets And a damn good thing Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything at least not in biomedical The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some MD's seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU He got very excited hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding The result was a well conserved or so bp sequence that occurs about times in the human Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was Other species have different sets of Fortunately for me Warren and I used to eat dinner at Fridays all the I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to I've read alot of the Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting good work with implications for many fields in molecular It's really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting results that were Mike
