From David Scheim Subject Re Burzynski's Antineoplastons In article Josh Schwimmer writes I've recently listened to a tape by Stanislaw Burzynski in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti cancer properties that he names Burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the United States despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical What is the generally accepted opinion of Burzynski's research He paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment but I have no basis from which to judge his Two weeks ago however I read that the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a treatment that didn't seem Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be Joshua Schwimmer There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father to undertake his treatment for brain This disease is universally and usually rapidly After diagnosis in June the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and The forum member checked extensively on Burzynki's track record for this He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and After the forum member's father began Burzynski's treatment in September all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or The patient's oncologist although telling him he would probably not live past December was vehemently opposed to his trying Burzynski's Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Burzynski's treatment she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments saying if it ain't broke don't fix Burzynski is an with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients synthesized it and administers it to patients with certain cancer There is little understanding of the actual mechanism of David Scheim BITNET none INTERNET PHONE CompuServe FAX DISCLAIMER These comments are offered to share knowledge based upon my personal They do not represent the positions of my
