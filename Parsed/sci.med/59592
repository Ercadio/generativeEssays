From Mark Robert Thorson Subject Re INFO Colonics and Purification Not everything that goes in comes out and personaly I don't mind giving my body a hand once in a Just my experience George Paap I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery and on the topic of massage this is a recurring Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better especially if they have muscular or joint But like chiropracty there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their In the case of massage there is a technique called deep abdominal massage in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies releasing poisons which cause various disease By this vigorous and painful procedure it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it The human intestine is not a New York City sewer pipe And even if it were you eat half of a small box of Triscuits and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the inner surface of your intestine
