LINKED TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS American Lung Association A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for The Seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality People with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said Joel Schwartz of the Environmental Protection Agency who was the lead author of the When people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the The Seattle Study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or These finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of In Seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as The authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the four day average of the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease an official journal of the American Thoracic Society the Lung Association's medical The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health A study by Schwartz and Douglas Dockery of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the United Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as One problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and HICNet Medical Newsletter

Consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the Seattle Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the standard any time Until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne In some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that's rarely particulate matter says However doesn't have to be near

Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma the appropriate diagnosis management and followup of patients with early melanoma the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance and the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and Following days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus Among their findings the panel recommended that melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with centimeter margins thin invasive melanoma less than millimeter thick has the potential for long term survival in more than percent of patients after surgical excision with a centimeter margin elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from A copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by calling the NIH Office of Medical Applications

Designated Cancer Centers The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of NCI designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and Within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control Although some cancer centers existed in the late and the it was the National Cancer Act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing The passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control Over the next two decades the centers' program grew In there were comprehensive cancer centers in the Today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer Under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical Moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant also referred to as a or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center's These criteria encompass strong participation in NCI designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Of the NCI designated Cancer Centers are of the basic science These centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the Clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research There are such centers Finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control These centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical Together the NCI Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical Comprehensive Cancer Centers Internet addresses are given where available University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center Basic Health

multiple AIDS vaccines instead of only allowing the Army to test a single vaccine administration sources said The decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by MicroGeneSys and the National Institutes of Health which contended that multiple vaccines should be Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last Companies including Genentech Chiron and Immuno AG have already told NIH that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine The testing is intended to demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already Shalala refuted last week's reports that the Clinton administration had decided the Army's test of the MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same The report was inaccurate and I expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular AIDS research project said Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced the White House that multiple vaccines should be tested But MicroGeneSys president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two HICNet Medical Newsletter

demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing AIDS within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years The Lancet published preliminary findings of the three year study which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug's cost side effects and general Even though researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than American trials many argue the European
