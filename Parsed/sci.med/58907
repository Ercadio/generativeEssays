From Steve Dyer Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article OPIRG writes Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people That's the point after Like youself Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition Have you read Olney's work I fail to see how citing results from peer reviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked That's because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people they're looking at animal You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in This is precisely NOT what you Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra The Glu and Asp were administered Some studies used IV and Intra ventricular is not a normal method for food studies for obvious You must not have read the peer reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection It most certainly is for You know studies of glutamate involve more than food science Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the journals Have you done a thorough literature search So point us to the studies in humans I'm familiar with the literature and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on The point is exceeding the Of course they're amino Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine it's a essential amino They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the Olney's research compared infant human Specifically the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed Mother's milk was well below the effective Goodness I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented It's just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you're misrepresenting it as received Read Olney's review paper in Brain Res and check his They are There is no There most certainly is a Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects You mean asserting You're being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the Why am I not surprised Dianne Murray Probably one of the dumber remarks you've Steve Dyer aka ima harvard rayssd linus spdcc dyer
