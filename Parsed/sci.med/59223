From Alice Sanders Subject Frozen shoulder and lawn mowing Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a It is still partially frozen and I am still in physical therapy every But the pain has subsided almost UNTIL last week when I mowed the lawn for twenty minutes each two days in a I have a push type power The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite a while and I used ice and medicine Can anybody explain why this particular activity which does not seem to stress me very much generally should cause this shoulder problem Alice
