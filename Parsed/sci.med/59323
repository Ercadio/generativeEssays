From Subject PMS Can It Be Prevented By A Diet Change This question came up in Nutrition and I'm posting my answer Only medical schools in the teach courses on human We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical I think that the best example of where medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is So many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever Before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is From A Poster In Nutrition In a psychological anthropology course I am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about Some rumors shared by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar intake and caffeine intake might affect PMS Is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey Many thanks Michael I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side tracked with PMS is a lot like Candida blooms most physicians don't recognize it as a specific disease Here is everything that you would ever want to know about Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups PMT A Anxiety PMT D depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy PMT C Craving PMT H Hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness headache edema of the face and extremities palpitations fatigue or fainting PMT A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's PMT C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple During the luteal phase of a women's cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and seem to be specific to PMS Psychiatry Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increased to of the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic PMT D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's Another cause of PMT D has been found to be lead toxicity in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol PMT H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone Salt restriction magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes Rational for a nutritional approach A Year in Nutritional Bland Keats Publishing Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes Premenstrual tension Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms While progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS much more than candida blooms Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done Here are a few of these studies CARBOHYDRATE Experimental Controlled Study Effect of a low fat high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy Lancet pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no After months there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling tenderness and VITAMIN A Experimental Controlled Study The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension Acta Gynecol pts with severe recurring PMS received to vitamin A daily or a Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured serum retinol above ml The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size to and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of Only getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS Experimental Controlled Study Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A Clinical Endocrinology pts received of vitamin A daily starting on day of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS After months all pts reported a significant improvement in PMS Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate Of all the vitamins given for PMS vitamin A and vitamin E vitamin A has shown the best single This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A VITAMIN Experimental Double blind Crossoverr Study Pyridoxine vitamin and the premenstrual syndrome A randomized crossover trial women aged with moderate to severe PMS randomly received daily or After months the groups were switched and followed for another had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS depression irritability and tiredness Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by Experimental Double blind Study The efects of vitamin supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms Gynecol pts with moderate to severe PMS received daily or placebo for Analysis of convergence showed that significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system dizziness and vomiting as well as behavior changes poor mental performance decreased social interaction Anxiety depression and water retention were not improved by Vitamin is below the RDA for both American men and Birth control pills and over different drugs increase the requirement in Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with mg of per The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS David Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Psychiatry News December as stating that should be considered the first line drug for PMS over progesterone and if the patient does not respond then other treatments should be Vitamin can be toxic nerve damage if consumed in doses of or more each VITAMIN E Experimental Double blind Study Efficacy of alpha tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome pts received vitamin E daily for cycles or a Vitamin E treated pts had who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms weight gain and breast tenderness while the placebo group had who reported a significant reduction in physical The vitamin E group reported that had a significant reduction in anxiety versus for the placebo For depression the vitamin E group had with a significant decrease in depression compared with for the placebo Experimental Double blind Study The effect of alpha tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy A double blind study with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at or daily or After months of supplementation of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT A and PMT The dose was needed to significantly improve PMT No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT H other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT H symptoms MAGNESIUM Experimental Double blind Study Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine effects on itracellular magnesium Headache pts with perimenstrual headache received mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a Treatment was started on the day of the cycle and continued until After months the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire Pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of pts compared to control women who did not suffer from After treatment magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal Experimental Double blind Study Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes Gynecol aged randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid of Mg per day or a placebo from the day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual After cycles both groups received The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium In addition the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in to be anecdotal in nature I have not bothered to cite There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri pellagra scruvy PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the should get a good course on human PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin mineral supplementation and or diet change in preventing Experimental Study Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysis were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite R plus additional vitamin C vitamin E magnesium zinc and primrose The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate On a retrospective analysis of the reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from Experimental Double blind Study Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes J A low fat high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and After months on the experimental program the vitamin mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their Experimental Double blind Study Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome randomly given Optivite tablets per day or a The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the Another group of got Optivite tablets per day or For this second group of patients no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was Martin Banschbach Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman Department of Biochemistry
