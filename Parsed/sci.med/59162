From Brandon Brylawski Subject Re Should I be angry at this doctor writes Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor Last Saturday evening my year old son cut his finger badly with a I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at The clinic was open till The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at and did not want to be delayed During the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me the doctor was doing paperwork in the back the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room the doctor would not even speak to me she would not tell me the doctor's name or her own name when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said I don't I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be My son did get three stitches at the emergency Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center the above behavior is completely If a patient who requires extensive care shows up at the last minute we always see them and give them appropriate It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours but what you describe is Ask to speak to the clinic director and Whatever their attitude they have nothing to gain from angering Brandon Brylawski
