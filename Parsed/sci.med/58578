with this sort of Generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of DON'T WAIT GO SEE A The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour Occupational Safety and Health Service Occupational Overuse Treatment and Rehabilitation A Practitioner's Guide First a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands note you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors RSI Repetitive Strain Injury a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS Occupational Overuse Syndrome synonym for RSI CTD Cumulative Trauma Disorder another synonym for RSI WRULD Work Related Upper Limb Disorders yet another synonym for RSI CTS Carpal Tunnel Syndrome see below Hyperextension Marked bending at a Pronation Turning the palm Wrist extension Bending the wrist Supination Turning the palm Wrist flexion Bending the wrist Pinch grip The grip used

out Now then problems come in two main types Local conditions and diffuse Local problems are what you'd expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves being inflamed or otherwise Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they're not necessarily the Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur Here's the Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle When you tense a muscle you restrict the blood By the time you're exerting of your full power you're completely restricting your blood Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive More tension means less blood flow and the cycle Another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your They need blood Anyway when you're typing too much you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood Stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things Specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and Acute injuries are severely painful and Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as Tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you've got your Tendonitis an inflammation of a Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more Sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive Carpal Tunnel Syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around Symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of CTS is often confused for a diffuse Adverse Mechanical Tension also known as 'neural tension' this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy Others for just about every part of your body there's a fancy name for a way to injure By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and Just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and This requires learning how to If you're under a load of stress this is doubly Tune out the world and breath deep and Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND Really do it every three It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and If you can't sleep you really need to focus on Rest sleep and relaxation are really a big There are all kinds of other treatments of Drugs can reduce inflamation and Custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad Surgery can fix some Exercise can help strengthen your Regular stretching can help prevent Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced Ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce Only your doctor can say what's best for Posture here are some basic I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix dwallach Let your shoulders Let your elbows swing Keep your wrists Pull your chin in to look down don't flop your head Keep the hollow in the base of your Try leaning back in the Don't slouch or slump Alter your posture from time to Every minutes get up and bend your spine Set the seat height Your feet should be flat on the There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work If you are short this may be The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if Now I diverge a little from the text A good chair makes a big If you don't like your chair go find a better You really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat Most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the You should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that's right for In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just The name says it Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this For some people wrist pads seem to work However with good posture you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about Of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all Wrist pads may or may not help at You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly A number of replacements are available on the market Check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much Requests for more info
