From Bill Christens Barry Subject cytoskeleton dynamics I'm looking for good background and review paper references that can help me understand the dynamics of cytoskeleton in normal and transformed In particular I'm not interested in translational behavior and cell motility but rather in the internal motions of the cytoskeleton and its components under normal and transformed Also I'd appreciate any data on force constants mechanical and elastic properties of microtubules and viscous properties of Any other info relevant to the vibrational or acoustical properties of these would be useful to Bill Christens Barry
