From johnf John Finlayson Subject Re Exercise and Migraine In article ntmtv Janet Jakstys writes the other day I played tennis during my lunch I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense I got overheated and Afterwards I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about hours later I could feel a migraine I continued to drink water in the I took cafergot but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about that night the pain This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into shape and don't play at high noon to prevent this Hi Janet Sounds exactly like Same circumstance same onset symptoms same cafergot uselessness same In fact of all the people I know who have migraines none have been so There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my I don't think it's heat per se I've had more in winter than summer Dehydration could conceivably figure Try tanking up before playing rather than Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much I've identified four factors that do make a difference listed in descending order of importance Heavy exercise Sleep deprivation Fasting skipped breakfast Physical trauma head bonk Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post adolescent migraines but I don't get migraines after every heavy exercise One or more of the other factors must be present usually Since I discovered this I've been nearly migraine free relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky It's been so long maybe I just don't get them anymore and stop being Hope this is
