From Lawrence Curcio Subject Re Use of haldol in elderly I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital In the examples I've seen drugs were definitely My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the He was fifty three at the time and he was on separate The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs They even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well With the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication He had a seizure that night and was put back on one Two days later he was his old self I guess there aren't many medical texts that address the subject of way I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical It is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to Docs seem to believe that because they have close control of you it's quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own That control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care providers can make mistakes too and mistakes can be deadly under those I grant you that sometimes there's no Nevertheless I suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss it with an independent Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL at HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused Just my opinion Larry obviously not a doc
