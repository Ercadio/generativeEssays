From Dan Hartung Subject The Andromeda Strain Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A E some years since I saw it I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances Clearly they faked a lot of the computer robotic technology certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself let alone the idea of a space germ Quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again I watched a segment on the otherwise awful How'd They Do That dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps And the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the I'm curious what people think about this film short of silly Is such a facility technically feasible today As far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not Life As We Know It that's a whole 'nother argument for or Next a Waco update an Ohio prison update a Bosnia update a Russian update an abortion update and a Congressional update here on SNN The Standoff News All news all standoff all day Daniel Hartung Ask me about Rotaract
