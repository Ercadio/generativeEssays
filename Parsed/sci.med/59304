From Subject Re Candida yeast Bloom Fact or Fiction In article David Rind writes In article writes I don't like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical in my opinion Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous cyanide release by the This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile whether licensed or not as a There are unethical behaviors such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees which I would not lable as quackish but prescribing known ineffective therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a David Rind One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical literature to keep up with changes in medical All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved to me anyway that laetril was ineffective against A physician who continued to use it when better more effective treatments are available may deserve to be called a Anti fungals are in a different The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics Gorden Rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection systemic is a real problem and just because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti fungal Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida The arguement is that without proof no action is Medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this There has always been the use of conventional A very good example is kidney Conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it Through the recent New England J of Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic If it makes sense for livestock why doesn't it make sense for humans David We are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous If this were a standard part of medical practice as Gordon says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should Marty
