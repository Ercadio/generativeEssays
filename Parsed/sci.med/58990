From Pat Churchill Subject Re eye dominance In article Richard Silver writes Is there a right eye dominance eyedness as there is an overall right handedness in the population I mean do most people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted My right eye tends to cut out when I look at distant things my left eye when I am close I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without I thought that one way or another I would always be able to see Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can no longer see close up objects Maybe it's just that my arms are getting shorter The floggings will continue until morale improves Pat Churchill Wellington New Zealand
