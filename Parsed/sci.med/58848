from mark feblowitz subject re is msg sensitivity superstition in article qhu s steve pope writes it's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as a double-blind study on the effects of msg, by virtue of the fact that msg changes the taste of food in a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and that cannot be duplicated by a placebo. common! you can easily disguise to flavor of msg by putting it in a
capsule. then, the study becomes a double blind of msg capsules
against control capsules (containing exactly the same contents minus
the msg).
