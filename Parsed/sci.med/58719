From Lee Lady Subject Re Science and Methodology In article Michael Holloway writes In article Lee Lady writes I would also like to point out that most of the arguments about science in are not about cases where people are rejecting scientific argument evidence They are about cases where no adequate scientific research has been In some cases there is quite a bit of evidence but it isn't in a format to fit doctrinaire conceptions of what science Here it is This indicates confusion between proof and the process of doing You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end As an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively But there is nothing objective about the process of If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a This is where you and I disagree with In order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC Without this one does not have any hypotheses worth No hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical It depends on the quality of their It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical And it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious
