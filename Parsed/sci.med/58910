From Lee Lady Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy tradition In article Russell Turpin writes I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in this Gee Maybe I've misjudged you Anyone who agrees with something I say can't be all Seriously I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not in one I still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding And I still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what's true and what's Deleted material which I agree Back to Lee Lady These are not the rules according to many who post to and According to these posters If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological A carefully Rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of To reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously Okay so let's see if we agree on this FIRST of all there are degrees of It might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain On the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate In this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful SECONDLY it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is I come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in and occasionally in about NLP Neurolinguistic Programming Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the NLP methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific And most especially to be aware of the questions NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific Over and over again the response I get in is If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to To me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme There've got to be controlled studies position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia Trauma Simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world's most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating Post traumatic Stress It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of PTSD once for each traumatic incident The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at Now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this Especially if as NLPers claim the success rate is extremely Take someone with a fear of heights as I used to have Take them up to a balcony on the floor and observe their Spend minutes to have them do the simple Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be More long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has In any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted To the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few My own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different NLP technique before I learned of the Fast Phobia Trauma Ten years later now I enjoy living on the floor of my building and having a large The folks over in have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that NLP practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to Most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems And since they're not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific The Fast Phobia Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying We don't have any way of knowing that it's These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say Why should I prove your theory and The burden of proof is on the one making the One academic in said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific It's described in a number of books and I've posted articles in describing it in as much detail as I'm capable Actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed To me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you If so I In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious
