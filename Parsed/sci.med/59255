From Jacquelin Aldridge Subject Re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy Jacquelin Aldridge writes I decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added G writes Hi it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position I was Next I noticed that when I ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got However if I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it wasn't as much of a So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid fatty This makes sense and because I was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have been avoiding these foods on my But I'm still able to eat foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat But doc wants me to be on a non fat This means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin I do this anyway No nuts fried food cheese I am allowed skim She said I should avoid anything sweet bananas Also I must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice She said I can't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or I'm concerned because I understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive And if G For one week she probably wants to see how you react to the If it changes You can live on the diet but you need to up your non fat Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked Smaller meals but more of Not terrific amounts of meat it's hard to digest First even fish fowl and breads have Second the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs Third your body like most peoples wasn't bred to live on a high fat modern If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat how people enjoyed This was because it was so Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach Is the baby still coming Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs How tight are your You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your Be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive Try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being Easier on your legs circulation as You might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this Especially if she's But this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if You don't want to become ill with it while you are If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting etc that helps them avoid Also I don't think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat Nausea can vary from person to person and with each My first pregnancy was During the second I had very little Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their grain of salt here Good luck Jackie
