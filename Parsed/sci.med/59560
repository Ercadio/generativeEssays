From Steve Dyer Subject Re thyroidal deficiency In article Erik The Viking writes She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary tests and her values were regarded as The doctor and my wife are not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the gland giving life long dependency to the drug hormone This is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is reported here is what the doctor actually If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic she'll need insulin That doesn't mean she's dependent on insulin anymore than she was beforehand if her body doesn't make enough she'll have to get it Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and it's really the only effective therapy available Plus it's Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but that's a feature not a bug and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isn't producing There isn't a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given some drops to re activate either her thyroidal gland and or the 'message center' in the brain sorry about the approximate language but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are but the brain area is called the 'hypofyse' in Homeopathy is Tell her to stop wasting her money health and time and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the right Steve Dyer aka ima harvard rayssd linus spdcc dyer
