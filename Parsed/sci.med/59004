From Peter Kaminski Subject Re Krillean Photography Newsgroups added followups set to most appropriate In Brian Huey writes I am looking for any information supplies that will allow do it yourselfers to take Krillean It's Kirlian Krillean pictures are portraits of tiny One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe as we know it has its own energy I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at degrees Kelvin will have its own energy signature the interesting questions are what kind of energy and what it I'd check places like Edmund Scientific are they still in business or I wonder if you can find ex Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere in the Some expansion on Kirlian photography From the credulous side Stanway Andrew Alternative Medicine A Guide To Natural Therapies ISBN New York Viking Penguin A not overly critical but still useful overview of alternative health Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate' their subjects they photographed They found that if an object was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically They found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to The object's life activity was also visible in highly variable colour High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and others have been produced in Brazil Austria and Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing Normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other They argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isn't actually ill but is about to They claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is the phantom During high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up This is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see' the legs of amputees as if they were still The important thing about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg The energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary From the incredulous side MacRobert Alan Reality shopping a consumer's guide to new age Whole Earth Review Autumn An excellent article providing common sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims and some of the author's favorite examples of The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study making grand discoveries in his Many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people Kirlian photography for If you pump high voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a It took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual In fact Kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John Pehek Harry Kyler and David Faust who reported their findings in the October issue of Their conclusion The variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious auras or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental Nevertheless television shows magazines and books many by famous parapsychologists continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of the Peter Kaminski
