From Rich Haller Subject ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT T and appears to take a different approach from other It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness' This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though I think the phrase is What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to This means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to cps and then falls off a cliff Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise Rich Haller University of Oregon Eugene OR USA
