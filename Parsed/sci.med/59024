From Steve Giammarco Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article Andrew Rogers writes In article writes Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand Do you believe that they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes They just extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about years ago that the natural MSG extracted from the sources you mention above does not cause the reported aftereffects it's only that nasty artificial MSG extracted from coal tar or whatever that causes Chinese Restaurant I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it I was under the possibly incorrect assumption that most of the MSG on our foods was made from processing sugar Is this not true Are there other sources of MSG I am one of those folx who react sometimes strongly to However I also react strongly to sodium chloride table salt in Each causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest upper left Steve Giammarco Peterson Lane Dallas TX
