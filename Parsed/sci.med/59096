From Gordon Banks Subject Re HELP for Kidney Stones In article writes My girlfriend is in pain from kidney She says that because she has no medical insurance she cannot get them My question Is there any way she can treat them herself or at least mitigate their effects Any help is deeply Advice referral to literature Morphine or demerol is about the only effective way of stopping pain that Obviously she'll need a prescription to get such Can't she go to the county hospital or something Gordon Banks Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and it is shameful to surrender it too
