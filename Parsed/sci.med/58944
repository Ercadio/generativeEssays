From Jim Zisfein Subject Re Post Polio Syndrome Information Needed Please DN From David Nye DN Briefly this is a condition in which patients who have significant DN residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the DN weakness as they get One theory is that the remaining motor DN neurons have to work harder and so die If this theory were true the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units it doesn' Instead the biopsy shows scattered angulated atrophic This is more consistent with load shedding by chronically overworked motor neurons the neurons survive at the expense of increasingly denervated SLMR E mail Jim Zisfein
