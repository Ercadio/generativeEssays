from tarl neustaedter subject re krillean photography in article , brian m huey writes i think that's the correct spelling.. the proper spelling is kirlian. it was an effect discoverd by
s. kirlian, a soviet film developer in 1939. as i recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges
and chemical reactions between the organic material and the silver
halides in the films. -- tarl neustaedter stratus computer marlboro, mass.
