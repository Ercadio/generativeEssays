From Eric Jacquier Subject Opinions on Allergy Hay Fever shots Hello, I am interested in trying this desensitization method against hay fever What is the state of affairs about this I went to a doctor and paid for a minute interview scratches, leading to the diagnostic that I am allergic to June and Timothy grass I believe this From now on it looks like shots per week for months followed by shot per month or so Each shot costs Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I would call that a racket We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office Apart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever Is that right Thanks for information Ej
