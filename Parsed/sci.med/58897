From OPIRG Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article Steve Dyer writes In article OPIRG writes Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses You mean the responses some of which pointed to double blind tests which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG it's elicited by the placebo as Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people Similarly debunking such claims without doing research whether literature and lab is equally beside the The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is Placebos are all very interesting but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG You could have real effects and placebo effects people may have allergies in Yet again the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge Like youself Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition Have you read Olney's work I fail to see how citing results from peer reviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John Olney a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive No it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease just to name a This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in People are not receiving intra ventricular injections of Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra The Glu and Asp were administered Some studies used IV and Intra ventricular is not a normal method for food studies for obvious You must not have read the peer reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown Sez Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the journals Have you done a thorough literature search But you're right mice aren't the best to study this They're four times less sensitive than humans to Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink Milligrams Compare that to a glass of Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG The point is exceeding the Of course they're amino Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any Olney's research compared infant human Specifically the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed Mother's milk was well below the effective Read Olney's review paper in Brain Res and check his They are There is no There most certainly is a Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects Steve Dyer aka ima harvard rayssd linus spdcc dyer Why am I not surprised Dianne Murray
