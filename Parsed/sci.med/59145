From David Rind Subject Re Thrush was Good Grief was Re Candida Albicans what is it In article McCurdy writes My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the disease that was being asked about systemic yeast There is no question that Candida albicans causes It also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush I've never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before though presumably it would work by the same mechanism Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes the systemic yeast syndrome David Rind
