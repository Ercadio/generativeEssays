From Subject Vitamin A and Infection I've sent Gordon my posts on protein vitamin C and vitamin A prior to posting on internet as a professional Somehow I've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text Gordon had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype Since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that PMS post I'm not going to cite any references Gordon has them I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan's new Nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the as far as infection is concerned vitamin A When vitamin A was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti infection Many people Linus Pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C which I've already covered Big mistake in my opinion Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as It's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic beta carotene is the plant form and it's completely Both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein RBP A normal human adult liver should have to of retinol We are born with in our autopsy has shown that about of Americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin A as they were born If you don't believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect But if you believe like I do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin A in the The RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is RE or of vitamin For adult feamles its RE or of vitamin Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A either retinol or Beta carotene from their But the NRC National Research Council was going to release a new RDA table in that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised C to per day and A to per day for adult males That report and it's recommendations was Why Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves Many scientist in the feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 's get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves We know from autopsy that only about of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve to I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their But for vitamin A only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level levels above dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol The normal range of serum retinol will be Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of dl or higher Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Wallach a Little Brown Series book This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach as you will see later in this Between dl and dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it's time to stop just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies Beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of But taking Beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up I've seen estimates of years if you are in the that only has as much as you were born with in your liver One other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires In addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection The body uses vitamin A retinol for many different Vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin Reproduction uses the retinol form and some Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic How do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid You use enzymes one of which requires vitamin C this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin A Vitamin C does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic If you increase your intake of vitamin C you will increase your formation of retinoic But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it's formed it's used and then lost to the This is why the NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA' Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A they actually do themselves more harm than Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody In the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood The mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against For cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide Cancer has two distinct steps DNA alteration and cell For cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta Chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa OU's branch campus and when I give CME Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to of The serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below to Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out In one study done on Spanish Americans where serum retinol levels were measured of the sample population had a serum retinol level below As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A Here are excerpts from their book Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone Protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is to Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body Serum levels greater than dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated The bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely A daily intake of more than about of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and They recommend of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for Their toxic serum retinol level is very I recommend that my students try in adults that are having problems with chronic They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run or if their clinical lab can't run it I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin At per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin Recall that the PMS papers were using to of vitamin I don't suggest that my students use these high If you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good without having to worry about If they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum But vitamin A retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is of retinol per Beta carotene will never have this effect on the human Could just taking Beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help Yes but the effect will take a long time to My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by But when we have the 's in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A Marty
