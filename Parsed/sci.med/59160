From Rich Young Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article Steve Pope writes The mass of anectdotal evidence combined with the lack of a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving the hypothesis makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the most likely explanation for The following is from a critique of a Minutes presentation on MSG which was aired on November The critique comes from THE TUFTS DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER February for Chances are good that if you watched ' Minutes' last November you came away feeling MSG is bad for In the segment entitled 'No MSG ' for instance show host Ed Bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 'millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently sick' peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal and speaks of studies on MSG that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items causes What he does NOT make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on One of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist Patricia Williams says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get headaches from 'But ' she explains 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the ' A second lapse comes with mention of John Olney a professor at the Washington University School of Medicine who Bradley remarks 'says that his years of research with laboratory animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because it poses a threat of irreversible brain Olney's research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human In fact only under extreme circumsrtances did Olney's experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected extremely high doses of MSG into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly and when he used tubes to force feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty Of course neither of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in MSG with And most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little reaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for human blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in Olney's lab The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of that And so does the European Communities' Scientific Committee for after examining numerous studies have concluded that MSG is Their determination makes sense considering that MSG has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a burning sensation among In fact the most fail safe of clinical studies the double blind has consistently exonerated the much maligned That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains The reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken down into glutamate during It's a breakdown that occurs Glutamic acid is the most abundant of the or so amino acids in the It makes up about percent of the protein in flesh foods percent in milk percent in corn and percent in whole That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore sensitive to consensus reached by large international professional organizations is that MSG is safe the same consensus reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at Rich Young These are not Kodak's
