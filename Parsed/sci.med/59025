From Donald Mackie Donald M Subject Re OB GYN residency In article David Nye writes I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against Is that true I know some that won't even interview I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory particularly if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't offered an interview but I don't know if it has ever gone to FMGs who are not citizens are like all aliens in a difficult Only citizens get to vote here so non citizens are of little or no interest to Also the non citizen may well be in the middle of processing for resident alien There is a stron sense that rocking the boat suing a residency program will delay the granting of that status perhaps for Don Mackie his opinions
