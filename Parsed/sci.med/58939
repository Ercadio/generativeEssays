from carl j lydick subject re glutamate in article , jason chen writes there is no contradiction here it is essential in the sense that your
=body needs it. it is non-essential in the sense that your body can
=produce enough of it without supplement. and when you're in a technical discussion of amino acids, it's the latter
definition that's used almost universally.

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below). so
unless what i'm saying is directly related to vax/vms, don't hold me or my
organization responsible for it. if it is related to vax/vms, you can try to
hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
