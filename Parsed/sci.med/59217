From Subject Re Homeopathy a respectable medical tradition In article C y zr B , Gordon Banks writes In article C qMJJ yB ampex com Rayaz Jagani writes From Miranda Castro, The Complete Homeopathy Handbook , ISBN , oringinally published in Britain in From Page , and in , when the National Health Service was established, homeopathy was included as an officially approved method of treatment I was there in I suppose it must have died out since , then Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back It pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of validated it for them then I told them that the name was the same but the practice was different oh If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very sure of the validity of your philosophy I believe in , the NHS was still having its nurses taught the fine art of cupping , which is the vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath David N Chorley Yikes, I'm agreeing with Gordon Banks
