resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system federal health officials said The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in states and killed at least four said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled Emerging Infectious Diseases to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report which has a wide circulation in the health The issue also will top the agenda of a two day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it said Ruth Berkelman deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious There were more cases of malaria in the in than in any year since the and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic the first in this century she Resistance of disease causing agents to antibiotics is also a We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past Berkleman She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States the CDC It cited the emergence since the of a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes such as Escherichia coli a deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis C virus HIV the virus that causes AIDS Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas the CDC It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug SOURCE WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE HEADLINE Lyme Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage legal A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flu like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the The decision by District Judge Robert Ward in New York came after a week long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the He ordered the New York state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical expenses and lost Summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling says Stephen Kass an attorney at New York law firm Berle Kass Case who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially Lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren't unheard A summer vacationer in Southampton last year sued the owner of the home she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted In also on Long Island a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than million to a patron who was stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent The judge later threw out the award citing no evidence that a beehive was near the But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country it's most prevalent in New England the Middle Atlantic states Wisconsin Minnesota and the Northwest may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the Lawyers say worker's compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent Payments in worker's compensation cases however are limited to medical costs and lost The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of Unlike the worker's compensation process the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a result for additional payments for pain and Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the Ira Maurer a partner at New York law firm Elkind Flynn Maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove For one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being The workers who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other Earlier this week the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease Because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme Last year at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes Becton Dickinson began using Damminix a pesticide made by EcoHealth of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the The medical supply company's headquarters include a acre park and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get Ruth Lister a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis says that many youth
