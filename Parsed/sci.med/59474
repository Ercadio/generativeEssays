From Jeff Silva Subject Re HELP for Kidney Stones wrote My girlfriend is in pain from kidney She says that because she has no medical insurance she cannot get them My question Is there any way she can treat them herself or at least mitigate their effects Any help is deeply Advice referral to literature Thank you Dave Carvell First off I would consider the severity of the I had stones several years ago and there's now way I could have made it without heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would dissolve If the stones are passible the best thing she could do is drink LOTS of water and hope that they pass but every time they move a little the pain will be I was told by my doctor at that time that the pain was comparable to that of Yes by a male doctor so I'm sure some of you women will disagree I'd really like to know the truth in this so maybe some of you women who have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me Jeff Silva
