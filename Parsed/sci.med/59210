From Gordon Banks Subject Re Homeopathy a respectable medical tradition In article C qMJJ yB ampex com Rayaz Jagani writes From Miranda Castro, The Complete Homeopathy Handbook , ISBN , oringinally published in Britain in From Page , and in , when the National Health Service was established, homeopathy was included as an officially approved method of treatment I was there in I suppose it must have died out since , then Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you Gordon Banks N JXP Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon
