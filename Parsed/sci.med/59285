From David Dodell Subject Medical News Part cut here call for employers to keep information about the HIV status of health care workers But doctors who know of an HIV positive colleague who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory The guidelines also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health care A model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the In addition a advisory panel on HIV infection in health care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine' Nature Volvovitz Franklin and Smith Gale The questions raised by Moore et about recombinant envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV produced by MicroGeneSys are advantages rather than disadvantages write Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden Moore et says that in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the receptor and that this recombinant does not stimulate the same antibodies as the HIV virus does in natural But vaccination with recombinant in patients infected with HIV broadens HIV specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to epitopes and and cytotoxic T cell Volvovitz and Smith claim that they never intended their molecule to be identical to the native Antibody responses against native HIV proteins including the types described by Moore et exist in nearly all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April progression of HIV In addition the binding of or antibody complexes to has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV The absence of binding by the MicroGeneSys vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety Phase I studies have demonstrated stable counts stimulation of cytotoxic T cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune Based on these and other clinical results MicroGeneSys was chosen by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the first phase III vaccine therapy studies conclude Volvovitz and HIV Infection Breast Milk and HIV Transmission Lancet Mok Jacqueline There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV positive women breastfeeding their babies writes Jacqueline Mok of the The anti

infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS concludes Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients Journal of the American Medical Association Dickinson Gordon et If universal precautions are practiced the risk of HIV transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal write Gordon Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April et of the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami The researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed and DNA sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their HIV to that of the Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of years were examined in There were patients who had undergone procedures of whom were An examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with HIV infection all of whom were either homosexuals or IV drug The researchers were able to detect of the remaining patients and agreed to be HIV infection was reported in five of the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely The study suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude Dickinson et April AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB Study Says Washington Post Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in today's New England Journal of People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria But a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new TB infection doctors Peter Small of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be necessary for some people to use TB medicines The study examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how the germs changed over time in patients at Kings County Hospital in New HIV Infection

proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS the hypothesis that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically AZT and psychologically positive AIDS test toxic public health initiatives writes Peter Duesberg of the University of California In the Lancet's March issue Schechter et call Duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and AZT lead to AIDS a hindrance to public health However their hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not attained any public health The government spends billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this Schechter et conclude that HIV has a key role in depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from However their survey neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug AIDS hypothesis because it does not provide controls confirmed drug free AIDS cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to years HIV positive patients who use recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as positives who do not do The year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause Alternatively they could show that HIV free individuals who have used drugs for years never get AIDS defining illnesses concludes Rapid Decline of Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV Infection Lancet Vento Sandro et Interferon IFN which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings may hasten T cell loss in some HIV infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions write Sandro Vento et of the Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro The researchers report three asymptomatic HIV infected individuals with hepatitis C Virus related chronic active hepatitis CAH who had a rapid profound decline of cells after All three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum HIV antigen and had circulating antibodies to Sera from all three patients obtained at the end of IFN treatment and testing in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of HIV These autoantibodies which also recognize native class II molecules and may contribute to the elimination of T cells in vivo were at low tires in all three patients six months after stopping Such autoantibodies were not detected in other patients with HIV infection and HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not experience T cell loss in some HIV infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune The subjects had and HLA antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cell counts and clinical progression of HIV IFN can induce a very rapid decline of cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these HLA haplotypes the researchers April TB Makes a Comeback State Government News Voit William and Knapp Elaine Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the United States it is emerging again among the homeless AIDS patients immigrants minorities and Lee Reichman professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey Medical School and president of the American Lung Association said Right now it's a big city problem but potentially it's everyone's The ALA predicts that million Americans are infected with TB and about percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed especially those with AIDS or Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Tammes a Centers for Disease Control expert said that is why the CDC has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS with TB State health officials believe the TB is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with In addition the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health In New York City TB is an epidemic because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people said George Diferdinando director of the New York State TB According to Diferdinando curbing the spread of TB entails keeping percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in About percent of infected New York City residents don't complete When TB patients don't finish taking their medication multi drug resistant TB can develop which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in Southern Florida Artifact or Reality American Journal of Public Health Nwanyanwu Okey et The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of risk write Okey Nwanyanwu et of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta The researchers investigated such AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach All of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of HIV Medical records of patients in addition to records from social services HIV counseling and testing centers and sexually transmitted disease STD clinics were If no other HIV risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized Once STD clinic and other medical records were reviewed men and women were reclassified into other HIV transmission After adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of AIDS cases reported from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January and March that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from percent to percent among men and from percent to percent among While the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases it still remained above the national average
