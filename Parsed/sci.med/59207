From Subject How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation I got asked in Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney Not long after I got into I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone I'm going to state it again But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take Read on to find out why I have my asbestos suit on now guys Vitamin C will form oxalic But large doses are needed above grams per day Review Article Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C But glycine also forms oxalic acid D amino acid oxidases For both glycine and vitamin C one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones to mg of each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria Patients receiving at least each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate For gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination D amino acid oxidases For vitamin C the effect is quite There are different pathways for vitamin C The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic But this is highly variable and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic At very high doses of vitamin C above grams per day more of the extra vitamin C more than conversion can end up as oxalic In a very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from per day up to per Until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and dose grams jumped it to over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin that we don't know about Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires Differences in levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism Increasing your intake of would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C Since the typical American diet is deficient in some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut Diets providing to of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate Urol If was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate Here are the high oxalate foods Beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and Contain at least Beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet Contain to mg If the threshold is per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food A recent article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at If you also increase your intake of you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at The RDA for is per day for males and per day for females directly related to protein intake can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months The USDA food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and per day for females living in the Coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block absorption are metabolic antagonists of or promote excretion in the Common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and I tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of Any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca Mg dietary ratio is Magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium The magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi Urol Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction Article Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones Presse There are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John in jumped all over I guess that he doesn't read the medical Oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them I thought I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's Martin Banschbach Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman
