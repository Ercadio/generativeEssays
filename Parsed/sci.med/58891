From Keith Lynch Subject Re My New Diet IT WORKS GREAT In article Gordon Banks writes Keith is the only person I have ever heard of that keeps the weight off without any conscious effort to control eating most of us have to diet a lot to keep from going back to morbid I attribute my success to several factors Very low Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me I only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran I estimate I only get about to percent of my calories from Very little sugar or Very high Most Americans get about to are I get between and Sometimes I've heard of people taking fiber It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat Tablets are just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them My clean your plate conditioning works for Eating the last takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch up so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something I don't eat when I'm not hungry unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly and eating won't be practical then I bike to work miles a day year I also bike to stores movies and everywhere else as I've never owned a I estimate this burns about calories a It also helps build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance diabetes runs in my family and increase my Even so my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the F and usually wear a sweater if it drops to Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been Fortunately it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent Obviously I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't I think all of us One's success depends on how large the fluctuations in the cycle Some people can cycle only I'm sure everyone's weight cycles whether or not they've ever been I usually eat extremely little When I do eat something salty my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten It comes off again over a week or Keith Lynch f p s q x f f q f f p 'q s q p f w q p x
