From Scott Ballantyne Subject Re Burzynski's Antineoplastons In article Josh Schwimmer writes Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be Burzynski's work is not too None of his A through A antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental The NCI conducted tests of A and A against leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing These were in and Burzynski claims that A is the active factor common to all of A and A something which he has not shown A has only been extracted from A He also hasn't shown that A through A are actually distinct substances The NCI conducted a series of tests using A against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes leukemia non small cell and small cell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal A exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels It is necessary to process A since it is not soluble Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG which he calls AS PAG is not an information carrying peptide something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic AS also derived from A is a mixture of PA and PA also not a peptide can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about a A is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely In spite of this similarity A does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory early research past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be sdb
