From Dick King Subject Re Krillean Photography In article C oIL Alexander P Zijdenbos writes FLAME ON Especially the USA should be grateful after all, Columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth WITH COUNTERFLAME ENABLED Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail It was also well known that the circumference was about K miles, and that you could not reach Asia bo going west with current technology you would neither be able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing weather Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world Instead, they expected him to die at sea Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only K miles, making the trip practical Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is indeed K miles Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right about where Asia would have been had the circumference been K miles My source is the recent PBS series on Columbus FLAME OFF, or end sermon Alex
