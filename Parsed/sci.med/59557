From Bill Wilder Subject Seeking info on retinal detachment I am quite near I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to weld this back in place as My right eye seems In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the Since the treatment two weeks these flashes are now occuring more often several each The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord if it tugs enough I may well face retinal I am seeking via additional info on retinal The did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can Of most interest to me If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect Do the symptoms fairly frequent flashes imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for Many thanks Bill Bill Wilder Computer Systems Manager Kentville Research Station Agriculture Canada Kentville Nova Scotia
