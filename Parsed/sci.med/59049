From Steve Dyer Subject Re Good Grief was Re Candida Albicans what is it In article Jon Noring writes There is no convincing evidence that such a disease There's a lot of evidence it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is Ah there go my sinuses For example Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives Oh A classic Hey they laughed at Einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as Nizoral to his new patients IF they've been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two He's kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus Of course this is only the beginning for his Yeah I'll Tomorrow the Listen uncontrolled studies like this are In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' I agree it is a poorly written book extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors which I never had before started in November Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two I'm also greatly improved in other areas as I'm sure you You sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle Of course I have allergy symptoms I am especially allergic to molds yeasts It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible Yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some Yeah it sounds reasonable to me Of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies Oh really What tests Immune compromised my More like credulous This is a psychiatric can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not One almost has to take an empirical approach to Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical You know it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this It's ridiculously expensive and potentially The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough so it gets abused by BTW some would say to try Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the The only good thing about nystatin is that it's relatively cheap and when taken orally non But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given IV it would be without any effect on your I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like That would solve the yeast problem once and for In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection' I cannot guarantee their For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket I'd hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards Steve Dyer aka ima harvard rayssd linus spdcc dyer
