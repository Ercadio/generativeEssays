From Stephen Kelley Subject Re Should I be angry at this doctor In article writes Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor Last Saturday evening my year old son cut his finger badly with a I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at The story deleted be My son did get three stitches at the emergency I'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a We will certainly never set foot in that clinic The people in charge already know what kind of 'care' they are providing and they don't give a rat's ass about your repeat You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers and broadcast news If you do keep the letter short and to the point so they don't discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what you are upset It's possible that the local health department can help you complain to someone official but really that 'clinic' exists for the sole purpose of generating walk in income through advertising and nothing you can do will change them all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid I'm glad it sounds like your son did ok My opinion only of course Steve
