From Steve Dyer Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article OPIRG writes So far I've seen about a dozen posts of anecdotal evidence but no I suspect there is a strong psychological effect at work Does anyone have results from a scientific study using double blind trials Check out just some posts before your Um I hate to break this to you but article numbers are unique per They have no meaning on other Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses You mean the responses some of which pointed to double blind tests which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG it's elicited by the placebo as Yet again the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge Like youself Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John Olney a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive No it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease just to name a This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in People are not receiving intra ventricular injections of and that its major constituent glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain humans included I don't know about premier but it's certainly an important Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown Sez Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they're not relevant to the matter at Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink Milligrams Compare that to a glass of Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG By eating lots of junk food packaged soups and diet soft drinks it is possible to jack your blood levels so high that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous real Notice the subtle covering of her ass here anyone with a sensitivity We're disputing the size of that Read Olney's review paper in Brain Res and check his They are There is no There most certainly is a Steve Dyer aka ima harvard rayssd linus spdcc dyer
