From John Angelo Gnassi Subject Re Candida yeast Bloom Fact or Fiction In an article Jon Noring writes In article David Rind writes Do you believe that any quacks exist How about quack diagnoses Is true focus of the medical The AMA and the Boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search and destroy missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional accepted medicine cannot If I prescribe itraconazole for a patient's sinusitis neither the AMA FDA State Licensing Board nor ABFP will be knocking on my door to ask This is a specious on their backs and pee pee on themselves in What do they teach you in medical school how to throw your authority around Among other things how to evaluate new theories and Let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word lacking in any Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at Funny I thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers Dorland's Certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming from any medical doctor or wanna be where competency is expected is real The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more It is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it and the quacksalver knows so or error if the honest practitioner doesn't know Failure to speak out against either bespeaks may I suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated May I reply seriously that if the practitioners and proponents of non scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and John Angelo Gnassi Lab of Computer Science Massachusetts General Hospital Eternal Student Boston Massachusetts USA The Earth be spanned connected by a Network Walt Whitman
