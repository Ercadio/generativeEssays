From Russell Turpin Subject Re Science and Methodology In article Lee Lady writes The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical It depends on the quality of their It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross Above Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller In most of this thread I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post doc physicist is the quality of their But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as If you don't like these choose your I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do Let me approach this from a second When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many kinds of criticism that one can One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or Another kind of criticism is that the work while technically correct is either not important or not The first difference is the one that I have been pointing The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a This is where you and I disagree with I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims not just of some of its proposed Similarly I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work what it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests the presence of In order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random Certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the In areas where we do not yet have this I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller Let's face it we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we Russell
