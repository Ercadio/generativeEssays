From Subject Depression Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good maybe in some cases with good reason In this post on depression I'm laying it all I'll continue to post here because I think that I have some knowledge that could be Once you have read this post you should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the In article Lida Chaplynsky writes A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on by menopause as well as a mental break She is being treated with Halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her psychiatrist are not Someone suggested contacting a nutritionist to discuss alternative Since she is sensitive to medication I think this is a good suggestion but don't know where to If anyone can suggest a Philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read I'd appreciate Lida I can emphasize with your Both my wife and I suffered from bouts of Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and Lida I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist When severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped I tried to use supplements to bring her out of I had cured her PMS using supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as It didn't work and she was put on Prozac by her Two Winters ago three years after by wife's breast cancer I got hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor I tried to take care of it for several months with Didn't My internist ended up putting me on I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using niacin folate and to cure I'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like I Lida I do believe that depression can have a dietary But the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the For chemotherapy I knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be Same thing for I was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was pretty Depression is just too What you really need is a nutritional This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient For every vitamin and mineral except vitamin C you have a The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical Stress will increase your need for many vitamins and This is when your reserves become very Lida without your permission I'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and where I'm coming I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic Medical schools for ten years I've written my own textbook because none was What I teach is not a rehash of I preach nutrient reserves yes

Pyridoxine Pantothenic and Folic acids Biotin and Other Nutrient Factors Enteral Nutrition Parenteral Nutrition Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature to find material that I can use in my nutrition I last did this in the Summer of I read everything that I can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have and Opposite each page of written text which I write myself I've pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted Since this material is only being used for educational purposes I can get around the copyright laws so far I can not send this material out to newsgroup readers as I've been asked to do I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need to make my education program This lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer Cancer Treatment Centers of America which is a private for profit organization with hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma Tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical I also believe that the Pritikin Clinic in California has a similiar lab For physicians reading this post I would suggest that you get the new Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published Feb by I have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics a Little Brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more to residency Two 's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient's nutritional Let me quote a few sentences from the Preface of this new text So called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of Unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the United States require no formal instruction in But times and medical practice have More than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ Roland Weinsier MD DrPH Lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile Menopause is often a time when women suffer There are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during A nutritionist may also be able to Not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was There are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not Checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going If you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under CLIA the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis Nutritionist IV and other software programs But there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti depressants will probably continue to be the best
