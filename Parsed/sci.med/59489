From Heather Subject re earwax Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic Too much can block the external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some hearing It is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your own or at your physician's You can take a syringe no needles and fill it with warm water cold can cause fainting and OTC hydrogen Then point the ear towards the ceiling about degrees up and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and firmly expell the Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax this could take several If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever you may If wax is old it will be harder and You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the Do this for a couple days then try syringing It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it Good Luck heather
