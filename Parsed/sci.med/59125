Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier Again thank you to all who gave I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition It runs under Windows and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard When initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document I would like scanned and in what Once an image is scanned you can bring up the Pop Up image The software gives you two errors at this Blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in Yellow shade which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted correctly at I have found that the software should give itself more It is usually correct instead of If a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about I find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal After a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax I use HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April an Intel Satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a PCX DCX While most of my faxes were received in standard mode dpi the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was Overall a very impressive The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user specialized words is just too If anyone has any specific questions please do not hesitate to send me HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Emerging Infectious Diseases SOURCE MMWR DATE Apr Introduction Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United Since the early the public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes Escherichia coli hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis TB have increased in many Furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis TB and staphylococcal infections Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs This issue of MMWR introduces a new series Emerging Infectious Future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health This first article updates the ongoing

illness peaked from January through January Of the casepatients were hospitalized developed HUS and three The median age of patients was years range years Idaho Following the outbreak report from Washington the Division of Health Idaho Department of Health and Welfare identified persons with culture confirmed coli infection with illness onset dates from December through February Figure Four persons were hospitalized one developed During the week preceding illness onset had eaten at a chain A California In late December the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with coli infection who subsequently Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with coli infections or HUS from mid November through mid January Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April four at a chain B restaurant in San After the Washington outbreak was reported reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December and January compared with the same period year A case was defined as postdiarrheal

eating hamburgers at chain A matched OR CI Other Investigation Findings During the outbreak chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular sized hamburger patties produced on November some of the same meat was used in jumbo patties produced on November The outbreak strain of coli was isolated from lots of patties produced on those two dates these lots had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness Approximately of the implicated patties were recovered by the A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for

for Infectious Diseases Editorial Note coli is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS the most common cause of acute renal failure in Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated Preliminary data from a CDC year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for coli that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other Infection with coli often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April SMAC medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and Illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop HUS which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of coli in the absence of routine Despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for coli using SMAC agar When infections with coli are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further coli lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during CDC is collaborating with the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as coli entering the meat Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are In this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important The Food and Drug Administration FDA has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to F C FDA personal communication Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by coli and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of coli

United States almost tripled from through Long term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products CDC's National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement NHIS HPDP collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to This report summarizes findings from this The NHIS HPDP supplement asked Have you used snuff at least times in your entire life and Do you use snuff now Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least times and not using either at the time of the Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least cigarettes and who were not smoking Ever smokers included current and former Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for persons aged greater than or equal to years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national Confidence intervals CIs were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis SUDAAN In an estimated million adults were current users of smokeless tobacco including million men and For all categories of comparison the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among For men the prevalence of use was highest among those aged years Table for women the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and whites the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians Alaskan Natives and Among both men and women prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April men and women below the poverty level this difference was significant only for women p less than Table Among men the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged years but varied considerably by age the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group Table Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to An estimated million CI adults reported being former smokeless tobacco Among ever users the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was CI Among persons aged years the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users CI than among chewing tobacco users CI Among persons aged years the proportion of former users was similar for snuff CI and chewing tobacco CI Among current users of smokeless tobacco CI currently smoked CI formerly smoked and CI never In comparison among current smokers CI were current users of smokeless Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users CI than among chewing tobacco users CI Reported by Office on Smoking and Health National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Div of Health Interview Statistics National Center for Health Statistics Editorial Note The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young Adolescent and young adult males in particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further For example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons In this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke In the NHIS HPDP the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco In a previous study among college students of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter Page Volume Number April occasionally In addition approximately of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking Health care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette The national health objectives for the year have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use including males aged years to no more than by the year objective and American Indian Alaskan Native youth to no more than by the year objective Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco control efforts enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging health care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow up providing school based prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school sponsored events References Office of Evaluations and Spit tobacco
