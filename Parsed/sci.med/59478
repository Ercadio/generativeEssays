From Barry Shell Subject Great Canadian Scientists About two years ago I posted the following I am planning to write a new book called Great Canadian Please forward your nominations to me The rules are that the person must be a Canadian They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada but they must have or have had if they are dead Canadian citizenship while they are were great Canadian About people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness and there may be a gray area If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness I would be pleased to hear In any event please nominate people even if you are not sure they are I would like as big a list as Please give me a name and email address phone number or mail address so that I can contact the If you don't know any of the above then give me their last known Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian After I have the list I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine or some other dramatic The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph If you have any other ideas about this project I am interested to hear So far I have received nominations as follows First Name Last Name Nominator Famous For Sid Altman Kuszewski John Catalytic RNA Nobel Chem Frederick Banting me Insulin Nobel medicine Davidson Black Stanley Robert Discovered

Wilson Collier John Continental Drift theory Wright Palmer Bill Chem mosquito repellant Allen Yen Leone Pasquale VL baseline interferometry Walter Zinn me Breader Reactor Can The list is growing It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Actually there are many more who were born in Canada but became Americans after graduate Please note a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish American with a summer home in Now I know this is debatable but please don't nominate him If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list please drop me a That was two years Since then I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged though this may change again It will have about two page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text graphic boxes all around on the following subjects Vital statistics and photo of the scientist Personal statement from the scientist Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist What I was doing when I was So you want to be a insert kind of scientist Experiment you can There will be an appendix with more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double The whole thing will then be published on CD ROM with video and sound clips for added I am looking for a CD ROM publisher as The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being Hope to find one I would like to again ask for more nominations especially in the pure sciences of Physics Chemistry and Also criticisms of the list are Also women and French Canadian scientists are I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists and to discuss what is great what is Canadian and what is scientist Please respond to or Barry Shell Quebec Vancouver Canada Thanks to all who responded
