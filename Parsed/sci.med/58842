From jimj Jim Jones Subject Post fever rashes I get 'em every time The subject line says it every time I run a fever I get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and Fortunately it doesn't The rash always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was cold flu It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town although I don't know if that has anything to do with Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever a severe or long lasting fever brings a long lasting A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away Anybody know what might be causing this It's no more than an embarassment but I'd be curious to know what's going Am I carrying some kind of fever resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out its competition Jim Jones
