From Jason Chen Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition In article Mary Allison writes Two different Tuesdays two weeks apart we used the same day of the week just for consistancies sake we ordered food from the local Chinese take out same exact food except ONE of the days we had them hold the I did not know which time the food was ordered without the MSG but one time I had the reaction and one time I did NOW you can TRY to tell me that it wasn't scientific enough and that I have not PROVEN beyond the shadow of a doubt that I have a reaction to MSG but it was proof enough for ME and I'll have you know that I do NOT wish to get sick from eating food thank you very If you could not tell which one had MSG why restaurants bother to use it at all If you can taste the difference psychological reaction might play a The fact is MSG is part of natural Everyone I mean EVERYONE consumes certain amount of MSG every day through regular diet without the synthesized MSG Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand Do you believe that they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes They just extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat Baring MSG is just like baring sugar which many people react Jason Chen
