From Felix the Cat Subject Med school admission hi all, Ive applied for the class of at quite a number of schools and have gotten rejects, interviews and no responses Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out the number of their class in acceptances by mid March Whats going on I am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i kind of looked into Chiropractic and Podiatry but they really dont interest me Thanks Felix The Cat The Wonderful, Wonderful Cat Meow
