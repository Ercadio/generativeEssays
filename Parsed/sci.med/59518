From Subject Re Candida yeast Bloom Fact or Fiction In article Elisabeth Davidson writes In a previous article says least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the It's really too bad that most medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet I sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients systemic candida I think The Yeast Connection is a bunch of What does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught anyway Elisabeth let's set the record straight for the nth time I have not read The Yeast Connection So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this hated It's okay I guess to hate the book by why hate me Elisabeth I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology A book that you should be familiar with and not hate Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever Indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection candidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophils to see a systemic Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for Your assessment of candidiasis in the is correct and I do not dispute What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation GI tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida Let me quote from Zinsser's again However some factors such as the use of a broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections I was addressing mucosal infections I like the term blooms better The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure I guess that your nutrition course does not too Here is a brief primer on Yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast like Well maybe I'm getting picky but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the mold Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds depending on Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the Should we maybe call it a mold infection a fungus infection Maybe we should say it is caused by a mold like Martin Banschbach Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine West Tulsa You're the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didn't know that a yeast is a form of a fungus shudder Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying My my Elisabeth do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you If you noticed my faculty rank I'm a biochemist not a Candida is classifed as a fungus according to Zinsser's But as you point out it displays It is capable of producing yeast cells pseudohyphae and true Elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to To a biochemist it's a lot of So I called it a yeast like fungus go ahead and crucify You know Elisabeth I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I've said that it will make I'm not asking anyone here to buy into The Yeast Connection book because I don't know what's in that book plain and And to be honest with you I'm beginning to wish that it was never Marty
