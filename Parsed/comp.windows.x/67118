From Thad P Floryan Subject Re Is a headed Sun possible cgfour bwtwo In article r mg r fitz TC Cornell EDU matthew alchemy TN Cornell EDU Matthew Kleinmann writes I have a Sun that has a mono framebuffer bwtwo built on the motherboard The same system also has a cgfour cgfour and bwtwo daughterboard I have been using this system with a color monitor having a color front screen from the cgfour, and a mono back screen from the bwtwo , both on the same tube I recentley picked up a x Sun mono monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour and the bwtwo I do not care if I loose the back screen on the color tube from the bwtwo After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is possible Has anybody sucessfuly done this before If it's any consolation, I have two headed Sun systems, though the color and mono monitors for each are rated x Their configuration is the same as yours, so it should be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT I don't know if your hi res mono monitor will function this way However, you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI RES jumper located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM SIMM selects and Ethernet connection and be happily on your way When you pull the motherboard, the jumpers are in the left rear e g north west quadrant of the motherboard to the left of the SIMM sockets Thad Floryan , ,
