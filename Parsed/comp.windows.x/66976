From David Rex Wood Subject Creating application contexts multiple times The subject does not describe the problem I am having very Please read I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget displays the widget for a while then destroys everything and The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including depending on which calls I make to get rid of things Core Dump BadPixmap X Error Widget not unmapped Here is a simple C program I wrote to show the problem include include Xm include Xm void bla XtAppContext app Display dis XOpenDisplay int junk Widget top XtAppInitialize app test NULL junk NULL NULL NULL Widget box XtVaCreateManagedWidget blaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass top XmNheight XmNwidth NULL XtRealizeWidget top Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only XEvents for int i i i XEvent event XtAppNextEvent app event XtDispatchEvent event WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE XtUnrealizeWidget top XtDestroyWidget top XtDestroyApplicationContext app XCloseDisplay dis main for int i i i bla Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time in this example after XEvents the function will exit and return to the main With this example I get the following error on about this is NOT consistent the call to bla X Error of failed request BadPixmap invalid Pixmap parameter Major opcode of failed request X CreateGC Resource id in failed request Serial number of failed request Current serial number in output stream If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget top line it just dumps core on the seconds Furthermore every time I call XtAppInitialize other than the time I get Warning Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning Initializing Translation manager So finally my question is this What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times Any help would be greatly PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this Thanks very davewood David Rex Wood University of Colorado at Boulder
