From Jesse W Asher Subject Xw widget set ported to X R I'm trying to compile xftp which uses the Xw widget set and I'm having problems We're using Motif and X R and it seems that my version of the Xw stuff was only ported to R Are there patches out to port this to R or a newer port altogether Or perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with R Thanks in advance Jesse W Asher Varco Pruden Buildings Poplar Ave , Suite , Memphis, TN Internet UUCP vpbuild jessea
