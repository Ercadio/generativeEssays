From mike Michael Chapman Subject Compiling help I'd like to compile on a Sony NWS running NEWS The X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the BUT also in the release notes nothing from Sony is listed under the supported What am I supposed to use for my X server then How can the OS be supported but not the hardware Is there something in the binaries that can be used as the server These may seem like silly questions but I'm really I will NOT raise taxes on the middle Unknown
