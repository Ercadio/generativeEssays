From mike hopper Virginia EDU Michael Chapman Subject Compiling help I'd like to compile X r on a Sony NWS running NEWS c The X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine BUT, also in the release notes, nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers What am I supposed to use for my r X server then How can the OS be supported, but not the hardware Is there something in the r binaries that can be used as the r server These may seem like silly questions, but I'm really confused I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class Unknown
