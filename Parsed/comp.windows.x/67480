From Gary Rich Subject Re DESQview X on a PC and network Traffic In article writes In article Technical Support writes In article writes What sort of traffic is generated with the X calls I am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running DV X is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response Anyone have any ideas I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network To give you a real world example here at Quarterdeck we have roughly people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each It's not too much of a load on our Ethernet with maybe concentrators so you have people on each segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some But the biggest problem would be the machine Say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network If you have people running programs off it you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on effectively a MHz Of course DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have working programs running you'll know Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after The link I want to use though ISDN is costly and the bandwidth That's why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group I'll take the liberty of responding to some of If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to A line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the ethernet that we typically How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link useless for anyone On the other hand probably xclocks quietly updating every seconds or so wouldn't impact it too In the real world you will be somewhere in between these two Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldn't want to have to share that link with more than other Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all Are you running any standard MS Windows programs like Word What sort of packets go blazing through What size link do you have or What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points Our corporate WAN is as unique as any The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client server database remotely from the DVX machine behind Since the server end is or was always at this end California it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the As I warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a ISDN Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage Let's break it into pieces and look at Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network If no backing store then what was being covered up If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite If it was a full color backdrop of Ren Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be Assuning a screen with bits per pixel that's bits that has to be Worst possible case you're looking at about In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X It all really depends on what the programs are doing you're going to see a slowdown from X bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things What do you mean by network things I vision using MS Windows and other Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all I am getting are the I am wondering how good is the X and subsequently DV X protocol in transferring these images with X calls and displaying them on a client's X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a It's pretty good for X programs are best DOS text programs are almost as good since we conert them to X easily Something like WinX is a We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell Quarterdeck Office Systems Gary Rich Problem Resolution Anonymous FTP site
