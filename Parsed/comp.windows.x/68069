From David Tan Box Baker Lab Subject Ignorant Imake xfig question Hi folks I'm trying to compile xfig on a running SunOS and OW and I'm having a little trouble with make Specifically make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw This isn't surprising since files on Suns with the standard OW distribution are in various places under usr openwin Xaw files are in usr openwin share include Xaw Actually the real problem is that I know squat about imake and I don't know how to tell imake where the files I can see from the Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places but the first line of the Makefile reads Makefile generated by imake do not edit Help Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to look I have set DEFINES DOPENWIN BUG as it said to in the README Email and post are both Thanks in advance Dave
