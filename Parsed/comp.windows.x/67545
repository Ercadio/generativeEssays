From Henry Stilmack JAC Hawaii SysMgr Subject Help building XView on SPARC Classic Can anyone help with this System SPARC Classic, Solaris , gcc , X R When I try to build the XView libraries xview , patched with the patch from the X R Solaris kit , I get the following error rm f ndet loop o shared ndet loop o gcc fpcc struct return E O I build include I usr X R include DSVR DSYSV DFUNCPROTO DOS
