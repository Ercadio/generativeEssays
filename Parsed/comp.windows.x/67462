From Duncan Sinclair Subject Glasgow RX remote execution of X programs, Part I posted this a few weeks back, but all I got back was an error message pnews dev null Permission denied Yep, dev null had a mode of Arrghhh With renewed interest in setting the DISPLAY variable , etc I thought I would post my contribution This Perl script is my solution It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able to type rx host domain etc , and get a xterm running on host domain etc , with all the difficult stuff taken care of In theory, this program can do everything you ever wanted to do when you wanted to run a remote command in the background it doesn't even need to be an X program Try a rx big machine make for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote big machine For more details and a full list of features read the README file, about lines below All comments welcome Duncan bin sh This is a shell archive Remove anything before this line, then unpack it by saving it into a file and typing sh file To overwrite existing files, type sh file c You can also feed this as standard input via unshar, or by typing sh file , e g If this archive is complete, you will see

Sinclair X XTrivial to install, but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial X XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed, just Xedit the rx pl file, and read the

it to remacs to get a remote X emacs command X X Automatic xterm options names the xterm according to hostname, X and turns on login shell X X Default command is xterm X X Propagates X ish env

March X Version X SH NAME Xrx,rxterm,r remote command, xterm, anything execution X SH SYNOPSIS X B rx X X B l X I username X X I host X X I command X X br X B rxterm X X B l X I username X X I host X X IR args X X SH DESCRIPTION XThe X B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X I host Xand executes the specified X I command Xin the background, returning immediately To allow the execution Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session If you omit X IR command , Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host The X B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes X I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments X PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine X PP XIf the name of the file from which X B rx Xis executed is anything other than rx,'' X B rx Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading r'' as the command Xto run on the remote host, using any X I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command X PP XIf X B rx Xthinks you are using X B xauth Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off site host, or Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account Otherwise it will try to use X B xhost Xto grant access to the remote host X SH OPTIONS X TP X BI l username XUse X I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username In the absence Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username X X SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR, XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD LIBRARY PATH, Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off site, in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV X PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed X SH DIAGNOSTICS X TP X IB command don't recognise my name X B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under In this case Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal X TP X B rx usage rx l username hostname args XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it X SH AUTHOR XDuncan Sinclair , July X br XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the X B gwm Xdistribution To distinguish this rx from other programs Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the X B Glasgow X BR rx X SH SEE ALSO XX , rsh , xterm , xauth , xhost , gwm X SH BUGS X B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used Xor not X PP XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell, X B sh Xthen strange things are more likely to happen Especially when Xit's only one of them X PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up X PP XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in X B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it X PP XWhen X B rx Xuses X B xhost Xto grant access, the X B xhost Xcommand may fail silently X PP XIf X B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh If this happens, you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment END OF FILE if test ne wc c 'rx man' then echo shar 'rx man'

usr local bin perl X CONFIG change the line above to point to your copy of perl X X Glasgow RX version X X Copyright Duncan Sinclair X X Last Modified Early April X X Distribution limited, as per the usual MIT copyright X X remote execution of X programs Based on a script in an old version of gwm X X To install, put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it X Some configuration will be necessary, see CONFIG comments X X More and more this is less and less like the original X X Major hacked to work for our my set up, and also partly X re written to work with sh, rather than ksh X X Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script X X Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point big improvement X X This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works This means there X are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in X These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use, and in my X environment At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible X about the remote machine Here's a list of all the more tricky ones X That the remote machine has csh Linux X That RSHELL bin k sh remote shell bin k sh Make same X If remote shell sh, that PATH is compatible Use csh, etc X I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be, but does it X know what to do with a cookie eat it X There must be others X X Why am I using csh to run the remote commands Simply because it doesn't X interact badly with rsh, and hang waiting for a file descriptor to X be closed I'd rather use zsh, or bash, or even perl, but they are not X as universal as csh X X Xrequire stat pl X X What we called X X argv X argv s X X CONFIG X Change these variables to be your domain name, and a pattern that X will match all variations on your domain name You must include X those leading dots If your hostname includes your domain, see X the code further down, marked XXX X X DOM dcs gla ac uk X DOMPAT dcs gla sgow ac uk X X CONFIG X Change this to your value of
