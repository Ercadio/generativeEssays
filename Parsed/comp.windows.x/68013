From Jeffrey Weber Subject XView SUN XGL performance problem I've written an application for SparcStation GX under OpenWindows The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the The application does real time D animation but it does not update the the display fast I'm using notify set itimer XView call to periodically kick off my update routine and it's not happening fast I want it to update times It's only doing about Also it appears to be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even Any ideas
