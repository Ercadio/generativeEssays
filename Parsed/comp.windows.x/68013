From Jeffrey S Weber Subject XView, SUN XGL, performance problem I've written an application for SparcStation GX , under OpenWindows The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas The application does real time D animation, but it does not update the the display fast enough I'm using notify set itimer XView call to periodically kick off my update routine, and it's not happening fast enough I want it to update times second It's only doing about Also, it appears to be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is up, the update rate slows down even more Any ideas Thanks
