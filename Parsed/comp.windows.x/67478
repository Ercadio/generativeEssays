From MIL Subject xdm and env vars Hi, I am using xdm on X R with OW and Xview on Sun s and SPARCs running SunOS Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment variables like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc in my login file With xdm, the login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root window nor my applications know about these variables I used the DisplayManager userPath resource in usr lib X xdm xdm config to succesfully pass the PATH variable But I am having problems passing anything else I tried execing HOME login in usr lib X xdm Xsession but that didn't help I also tried using DisplayManager exportList HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH which didn't work either I would appreciate any help on this matter Thanks in advance, Shash Shash Chatterjee EMAIL EC Software PHONE Lockheed Fort Worth Company FAX P O Box , MZ Ft Worth, TX
