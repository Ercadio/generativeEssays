From Me Subject Vanishing font A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS When he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager In this configuration X windows applications particularly xdvi work However if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error Unable to load ISO The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file with prettier colours and other slight Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either If I start the xterm with a different font using the fn option no It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its Note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories hash Other than rewriting the XTerm app defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas More info This is the most recent MIPS workstation I believe with the most current operating system and running It is not mwm's fault as the same problems occur under twm
