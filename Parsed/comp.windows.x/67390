From Vaughan Clarkson Subject Connecting a digitiser to X REPOST Hi there I posted this to but got no response so I'm posting I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation an HP It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser However this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the usr lib X devices file display number I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert dev as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to But maybe I'm Am I What I would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X rather than just as input to a specific X application If so what were the steps required for installation Did you need a special device driver Did the manufacturer supply it Are there generic public domain device drivers around I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard Any help would be greatly Cheers Vaughan Vaughan Clarkson Email Engineering Student Phone Glider Pilot Fax
