From Leslie Henne Subject Re ideas on xterm paste irritation In writes Moving the mouse out of the xterm window before clicking up will not abort the In fact once that middle button is pressed down the paste is So the obvious Is there some way around this And do others feel that moving the mouse out of an xterm window before release should abort the paste I would have thought this would have been a common enough problem that someone would have changed xterm by now but maybe it's just Michael It is not just I have been aggravated many times by the mouse making hay of my maladroitness and would be ever grateful to everyone who would make keyboard alternatives for ALL mouse lsrh
