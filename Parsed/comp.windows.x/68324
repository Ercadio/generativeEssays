From EDU Leslie R Henne Subject Re ideas on xterm paste irritation In C u q D D deshaw com , writes Moving the mouse out of the xterm window before clicking up will not abort the paste In fact, once that middle button is pressed down, the paste is inevitable So, the obvious questions Is there some way around this And, do others feel that moving the mouse out of an xterm window before release should abort the paste I would have thought this would have been a common enough problem that someone would have changed xterm by now, but maybe it's just me Michael It is not just you I have been aggravated many times by the mouse making hay of my maladroitness, and would be ever grateful to everyone who would make keyboard alternatives for ALL mouse actions lsrh
