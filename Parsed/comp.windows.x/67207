From rps Ralph Seguin Subject NumLock masking interference with Meta Compose ExtendChar My question is this Is there a means of determining what the state of CapsLock and or NumLock is Ignore I have delved a bit deeper XKeyEvent and found what I was looking ev state has a bunch of masks to check against LockMask is the one for CapsLock Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta eg SGI's vendor server has being NumLock whereas Solaris OpenWindows has for Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling Thanks Ralph
