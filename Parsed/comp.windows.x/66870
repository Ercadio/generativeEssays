From Ken Whaley Subject Re XCopyPlane Question I am trying to use XCopyPlane to copy a single plane from a depth pixmap to a depth Everytime I try this I see absolutely nothing I know there is data in the depth pixmap becuase I have checked by doing an XCopyArea to the I have been successful getting XCopyPlane to work if I use two pixmaps of depth Is there a problem with what I am trying to do Could someone please scan my code segment and let me know where I am going I have created a XmDrawingArea widget called w id XtWindow canvas display XtDisplay canvas screen DefaultScreen display XCreatePixmap display RootWindow display screen w width w height DefaultDepth display screen XCreatePixmap display RootWindow display screen w width w height w XCreateGC display w id NULL w XCreateGC display NULL Code to read xwd image into is omitted Have you set the foreground and background colors in w to something other than and The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros on your server may not return values suitable for depth Copy one plane into the depth pixmap XCopyPlane display w w width w height Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same You could have different pixel values in the image but the fifth plane might all be the same value Using the depth pixmap as the clipmask copy it to the screen fg color x origin y origin mask mask GCForeground GCClipMask XChangeGC display w mask values XFillRectangle display w id w w width w height If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance don't use ClipMasks just use as the stipple in a stippled rectangle Many servers are very stupid about handling complex clip lists and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of little clipping rectangles and clips every drawing primitive against every one of these little Actually I must also ask the FAQ's most popular reason why graphics don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your rectangle Other Info Patchlevel Motif Sun running SunOS Thanks in Advance Nancie Marin NET ENSCO MAIL Pineda Melbourne FAX Kenneth Whaley Kubota Pacific Computer Email Walsh Avenue Santa Clara
