From Ken Whaley Subject Re XCopyPlane Question I am trying to use XCopyPlane to copy a single plane from a depth pixmap to a depth pixmap Everytime I try this, I see absolutely nothing displayed I know there is data in the depth pixmap becuase I have checked by doing an XCopyArea to the screen I have been successful getting XCopyPlane to work if I use two pixmaps of depth Is there a problem with what I am trying to do Could someone please scan my code segment and let me know where I am going wrong I have created a XmDrawingArea widget called canvas w id XtWindow canvas display XtDisplay canvas screen DefaultScreen display pixmap XCreatePixmap display, RootWindow display, screen , w width, w height, DefaultDepth display, screen pixmap XCreatePixmap display, RootWindow display, screen , w width, w height, w gc XCreateGC display, w id, , NULL w gc XCreateGC display, pixmap , , NULL Code to read xwd image into pixmap is omitted Have you set the foreground and background colors in w gc to something other than and The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros on your server may not return values suitable for depth drawables Copy one plane into the depth pixmap XCopyPlane display, pixmap , pixmap , w gc , , , w width, w height, , , Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same You could have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane x might all be the same value Using the depth pixmap as the clipmask, copy it to the screen values foreground fg color values clip x origin values clip y origin values clip mask pixmap mask GCForeground GCClipMask XChangeGC display, w gc , mask, values XFillRectangle display, w id, w gc , , , w width, w height If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance, don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap as the stipple in a stippled rectangle fill Many servers are very stupid about handling complex clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every one of these little triangles Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's most popular reason why graphics don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your rectangle Other Info X R Patchlevel Motif Sun Sparc running SunOS Thanks in Advance Nancie P Marin NET ENSCO Inc MAIL Pineda Ct Melbourne, Fl FAX Kenneth Whaley Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc Email Walsh Avenue Santa Clara, CA
