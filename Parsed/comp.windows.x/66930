From Ken Lee Subject Re XCopyPlane Question In article AA neko CSS GOV, nancie neko CSS GOV Nancie P Marin writes I am trying to use XCopyPlane to copy a single plane from a depth pixmap to a depth pixmap Everytime I try this, I see absolutely nothing displayed I know there is data in the depth pixmap becuase I have checked by doing an XCopyArea to the screen The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid Just because something appears in an bit deep pixmap doesn't mean every bit plane contains data Did you try each plane Ken Lee,
