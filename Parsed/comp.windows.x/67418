From Karsten Spang Subject Re Cannot create plane window summary In article A , Karsten Spang writes I have a problem I am not able to create a window with bit planes gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual But the visual was correctly matched I got several answers, the most complete was from Errol Crary Tek com I have just looked at the R server listings mit server dix window c and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error, even though my O'Reilly book only says BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly if class InputOnly bw depth Find out if the depth and visual are acceptable for this Screen if vmask CWBorderPixmap CWBorderPixel class InputOnly depth pParent drawable depth if vmask CWColormap class InputOnly visual ancwopt visual ancwopt colormap None So, case is InputOnly which is not your case it seems to be the O'Reilly case Case should not be the case since you got the visual for the screen Case looks suspicious you are giving no CWBorder in the attribute mask, and since the visual is not the parent depth, I would suspect you need to supply a border pixel from the new colormap you are going to use for this window Case does not seem to be the problem since you do supply the CWColormap in the attributes Thanks for your help Karsten InterNet Karsten Spang Phone Kampsax Data Fax P O Box DK Hvidovre Denmark
