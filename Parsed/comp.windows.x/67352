From Matt Landau Subject Looking for updated XView textedit source w d n d support The XView version source distribution included in the contrib section of included the source to the textedit I'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk like message server and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it since the Sun supplied textedit binary doesn't seem to speak However the sources in the contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows For example the OWN textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area while the source in contrib xview knows nothing about drag and The included in the xview sources says it's version dated while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN binary says Copyr Sun Micro Copyr Sun Micro Copyr Sun Micro ds Copyr Sun Micro So does anyone know if the sources to textedit are available I'd really like to work from the latest source if Please reply by email and I'll post a summary if there's enough Matt Landau Waiting for a flash of enlightenment in all this blood and thunder
