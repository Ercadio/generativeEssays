from ethan solomita subject desqview x over tcp ip how reliable how is it implemented three q's is it reliable? 2) how does it send the information from a ms windows app over
the x11 protocol? does it just draw everything as graphics into
one window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
more cleverly? 3) if i want to run ms word, for example, remotely, do i have to
run a separate copy of ms windows remotely, and then start ms
word from that, or can ms word be started remotely on its own? thanks a lot! -- ethan
