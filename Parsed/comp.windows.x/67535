From Ethan Solomita Subject Desqview X over TCP IP how reliable how is it implemented Three q's is it reliable how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over the protocol Does it just draw everything as graphics into one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly If I want to run MS Word for example remotely do I have to run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely and then start MS Word from that or can MS Word be started remotely on its own Thanks a lot Ethan
