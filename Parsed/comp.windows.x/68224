From Joe Hildebrand Subject Re Help needed callbacks actions and events I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets callbacks and actions The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a I want to connect this to a No problem so I could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events But because the drawing takes some while I want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by Then I want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was It seems to me that this isn't possible but how can I give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed Use a See XtAppAddWorkProc You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks this is the hard part Then in the callback that starts the drawing you call XtAppAddWorkProc to call your workProc the first Your workProc should be a function that returns a TRUE when you are finished and FALSE when you want to keep If you return FALSE the workProc is automatically re Note that this method is better that using a time out loop since events get processed in a more precedence oriented If you are using the same Ada bindings I am however you are hosed and should look into XtAppAddTimeout Joe Hildebrand Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts Standard disclaimers apply
