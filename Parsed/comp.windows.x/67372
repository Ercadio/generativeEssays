From Darcy McCallum Subject Keyboard mapping and window placement questions These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup I would like to do it the second way but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping a MappingNotify event is generated non maskable which I can pick up and modify my internal But I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses If I use Xt all O'Reilly has to say is ' automatically handled by ' If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent I get This all stems from problems with users of the Sun keyboard and the NumLock plus various Alt Meta modifier I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main I want it at the same y coord and their right left sides What I need to ask for is the x y coord of the window manager's border for the main This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget immediately checking the x y after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the x y and seeing that it is now offset by the WM Any help would be most Darcy
