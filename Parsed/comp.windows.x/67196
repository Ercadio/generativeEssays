From toml Tom LaStrange Subject Re REPOST Accelerators Translations In article Trevor Bourget ignite writes In writes I posted this a while ago and didn't receive one reply and now we have another bug report on the same Can anybody help me out The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators and these grabs are specific about which modifiers Unfortunately the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case Ctrl Any Key q In ORA in the section on accelerators it says For information on how to specify translation tables see this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator If you go to it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as For example the translation Shift Key q quit will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key and the q key This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs it's not true for menu If you're a Motif implementor I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described Otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as Is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry If you mean menu accelerator no it's not That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators I can't think of a reason why How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case What I want is Ctrl O and Ctrl o to both be accelerators on one menu I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators I would have one resource called accelerators that took a translation table I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators As soon as the end user specified one it would be active and automatically To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like override n Ctrl Key M fire n Shift Key L fire n The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a Ctrl M show up in your menuItem Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with There has to be some Sorry for the political tone of this Tom LaStrange toml
