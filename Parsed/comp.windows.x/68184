From Robert Ross Subject Detecting Saving Geometry Changes Hi I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize position events so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell XtAddEventHandler topLevel StructureNotifyMask False configureCB myData This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager mwm However when I'm just resizing the window using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler I'm accessing the xconfigure structure like the manual xev xev The width and height memebers are When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x y width height member Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes I've tried using XtGetValues on the topLevel widget when exiting my application before destroying any widgets and all I get is garbage values for the x y width height Thanks Bob Ross Plow that's the That name Loral Instrumentation San Diego CA again is Plow Homer Simpson
