From baileyc Christopher Bailey Subject How do I cause a timeout I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's get value I am pretty sure this is happening because I am not using XtAppMainLoop but am dealing with events via ya ya Anyway I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget s will call their get value Or if someone knows another FAST way around this or any way for that matter let me I cannot or I don't think call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc XtPointer call data In other words I want to force a strip chart widget to update Any ideas anyone Christopher Bailey Internet University of Colorado at Boulder CompuServe Ride Fast Take Chances
