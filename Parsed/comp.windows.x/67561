From Thomas Richard S Thomas Stevenson Subject XCOMM in Imakefile files I've installed many X apps and have that many of them Imakefiles that have lines startingwith XCOMM in When I do a xmkmf to create the Makefile the Makefile also has the XCOMM comment lines in I always have to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on I was wondering what these lines were for and what I might be doing wrong that causes the make command to dislike Thanks
