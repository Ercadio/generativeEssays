From Robert Brodersen Subject Resolution bitmapped fonts device I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing usr lib xdm Xservers from local usr bin X dpi to local usr bin X dpi I determined that my monitor was dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by However this has caused my application fonts to behave After some research I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying Since I have only and fonts on my path the results are I do have some Speedo fonts but not for the family I am using Helvetica I think this is The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts For instance the command xfd fn ' bitstream charter ' Will invoke a font despite the fact that this is a Speedo font The command xfd fn ' adobe courier ' Will invoke a font or a font depending on my font path Despite the fact that X knows my display is dpi and that it can generate an font for me Unless I my applications specifies a resolution X appears to pick a stupid Is this a bug Is it a feature If so why Is there anything I can do to get around this problem People have suggested that I lie about my resolution and specify a single font path or not both This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say Yup thats an inch Anyone have a set of bitmapped fonts I can use System info Sun Sparc w MB SunOS xdpyinfo version number vendor string MIT X Consortium vendor release number screen dimensions pixels millimeters resolution dots per inch xset q font path usr lib fonts misc usr lib fonts Speedo usr lib fonts usr lib fonts Thanks Bob Brodersen Applications Architect Applications Technology Group Applications Division Oracle Corporation Redwood Shores CA
