From Robert Brodersen Subject Resolution, bitmapped fonts, device independence I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing usr lib X xdm Xservers from local usr bin X X ar dpi to local usr bin X X ar dpi I determined that my x monitor was dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it Since I have only dpi and dpi fonts on my path, the results are inaccurate I do have some Speedo fonts, but not for the family I am using Helvetica I think this is incorrect The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts For instance, the command xfd fn ' bitstream charter ' Will invoke a dpi font despite the fact that this is a Speedo font The command xfd fn ' adobe courier ' Will invoke a dpi font or a dpi font depending on my font path Despite the fact that X knows my display is dpi, and that it can generate an dpi font for me Unless I my applications specifies a resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default Is this a bug Is it a feature If so, why Is there anything I can do to get around this problem People have suggested that I lie about my resolution, and specify a single font path or , not both This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say Yup, thats an inch Anyone have a set of dpi bitmapped fonts I can use System info Sun Sparc w MB, SunOS xdpyinfo version number vendor string MIT X Consortium vendor release number screen dimensions x pixels x millimeters resolution x dots per inch xset q font path usr lib X fonts misc , usr lib X fonts Speedo , usr lib X fonts dpi , usr lib X fonts dpi Thanks Bob Brodersen Applications Architect, Applications Technology Group, Applications Division Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, CA
