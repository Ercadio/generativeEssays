From tgl Tom Lane Subject Re XV has escaped Chris Sherman gripes It really bums me out that xv went xv's been shareware for about a year hadn't you noticed I don't have a problem with John Bradley has put a hell of a lot of work into xv and if he feels that it's time to get some monetary reward from it that's surely his Can the author legally sell xv Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed by Did the author get permission to sell these works Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG code which are right there in the xv distribution you would have observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants permission for unrestricted use including My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product Commercial There's a big difference between a polite request for a voluntary donation and commercial it's illegal to copy this and we'll sic our lawyers on you I do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about what he means by personal regards tom lane organizer Independent JPEG Group
