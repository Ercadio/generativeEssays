From Michael Turok Subject 'makedepend' problem Hi netters We have a problem with 'makedepend' it doesn't know how to correctly process if clause in C preprocessor It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals For example makedepend chokes on one of include files as distributed by Sun namely if defined defined STDC include define index strchr define rindex strrchr else BSD STDC include endif STDC Here 'makedepend' evaluates both if and corresponding else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file which doesn't exist under We also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy We got and built 'makedepend' off the net it didn't fix the In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man page Sun's distribution mentions this problem BUGS If you do not have the source for cpp the Berkeley C preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all if directives will evaluate to true regardless of their actual This may cause the wrong include directives to be Makedepend should simply have its own parser written for if Has anybody come up with some solution fix to 'makdepend' other than and willing to share it with us Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed please reply directly to my e mail address I'll post a Thanks in Michael Turok Information Resources E Mail Fifth Avenue Voice Waltham MA USA Fax
