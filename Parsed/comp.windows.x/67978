From Blue Subject Some rookie questions Im new to Xlib Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me I create a window and I want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in Further when I resize the window I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window whether it is larger or Im using AIXwindows on an My problem is this when I resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn Everything else is a oval tries to redraw itself but gets I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when For example I start out the window at in width and If I resize it to the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to rest is Further the oval only shows up in that What am I doing wrong How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window Second question Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are Thanks Chris
