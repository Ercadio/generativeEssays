from jon herlocker subject how to access bit color on cg we have a sun and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card. the cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual.
the default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to
the 24-bit visual. we have tried using xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no
success. xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome. there are two possible solutions: if someone has patches for x11r5 xsun server, could they forward them to us? otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows?
