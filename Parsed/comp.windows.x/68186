from boyd gauss mickey boyd subject re dump x window screen h j hong wrote hi i'm looking for a tool to dump a x-window screen image?
> any one can help me ? see xwd, xpr. even better, grab xdump from ftp.cs.uwm.edu. it makes use of these programs as well, but has a much nicer interface (and can do more).
you can dump to postscript, bitmaps, etc. --
