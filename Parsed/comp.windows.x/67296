From Derek C Richardson Subject Allocated colors Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells allocated in the default colormap e g colormap DefaultColormap mydisplay, myscreen The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells mydisplay, myscreen , but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be much less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows currently in place I'd like a way to determine this number Thanks in advance Derek Derek C Richardson Tel x Institute of Astronomy Fax Cambridge, U K CB HA E mail
