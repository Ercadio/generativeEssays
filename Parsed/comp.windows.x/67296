From Derek Richardson Subject Allocated Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells allocated in the default colormap colormap DefaultColormap mydisplay myscreen The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells mydisplay myscreen but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be much less than this depending on the color requirements of the windows currently in I'd like a way to determine this Thanks in advance Derek Derek Richardson Tel x Institute of Astronomy Fax Cambridge E mail
