From Liam Quin Subject OPEN LOOK GUI frequently asked questions Frequently asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User If your question isn't here please try at least man openwin man xnews man xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below before posting to the look or newsgroups and or their corresponding mailing Special Notes I have not updated this FAQ for the recently announced OpenWindows due to ship later this Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features Yes OpenWindows will use DPS instead of NeWS is This means TNT is dead XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next I don't know if there will be a source release of XView or The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet ported to Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at Yes the new Mailtool will be MIME Frequently Asked Questions for are posted to This

Interface GUI A GUI determines the look and feel' of a system the shape of windows buttons and scroll bars how you resize things how you edit files The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT T or USL See Also Bibliography What is OpenWindows OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface It's compatible with the window system from MIT as well as currently Sun's NeWS and SunView so you can intermix programs written for any of those It comes from Sun and also with System V Release from certain OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the program used to start it and the main executable itself It should not be called Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or OpenLook' as these terms are either wrong or apply to something A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about for the server plus about for DeskSet and another for The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are SunOS on Sun Solaris SunOS on SPARC Solaris SunOS on SPARC See Also Mixing and OpenWindows Where can I get it What are OLIT XView and TNT These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual Here's a brief summary OLIT was AT T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already Xt programmers to You could buy the source from AT T although you didn't get the same version tht Sun Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows it is also often included in System V Release It was written in The release of OLIT in OpenWindows was OLIT OLIT support passed to USL then a division of AT T now owned by Novell who replaced it with MoOLIT Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses see the proceedings of the X Technical Conference XView is Sun's toolkit for written in XView is similar in programmer interface to There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is available by anonymous ftp from and elsewhere The current version of XView from Sun is Despite rumours to the contrary some even from within Sun the XView toolkit is NOT about to be dropped by XView will be included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as The NeWS Toolkit TNT was an object oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an It's currently included in The current version of TNT from Sun is Release contains some incompatibilities with tNt' and TNT but Sun are committed to supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display You might ask what is committed to' means in this context the answer seems to be that it means absolutely Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT The C User Interface Toolkit UIT consists of an object oriented C class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide GIL The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows and and presumably since the release mentions that it works on Solaris UIT is not an official Sun supported product but an ongoing project of various people within It can be found on in the MIT contrib directory as use binary mode Where does Motif fit in It doesn't Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by It has a look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS Presentation There are no non commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because Sun and have such a large installed Sun's CD WARE Volume contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT there are also notes in the Periodic Table' OLIT demo OPENWINHOME demo What is MoOLIT MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT T USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run It will be part of System V Release Contact Joanne Newbauer What about that Display PostScript thing Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use as I understand The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less complete DPS is also available on more kinds of Performance on our RS is not suitable for interactive work what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be Note that whereas X NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS extension to X does not make Type PostScript fonts available to ordinary It is not like ATM on a PC in this there is at least one third party version which does make fonts available however Subject Window Managers olwm olvwm What are olwm and olvwm They are window A window manager is the part of the X Window system that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user's interaction with the Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window It's included with all of the OpenWindows implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop' hence the v' in its name It shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow This lets you run several clients applications and move the display around from one to the Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows olwm by Scott Oaks you need to have XView to compile Get olvwm from an ftp site such as in the contrib directory there are three patches Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm If you use twm for example or mwm you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you probably won't see the footers some windows use to display certain If you use twm you'll want to use the function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a quit' button when not run under For twm put this in your HOME LeftTitleButton target where target is a icon from usr include Alternatively try Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton menu menu Quit For mwm you can double click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop up window I am told See the manual page for your window manager twm etc Subject OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS PostScript and This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support and thus won't run on an X This includes pageview in You can use olwm or olvwm see above on an X terminal or a non Open Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients OLIT or XView ones will work perfectly You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being If so see the Fonts section If you are running the window manager built in to an NCD terminal you may have problems with input focus setting Input True in the terminal's XDefault file in usr lib xdm may or may not Subject Configuration Files Getting started with OpenWindows What configuration files do I need to know about and The first time you run OpenWindows a file will be created in your login directory HOME If it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat it's simplest to move it and any other old files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new If your site uses xdm you should use instead of since xdm doesn't look at your init menu and sys These are optional files you can create in your HOME directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you Look in OPENWINHOME lib normally usr openwin lib for these files without the leading and copy any you want to You may need to edit your to get them If you are not on an X terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool C shelltool C xterm C or Chuck Musciano's contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your Note that sys is not executed unless you edit You can put X Windows resource specifications in In particular it is a good idea to include at least true Input TRUE These allow non ICCCM compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for Props the program that runs when you select properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into Don't put comments in since props' deletes This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows actually xnews on This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and WARNING things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows and Note that the mouse speed is best set in your with xset m see the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more Here's what HOME should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second microseconds and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second microseconds between repeats for OpenWindows You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn't include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my than on your SuperSPARC GTi injection Again this is for OpenWindows don't want the demos see xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual IncludeDemos false def UserProfile begin KeyRepeatThresh timeval storetimeval def KeyRepeatTime timeval storetimeval def Note and differ end You must also have a file in the same directory like this NeWS findpackage beginpackage TNTCore findpackage beginpackage TNT findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop force to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this psh i Welcome to NeWS psh i Welcome to NeWS classinit ClassRepeatKeys send now press control D You can also either of these two files and to make the root window be retained so that a PostScript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows frambuffer Retained true put will do Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server xnews See also Trouble Shooting It Won't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults Environment Variables How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left handed mouse and keyboard You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one or two occasional See also man xview for a list of keybindings you can change at least for XView With OpenWindows you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not put this in your if eval svenv env then xmodmap e pointer input from defaults else xmodmap e pointer fi How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle Run screenblank from etc if you can it's a boring but effective screen See man screenblank' Under Solaris you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system as it's not Then add a new file in etc to make the system run screenblank Subject Key Bindings Cut and Paste How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs To go from XTerm to textedit say Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm Press COPY in the XTerm this key is or Meta c the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong Move to the textedit window and press PASTE or Meta v If this doesn't work see Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste To go the other way from textedit to XTerm Select the text in No need to use COPY Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST the middle mouse button You can also use the COPY CUT and PASTE COPY PASTE is What short cuts are available Quick Copy within textedit mailtool etc Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE or CUT button Select the text you want to copy You'll see that it's underlined or crossed out as In the jed demo it goes grey Let go of the PASTE or CUT The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert Drag and Drop to Move a Selection Select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right you'll see the cursor changes to be the first letters of the text or some other icon Still holding SELECT down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle sight or target to show that it's OK to drop things here Let go of SELECT and the text is This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere See the man page for textedit for some of In general the editing moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted Ctrl w deletes a word and Ctrl W deletes the word to the right of the insert Meta i include file Meta f find selection forward backward Ctrl a start of line Ctrl back word Ctrl e end of line Ctrl forward word Ctrl w delete word Ctrl u delete to start END of line Ctrl Return move to end START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys see also the olwm or olvwm manual What can I put in my Where is it documented See the manual page for Subject Applications Finding Contact SunSoft or Sun and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide which lists over pages of applications and also the huge Catalyst listing of products for Suns updated six Sun's free CDWare CD ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full product SunPICS produces a CD ROM for NeWSPrint users Printer's Pallate which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as well as scaleable fonts that you can There is a separate FAQ posting in look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications mail for a copy including OPEN LOOK UI

PostScript fonts Yes under either Solaris or I'm not sure which Or Not Yet in other If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them I'm The fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted though and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is The font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group listed in the Bibliography Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun You can buy fonts from SunPICS Monotype Linotype URW and probably other major SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer TypeScaler is pretty fast it's not as fast as loading a bitmap You can pre generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache psh i Welcome to NeWS psh will say this at you currentfontmem type this line and here's whai my server was using Kbytes setfontmem Just to check currentfontmem See of the NeWS Programmer's You need to say psh i so that the PostScript packages are loaded see the psh man Making bitmap fonts for faster startup mkdir HOME myfonts cd HOME myfonts makeafb M OPENWINHOME lib fonts Creating convertfont b Chars parameter greater than number of characters ls bldfamily Bembo Encoding latin cat No such file

Converting between font formats convertfont You can also use Folio fonts with an server by converting them to a bitmap bdf format Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for Having said all you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or Use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert TeX pk fonts to bdf format which you can then use with either or You can also use der Mouse's getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running X display server ftp X getbdf Xview OLIT fonts at dpi There aren't More precisely the various text fonts such as Lucida Typewriter Sans are available at dpi and in fact are scalable under The glyph fonts are bitmaps and don't scale very Subject Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages No manual entry for cm lookup If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands even though you are running OpenWindows try setting the MANPATH environment variable MANPATH OPENWINHOME share man usr man export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH OPENWINHOME share man usr man for csh OPENWINHOME should be usr openwin on most window Window creation failed to get new fd window Base frame not passed parent window in environment Cannot create base Process These messages all come from SunView SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns and was not Some of the SunView programs are still around in usr bin and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows You almost certainly want to run the programs in OPENWINHOME Set your path so that OPENWINHOME bin and OPENWIN bin xview for OpenWindows come before bin or usr bin they're the same or you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool memory fault core dumped If you get this from the binder or if binder vanishes suddenly get the following patches Binder Cetables Tooltalk Trouble compiling Xt Xmu or OLIT programs get wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows

workaround is to add u get wmShellWidgetClass u get applicationShellWidgetClass on the link ld or cc o An alternative is to add assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile or even in Subject Trouble Shooting It Won't Let Me Type When I try to type into some programs I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least true Input TRUE in your file as these allow non ICCCM compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for See the next item for editing Subject Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste not working I can't paste from xterm to XView including Sun DeskSet programs Under OpenWindows you need to add the following either to your HOME file or to OPENWINHOME lib app defaults XTerm instead XTerm override Key select set CLIPBOARD n Key insert selection CLIPBOARD You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing the Paste key Under OpenWindows this is already in the app defaults file so if it isn't working check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to usr openwin lib T N S and if it isn't either set it or copy merge the above lines from OPENWINHOME lib app defaults XTerm into usr lib app defaults See also Environment Variables This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard XTerm override n Ctrl Meta insert selection PRIMARY CUT n Ctrl Meta BtnUp select end PRIMARY CUT CLIPBOARD n KeyPress insert selection CLIPBOARD Note be sure that the n is at the very end of the line there must be no following spaces and any or signs showing that this FAQ file was altered must also be removed If you are using you may find that adding the lines Key start extend select end PRIMARY CLIPBOARD CUT n KeyRelease kill selection n before the KeyPress line will make CUT work as a cut key If you alter HOME instead you must use what X calls a more specific' resource name will I can't paste from XView including Sun DeskSet programs to xterm If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard you can use Meta x Meta c and Meta v for cut coy and paste You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your file edited as you wish the values shown here are the defaults c Meta v Meta Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview and also in the thinnish blue book Companion to Volume XView Reference Manual' from O'Reilly and also in the olwm and olvwm manual I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE Meta v Remove the file tmp textsw shelf and see if that helps see also the next Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all OpenWindows only Oh Use ps xuaww grep xv to check that sv xv sel svc is running and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started OpenWindows with openwin or by logging in through If not start If it dies check that there is no tmp xv sel svc before restarting it you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your Check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like tmp if there are several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start a terminal emulator and remove and tmp and tmp Text files that are still It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working again you can just carry Note that files in tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade so don't remove those without checking first Subject Trouble Shooting Not authorized to use display If you get error messages that look like Xlib connection to refused by server Xlib Internal error during connection authorization check Error Can't Open display try on the machine running OpenWindows or xhost machine where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you using your display you will have to type the bizarre looking xhost hostname or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation This lets ANY user on happyboy' access your With OpenWindows you can also use xauth and the Programmer's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter This is more Also check the man page for fbtab to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows under SunOS to fix a serious security It is available through your local Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from system in sun dist Fix PatchID Filename Checksum loadmodule On an X Terminal there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in tmp that are used to communicate with the server when DISPLAY doesn't have a hostname before the or is Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip Subject Trouble Shooting other common problems I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away Sun or If refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm C from your or start one up in the background and then choose Save Workspace from the Workspace Utilities Better still pick up contool and run Get it from in the contrib It will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears it's very easy to If refresh from the Workspace Utilities menu doesn't make the messages go a Sun with a frame buffer has two screens you can move the mouse off the right hand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display called See the page for openwin I have a shell script that checks for this and if there's a dev does openwin dev dev dev dev If you are running or OpenWindows you might need to add this to your or other startup file eval svenv display unix env olvwm display unix Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this You can also run switcher e to get rid of the Also see the note about contool Is there an easy way of editing Use props' which appears in the default root menu as properties' This starts props' a property editor which will re write your after removing It then applies any Keep comments by using instead of for example Palatino Italic How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit set the default editor to sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter FILE you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video This tends not to work under OpenWindows With OpwnWindows there are various ways including using bg and fg If you're using OpenWindows on a Sun probably the best you can do short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC is to use xterm instead of Why don't flat check boxes work A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use A workaround is to edit the Guide output as it's only Guide's output that's broken not the actual check box This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide If you're still using an ancient DevGuide you should upgrade as soon as possible the new one is fantastic When I leave OpenWindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the Try running clear colormap if this helps put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows openwin' When I use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or This was a bug related to some systems The only work round was to use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv or Why have some of my function keys stopped working Keys and changed from and to SunXK and SunXK respectively in OpenWindows Applications must be recompiled or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit I get the Sunview version See under Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages see also next item Mixing and OpenWindows see also next item Note that OpenWindows includes the core distribution to patch level but not the contrib These notes apply to OpenWindows although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows and Install the libraries in usr lib You can intermix OpenWindows and or they're all compatible in this Put the binaries in for example usr bin Put usr bin last in your PATH so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of ones where appropriate although this is a matter of In any event put the OpenWindows bin directory first see the preceding item for more details on If you have bin or usr bin they're the same directory on SunOS earlier in your PATH than OPENWINHOME bin xview you'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones Set LD LIBRARY PATH so that usr openwin lib is last after the library This doesn't matter with OpenWindows but with older versions you'll get error messages from programs if you don't do The messages are generally harmless see next item although xdm core dumps if this isn't Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't usr See Also Environment Variables especially XFILESEARCHPATH I get error messages on my screen about not found set LD LIBRARY PATH to be usr If you also use use usr lib usr usr openwin lib If you put this in a shell script or your use OPENWINHOME usr openwin lib instead of usr openwin

OpenWindows xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass Function keys and stopped working In OpenWindows the names keysyms for these keys was changed to SunXK and SunXK Code which uses them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap e 'keysym SunXK ' Subject Trouble Shooting XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears which has been promised but hasn't reached Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per You should also look at the FAQ in how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items PANEL LIST FONT takes an int row number and an Xv opaque font PANEL LIST FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv opaque font There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL LIST FONT when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function insert row list row string that hides the nasty how do I keep an XView pop up window displayed after a button is pressed In the button callback do xv set button PANEL NOTIFY
