From J M Gerard Subject Re Xterm w ansi color mouse support brown ftms UUCP Vidiot writes In article A writes I've had several requests to post any information I've gathered regarding my search for ansi mouse color xterm source My only response was from Larry W Virden who writes the mit x r and r both provide mouse escape sequences now There are several color xterm enhancements on export lcs mit edu contrib Indeed I found color xterm tar Z in that directory along with lots of other FUN stuff for X Thanks Larry I also found it on uunet in pub window sys X contrib, for those that can only do anonuucp like me But I noticed that the thing is dated , making it over two years old Is this really the latest version Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences as that for VT or colour decterm dxterm I thought that was called colxterm and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or might be my program going wrong I'm also unsure of what is meant by ansi mouse xterm
