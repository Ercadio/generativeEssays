From Paul Prescod Subject X Toolkits I am considering making a reasonably large application for free distribution probably copylefted I am going to use Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of standards that open systems has I've lived in a fairly tookit sheltered Most of the tools here were produced with the Athena Widget set or X Intrinsics or Xw In my humble opinion they look like I don't know however if this is a characteristic of the tookits or just poor aestetic taste in the I would like my app to look a little more sculptured like I understand however that mwm isn't free like the other I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I don't know how it will I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF but I don't know what it looks like If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me I would be much Which are free Which are the best Which are portable Which looks nice Which is not a resource hog Also if you happen to know which are available on Linux and or Sun that would be a big help Thanks in
