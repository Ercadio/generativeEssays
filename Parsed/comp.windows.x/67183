From Rob Earhart earhart Subject Re Animation with XPutImage Derek Richardson writes Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some Is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code mentioned There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the Actually I just finished writing a motif animation take lots of image data and display it pretty darn fast When using on server pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly Testing both methods side by side they were just about The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes but pixmaps can work over a network and are removed if your application dies one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems Ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segments to be attached to a process at once consequently a redraw becomes XShmAttach XShmPutImage XShmDetach on Dec And Dec's bit displays like the ones I tend to use most often don't seem to support the extension maybe someone compiled them wrong and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash failed mallocs so one has to use the local unix domain socket which really isn't that bad one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one In short allowing all three forms of display within the program is a Good Thing minus SHM if running over a network and let the user pick whatever feels I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it Rob
