From Joe Kelsey Subject Re XV has escaped In rmhiuINN George Lindholm writes In article rlhhkINN , George Lindholm writes In article John Bradley writes And here is the first patch The following fixes some problems with the Imakefile files and makes it possible to compile xv under Solaris without having to use the ucb stuff Oops, I didn't get the signal processing right thats what I get from doing the work on an ascii terminal Here is the fixed patch The patches for xv h need to use ifdef SVR '' rather than the overly complex if defined sun defined SYSV '' in order to generically compile XV on i SVR Architecture Also, rand and srand don't work very well use lrand and seed to get better results Otherwise, xv compiles just fine on my Esix System V box with XFree and gcc I just uncommented the gcc definition in the Makefile, added L usr X lib I usr X include to the COPTS line and modified LIBS to include lsocket lnsl Really John, if you just use the Imakefile things like this don't even have to get mentioned xv h , , signal macros ifdef SVR define HOLD SIG sighold SIGALRM define RELEASE SIG sigrelse SIGALRM define PAUSE SIG sigpause SIGALRM else define HOLD SIG sigblock sigmask SIGALRM define RELEASE SIG sigblock define PAUSE SIG sigpause endif default for most folks , , define random rand define srandom srand endif ifdef SVR define random lrand define srandom seed endif
