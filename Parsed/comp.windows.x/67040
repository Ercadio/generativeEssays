From Dale Slone Subject xlock I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo MIPS chip When xlock nolock is running and I am working remotely or in batch at mode the runtime of my programs as timed by using clock in the code itself is slower than if xlock is NOT No other processes seem to affect my runtimes yet this is very consistent Any explanations real or imagined thanx
