From Joel Gringorten Subject Re CURSOR SIZE PROBLEMS In article C Ky L K compsci liverpool ac uk , Mike Bell writes Apologies for those who have read this before but no one has solved this one yet so I'm posting again Sorry I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than x , I'm using Motif X R running HP UX all the functions return valid results but no cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size I tried using the following code unsigned int w,h XQueryBestCursor XtDisplay programArea , XtWindow programArea , , , w, h to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns and as the width and height respectively What am I doing wrong and if not how can I get round the problem Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support Or does the server generate a software cursor You can generally tell the difference just by using it If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity, it's probably a software cursor If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than x It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that In reality you're probably stuck with a x maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns joel
