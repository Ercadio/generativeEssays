From rgooch Richard Gooch Subject Re Animation with XPutImage In article Paul Martz writes In article Derek Richardson writes Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage is considerably slower factor of on average than the Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a This was on a Sparc It seems that the X protocol communication is slowing things down or XPutImage is both Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client server communications mechanism you are Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is much Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running in XSynchonize If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MIT SHM xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which yields over frames per second for bit images running on a Sparc IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for Regards Richard
