From bnoble cs cmu edu Brian Noble Subject X Server scanline padding question I am almost done porting XFree to a new piece of display hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace, so I'm sending a net feeler I have a display that is a non interlaced, memory mapped, bit x display The server's view of the world, obtained via xwd xwud , seems to be exactly what it should be However, the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long After a bit of experimentation, it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is bytes, which isn't exactly divisible by four Changing the following defines in mit server include servermd h define BITMAP SCANLINE PAD define LOG BITMAP PAD define LOG BYTES PER SCANLINE PAD to define BITMAP SCANLINE PAD define LOG BITMAP PAD define LOG BYTES PER SCANLINE PAD Was not exactly the right solution How do I tell the server either a don't pad the scan lines at all 'cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display , or to pad only to byte boundries I'm using a customized version of XFree v , under Mach Thanks Brian
