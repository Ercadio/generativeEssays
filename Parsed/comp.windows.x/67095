From James Cox Subject Xterm Problem With Input Focus Shuffle Up The situation running a Fortran executable that creats an An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics mode Xterm for displaying some Typing a RET while the Tektronics mode Xterm future reference to this will be Tek term is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek term stays on top of If what I'm describing isn't input focus let me The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move the Tek term to the If the Tek term has been iconized to conserve screen space it stays an The desired behavior one of two options Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive Whenever the Tek term is inactivated it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the What I think I need a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify expand a Xterm and Tek These commands would I'd guess need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek Other information All this is taking place on a VT a DEC dumb X windows terminal connected to a VAX running VMS and Thanks for your If you've got any words of wisdom other than give up please send email to jhcox
