From Ken Whaley Subject Re XCopyPlane Question In article Ken Whaley writes Actually I must also ask the FAQ's most popular reason why graphics don't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your rectangle Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the This action clearly should not call XCopyArea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and Do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment came from a simple open draw quit As per your question why not have the button handler add the object and then call the window redraw or whatever directly Although depending on how the overall application is structured there may be no problem with rendering the object directly in response to the button Ken Kenneth Whaley Kubota Pacific Computer Email Walsh Avenue Santa Clara
