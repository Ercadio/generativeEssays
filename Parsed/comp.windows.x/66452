From carlj mugwump Carl Johnson Subject xterm and default text cursor color What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor color to the same as the forground color that is set for that From the man cr color This option specifies the color to use for text cur The default is to use the same foreground color that is used for However this doesnt seem to be the case it appears to default to black or to whatever XTerm cursorColor is set Feel free to point me at the relevant FM or whatever Cheers C
