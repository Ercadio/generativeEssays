From Stephen Kelley Subject vs Configure Event Handling REPOST I have two questions well probably about how Expose Configure events are I have an which uses window to draw Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized I made a translation table for the Expose Configure The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale The rescale method invokes a fake Expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate Expose struct to draw the Quest When the is compiled linked w running in either or I get multiple redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is I assume I'm getting cascading Is that right Any suggestions as to how to handle trap events in a better way Quest When the is compiled linked w I get no Expose events Do events and or translation tables act differently in Thanks in advance Steve Kelley UMCP CS UMIACS Captain I protest I am NOT a merry man Worf
