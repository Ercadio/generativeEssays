From Marc Bouron Subject Re Looking for a file manager under TWM In article M , Thorsten Sommer writes Hi out there Every command line shell favourating user Close your ears, ehm, eyes I'm looking for a X file manager which can be driven under TWM Somebody told me last night, there is one under OpenWindows and there certainly is one under MS Windows But I'd like an X one, you know, with icon's, click and drag, directory structures shown in a graphic layout, a paper basket etc Anybody got an idea I've recently joined the Motif world, so I'd like a similar tool for Motif I've bene used to the OpenWin one in the past and miss it Cheers, M a r c Marc CR Bouron DESISCo Ltd Harefield Place, The Drive, Marc B Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB AQ
