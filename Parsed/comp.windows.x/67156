from daniel drucker subject tape down selections i just had an idea i'm not sure if its been done and i'm just remembering it unconsiously, but i thought that in dialog
boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a
way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
filled in a certain way. my idea: tape. you know, like putting
a piece of tape over a light switch?
just an idea, if you like it, use it. -- daniel drucker n2sxx | forever, forever, my coda. |
