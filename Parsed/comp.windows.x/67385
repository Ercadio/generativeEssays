From Kathy Saint Subject Callback parameter problem after X R upgrade We've just recently upgraded our X to R and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function i e , the w of w, client, call is nil The client and call pointers are okay in some instances, but bogus in other instances We are running SunOS on a Sun After compiling X R and all patches with the MotifBC flag set , we recompiled Motif and then we recompiled the application Did we skip a step or leave something out Is there a flag that we should have used Should we have left Motif alone Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated Thanks Kathy Kathy Saint She's a witch She's a witch I'm not dead yet How can you tell she's a witch She looks like one Monthy Python the Holy Grail
