From brown ftms UUCP Vidiot Subject Re viewing postscript files under X windows In article Gordon Sasamori writes In ftms UUCP brown ftms UUCP Vidiot writes OW is the same But, the definition of broken is relative Pageview requires DSC compliant PostScript files, in order to stop at page breaks I don't consider that broken I say that any program that puts out a PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken Well that may be true However, the man page for pageview for OW does not mention about DSC compliance In any event, the point here is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will find out that it's not a practical tool It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be DSC compliant That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at Sun I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview program does require DSC compliant PostScript There was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it would stop at each showpage I believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i e , you could only go forward to the next showpage This isn't in OW pageview, but maybe it is in the Solaris x version of OW OW In any event, I find pageview extremely useful Since all of the PostScript that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems harvard ucbvax uwvax astroatc ftms brown or uu psi com ftms brown rutgers INTERNET or ftms brown astroatc UUCP cs wisc edu
