From Peter Flynn Subject Compiling ghostview under Sun OpenWindows Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes, most standard GNU and other software won't compile out of the box well, tar file Right now I'm trying to make ghostview It complains it can't find X XaW so I just linked ln s the files from usr openwin share include X and now the ghoddam thing still complains it can't find them I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way Has anyone ever managed to get anything normal to compile on a Sun SunOS and OpenWindows What's the trick I'm missing I've even tried hard copying all the relevant files into the right places and every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it Peter
