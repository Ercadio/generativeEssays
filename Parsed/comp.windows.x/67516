From Jim Brandt Subject Multiple Heads on Sparc I have a SPARC with CGSIX cards in it I'd like to have the R server recognize the second card I mknod created a dev cgsix device, but when I brought up the server, the second device was ignored How do I setup the second card Note If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and a cgsix card in the same SPARC box, the R server finds the second card I then set the DISPLAY to the second card, and start a second window manager Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone out there has seen this problem already email is preferred post if you must Thanks in advance Jim Jim Brandt Hughes LAN Systems Hughes Network Systems South Winchester Blvd Suite San Jose, CA email email Voice Fax vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
