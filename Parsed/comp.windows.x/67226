From David Lapp Subject Re NumLock masking interference with Meta Compose ExtendChar Ralph Seguin rps wrote My question is this Is there a means of determining what the state of CapsLock and or NumLock is Ignore I have delved a bit deeper XKeyEvent and found what I was looking ev state has a bunch of masks to check against LockMask is the one for CapsLock Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta eg SGI's vendor server has being NumLock whereas Solaris OpenWindows has for Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling You'll have to check the keysym s on each of the keys for each The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier I suppose first found is as good as X doesn't handle locking modifiers that Hope that helps Dave Lapp Standard Disclaimer
