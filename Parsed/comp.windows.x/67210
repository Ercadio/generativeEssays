From Bob Shaw Subject question on xon in Hi folks Say I'm new to and have one quick In using xon xon machine name I notice that it always comes up with a very small window I'm pretty sure its the default My xterms all work Is xon supposed to read your for a font size xrdb q appears to show the right I can use xon with arguments such as xterm fn etc and everything is Of course you could always do a simple script to do this but I have a feeling I'm missing something simple Comments suggestions Thanks in advance Bob mm
