from phil ngai subject re looking for x windows on a pc in article technical support writes may i humbly suggest desqview/x? (of course, i'm biased...) i have a weird, oddball, one of a kind video card. it's an
orchid fahrenheit. i get to run it in 640x480 with dvx. at
least i don't have to worry about straining my eyes with that
super vga stuff.
