From Bruce Barnett Subject Re Title for XTerm In article Mark Lanzo writes Hint for Sun OS users use usr echo instead of bin echo or Csh's built in Otherwise you'll have to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string instead of using convenient octal Bad using usr echo is slower than the built in This is what I It does execute hostname once per shell window and does read in one extra But manipluating the titles does not require executing extra Oh yes it does execute some programs once per each But it stores them in a file for the next if HOSTNAME then setenv HOSTNAME hostname endif figure how how to generate escape bell and echo commands without a a line terminator I may have done this If so the variable E is set have I executed this script before on this system if E then echo already set the echo variables dev tty else if f HOSTNAME then source HOSTNAME else if echo n wc l then echo built in echo is bsd dev tty then berkeley style echo echo 'set ech echo n ' HOSTNAME echo set E echo a tr a ' ' HOSTNAME echo set B echo a tr a ' ' HOSTNAME echo 'set N ' HOSTNAME source HOSTNAME else echo built in echo is sysV dev tty echo 'set ech echo ' HOSTNAME echo 'set E ' HOSTNAME echo 'set B ' HOSTNAME echo 'set N c ' HOSTNAME source HOSTNAME endif Are we using shelltool cmdtool or xterm duplicate these aliases here to avoid problems if term sun then Sun Aliases alias Header ' ech E l E N ' alias IHeader ' ech E L E N ' else if term xterm then alias Header ' ech E B N ' alias IHeader ' ech E B N ' endif Bruce Barnett uunet barnett
