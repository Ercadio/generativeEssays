From Julian Anigbogu Subject X R on Solbourne Hi Netters, Having inherited a Solbourne S Sun Compatible , I was wondering if somebody has ported X R to this beast Since Solbournce Computer Inc folded up I don't know where I can get the kernel to move from R Since they never joined the MIT Consortium, the regular distribution doesn't work Any pointers will be highly appreciated Julian o Julian A
