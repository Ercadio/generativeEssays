From Sriram Srinivasah Subject Re Animation with XPutImage In article A , Derek C Richardson writes Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage is considerably slower factor of on average than the Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that the X protocol communication is slowing things down or XPutImage is inefficient or both My question is, what is the fastest way in X R to dump plane image data to a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now All help appreciated thanks Derek The fastest way is to use an X server with shared memory extension It uses shared memory if it is a local X server hence images don't have to be duplicated , and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension is not available, or if it's not the localhost Sriram
