From Technical Support Subject Re DESQview X on a PC In article qtk writes In article , writes I use DESQview X and I think it is great Where it really shines IMHO is to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with the display going to their screens You'll need to get DESQview X v DESQview X v suggested retail DESQview X to Other X Systems v suggested retail You also must be running a supported network FTP softwares PCTCP, Novell Lan workplace for dos, Sun Microsystems PC NFS, Beame and WHiteside, Wollongong pathway TCPIp or HP Microsoft Lan Manager if you don't have any of this network stuff, Quarterdeck will give you a copy of Novell TCPIP transprot for dos with the Network manager You can get more info by sending email to appropriately Actually, is our customer service department If you have technical questions, you can write to In my opinion, if you want to have other people logging in and running applications at your pc, you'll want to have a with Megs of RAM Also, the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET TSENG Labs chipset based graphics card Personally, I found that things ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives, but that is my experience only What sort of traffic is generated with the X calls I am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running DV X is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time Anyone have any ideas I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself To give you a real world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other It's not too much of a load on our Ethernet with maybe concentrators, so you have people on each segment If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on effectively a MHz Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have working programs running, you'll know it Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing , you could probably run people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you're going to see a slowdown from X bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also Quarterdeck Office Systems Internet Support Tom Bortels Pricing Ordering Tech Questions BBS FAX Compuserve GO QUARTERDECK Q Fax from touch tone phone for Technotes On Demand
