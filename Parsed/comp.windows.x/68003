From Mark A Davis Subject Re Looking for X windows on a PC Mark Wilkinson Ext writes Hi All, This is the first time I've posted to the net, so I hope this is going to the right people I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by process Engineers at work If you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such programs see a current copy of Unix World Magazine BUT your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone From experience You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install The performance will be at least four times better In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use On top of that they will cost about the same price a clone with MB RAM, ethernet card, very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP IP for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc you spend a whole lot of I can get Tektronix XP terminals for under , and the performance is over Xstones Mark A Davis Lake Taylor Hospital Norfolk, VA x Sys Administrator Computer Services mark taylor mark taylor UUCP
