From Inman Subject Re Honors Degrees Do they mean anything Kevin Davidson writes In my opinion a programming degree is still worth Yes but a CS degree is not a programming Does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught Computer Science is a branch of maths or the course I did was I've also done a Software Engineering course much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach The ability to program was an entry Try the ' Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle It's a conversion course but at least they teach REAL In the space of months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Also some basic low level stuff was covered as They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about The PASCAL is to be replaced by C C I think next year I learn't this and X Windows programming as well anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months depending on your tastes the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six months but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not Mackem
