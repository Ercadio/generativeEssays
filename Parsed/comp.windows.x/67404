From Samir K Patel Subject Background Processing in X Applications I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes I need to display this data on my X I tried to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works But the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting So I doesn't returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and It doesn't respond to users I button press events are queued and exected after server finished its Now I am going to try AppAddInput So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will Now I have some doubts which you may be able to When I fork a It will create to copy of my Right Now what does this two copies mean Two Where should I fork my What are the responsibilities of this How should I call this Can I fork more than one So that I can read from more than one servers Thanks Samir Patel
