From Marcus SCHNELL Subject Re Save Under with X R Hans Bos wrote I have the following problem on X R servers When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent We had the same problem and on most of our machines it works if we use Backing Store instead of Save under Marcus Marcus Schnell International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis IIASA A Laxenburg AUSTRIA Phone FAX Vice Commissioner of the Australian Rules Internet Football League ARIFL , ,
