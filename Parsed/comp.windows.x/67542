From Scott Moody Subject X server only on Sun I have been using a HDS X terminal and really like What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window One can then run a special client X program called a window manager either run motif or openlook from it's own firmware limiting the network traffic but having no HOME or run motif or openlook from some home place like a sparc or vms This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager without killing windows and then start up another Some of my VMS tools need special meta mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other Well the question is On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm slave program Basically I want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run the window Please respond my e mail as well as posting because of the large volumes in Scott Moody There are no answers just cross references uunet bcstec shuksan scott
