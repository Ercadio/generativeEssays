From Ingolf Markhof Subject Re Title for XTerm In article quh , Andre Beck writes In article C oL B , Thomas Wolfram writes Hey guys I work on many stations and would like this name and current logname to be in a title of Xterm when it's open and a machine name only when it's closed In other words, I want HOST and LOGNAME to appear as a title of opened XTerm and HOST when XTerm is closed How can I do it Almost all window managers twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates support escape sequences for it For your purpose put following into your login if you're using csh or tcsh , for sh you have to modify it if term xterm then echo LOGNAME HOST G HOST G endif This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they are I would think they are DCS device control sequence introduced, but may be a CSI sequence exists, too This MUST work on a dxterm VT and ANSI compatible , it may not work on xterms It works on xterms At least I have no problem with it Back to the original question I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop menu Here is a sample command xterm sl n ls i title ls i e rlogin ls i The n and title options give the text for window and icon As I use the tcsh a wonderful extension of the csh , I can do the following I have an alias precmd echo n ' HOST cwd G' in my tcshrc This is a special alias for tvtwm It is executed each time before printing the prompt So, I have the current host name and the current directory path in the title bar of my xterms UniDo Ingolf Markhof University of Dortmund, LS Informatik XII P O Box , D Dortmund , F R Germany Phone , Fax Email
