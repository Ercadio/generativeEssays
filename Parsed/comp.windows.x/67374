From Robert Gasch Subject Overriding default WM Behaviour I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it Then again I've had some problems with the mail system Apologies if this appears for the second time Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen Yet when I specify the geometry option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the geometry argument The question now is How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour Thanks for any hints Robert PS I'm working in plain X, using tvtwm Robert Gasch Der erste Mai ist der Tag an dem die Stadt ins Oracle Engineering Freihe tritt und den staatlichen Monopolanspruch De Meern, NL auf Gewalt in Frage stellt Einstuerzende Neubauten Headers From uupsi expo lcs mit edu xpert mailer Thu Apr remote from aolsys Received from uupsi by aolsys aol com id aa Thu, Apr EDT Received from srmftp psi com by uu psi com b PSI PSINet via SMTP id AA for Thu, Apr Received from expo lcs mit edu by srmftp psi com PSI PSINet id AA Thu, Apr EDT Received by expo lcs mit edu Thu, Apr Received from ENTERPOOP MIT EDU by expo lcs mit edu Thu, Apr Received by enterpoop MIT EDU id AA Thu, Apr Received from USENET by enterpoop with netnewsfor contact usenet enterpoop if you have questions To Date Apr GMT From Robert Gasch Message Id Organization Oracle Europe Subject Overriding Default Behaviour
