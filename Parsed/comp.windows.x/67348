from bill poitras subject re regression testing and x megan grenenger wrote i'd appreciate any feedback on capture playback tools for use with x clients. : any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
: particularly xtm, xrunner, autotester, and sri's capbak, smarts and exdiff. how about starting where i could find any of these. for the commercial
ones, at least a phone number would be appreciated. --
