From Jeffrey C Gealow Subject Standard Colormaps I'm working on an X R application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps The X R documentation says Usually, a window manager creates these colormaps I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps, things would be wonderful But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section of the X R XLIB documentation According to the section of the X R XLIB documentation p For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red max, red mult, and base pixel members are defined The other members are ignored To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression gray red mult base pixel xFFFFFFFF XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit lib Xmu CmapAlloc c, is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit lib Xmu LookupCmap c to select red max, green max, and blue max values for the call to XmuStandardColormap When the RGB GRAY MAP property is specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red max to of the total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green max to of the total number, and sets blue max ot of the total number Referring to section , one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red max to the total number of cells in the gray scale When the RGB GRAY MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, defined in mit lib Xmu StdCmap c, sets red mult, green mult, and blue mult all equal to Referring to section , one would expect green mult and blue mult to be ignored When red mult, green mult, and blue mult all equal , XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit lib Xmu CrCmap c, constructs a gray map The sum of red max, green max, and blue max gives the maximum gray value Referring to section , on would expect red max to give the maximum gray value
