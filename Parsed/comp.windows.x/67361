From Jeffrey Gealow Subject Standard Colormaps I'm working on an application and have concerns regarding standard The documentation says Usually a window manager creates these I wonder what window manager the writer had in Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be But not many applications seem to use standard Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section of the XLIB According to the section of the XLIB documentation For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap red max red mult and base pixel members are The other members are To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression gray red mult base pixel XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mit lib Xmu is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mit lib Xmu to select red max green max and blue max values for the call to When the RGB GRAY MAP property is specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red max to of the total number of cells in the gray scale sets green max to of the total number and sets blue max ot of the total Referring to section one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red max to the total number of cells in the gray When the RGB GRAY MAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap defined in mit lib Xmu sets red mult green mult and blue mult all equal to Referring to section one would expect green mult and blue mult to be When red mult green mult and blue mult all equal XmuCreateColormap defined in mit lib Xmu constructs a gray The sum of red max green max and blue max gives the maximum gray Referring to section on would expect red max to give the maximum gray
