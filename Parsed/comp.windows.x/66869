From Jason Drisko Subject Re app defaults files Hello When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app defaults check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory this is the app defaults file for BX in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file You can do this using the setenv command under Note that the name ends in so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to BX to get the app defaults to load To make sure the the app defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app defaults file exists in usr lib app defaults or usr openwin lib app defaults depending on how your system is set Once you have taken care of this set the systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed For example let's say I've installed BX in t then my system directory resource should be set like this systemDirectory t builderXcessory Thanks ICS Tech Support
