From Jeremy Payne Subject Re Xt intrinsics slow popups In article , writes wrote Help I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume , Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter popup dialog boxes and so on In example , page Creating a pop up dialog box The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me The button Press me pops up a dialog box The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time If I try to pop it up a nd time rd, th time , it is much slower Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get this behaviour fast response time for the first time but slow response time from nd time onwards Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time Thankyou Shirley Thanks to those who responded We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods running twm rather than olwm keeping olwm, but putting wmTimeout in the resources It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the window manager positioning the popup window Any guru who can analyse what is going on from this information, please post and let us know Thanks Shirley I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use XtTranslateCoordinates etc after realizing the main widget to calculate the location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the popup widgets before ever using them Calling SetValues repeatedly e g every time something pops up seems to be what slows you down I never delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though Jeremy Payne UIUC Neuroscience program College of Medicine
