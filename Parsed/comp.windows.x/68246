From Michael Elbel Subject Re Blinking Cursor in Xterm In allbery writes As quoted from by Bernward Averwald Back in the days of I did analyse the xterm The cursor was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the I doesn't seem to be changed 'til But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via XtAppAddTimeOut or similar The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also DESQview X which does this in its DOS windows Do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt So what I'm running emu on a MHz I cannot make out ANY difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or not If you think about it a bit a cycle of ms is a hell a lot of time for even the slowest PC Since you would of course only enable the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus this application is active To repeat it a blinking text cursor costs almost nothing in performance it just needs some thought when designing the xterm Michael Michael Elbel Digital PCS GmbH Muenchen Germany Intelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe Mia Fermentation fault coors dumped
