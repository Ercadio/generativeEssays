From Kurt George Gjerde Subject Re Drawing Lines inverse xor In article David Young writes XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex Then to draw I do XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow gc XFlush myDisplay And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing Instead what happens is I get white If the lines are over a white background nothing shows If the lines are over a black area nothing shows up It's very But the GXxor function seems right since if I do a rubber banding box it erases and redraws itself correctly not disturbing the underlying image Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong david Try change the GXxor to I have to do this for programs that are to run on NCD terminals on Sun terminals I have to change it back to GXxor
