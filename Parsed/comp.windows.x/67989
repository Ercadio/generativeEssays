From Markus Koch Subject X and Motif config file for HP UX Hello everybody out there I'm trying to compile X R pl and Motif on a HP running HP UX But it' seems to be not very succesful, because I have only hp cf config files for HP UX I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings The motif applications are compiled quite well, but they won't run I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but I cannot fix it The XKeysymDB file is at the right location and it works fine under SunOS Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong config file Please help me Thanx in advance Markus Markus Koch Universitaet GH Paderborn Email Rechnerbetreuung Phone Warburger Str W Paderborn, Germany Markus Koch Universitaet GH Paderborn Email Warburger Str Phone W Paderborn, Germany
