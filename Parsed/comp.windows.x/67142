From mahan Patrick Mahan Subject RE Program argument geometry I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments such as the geometry Since this is a standard X option I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there is some predefined function that will do this for me If you are using the Intrinsics it is parsed for If you are working at the Xlib level you can parse it yourself or you can use the following bit of static XrmOptionDescRec options geometry XrmoptionSepArg XPointer NULL define Number x sizeof x sizeof x XrmParseCommand db options Number options MyApplication argc argv Then use XrmGetResource to retrieve the value and parse it using XParseGeometry It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv however I much prefer using the X resource management routines to do Patrick Mahan TGV Window Washer Mahan Waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered Lazarus Long a capital For a first offense that is From the Notebooks of Lazarus Long
