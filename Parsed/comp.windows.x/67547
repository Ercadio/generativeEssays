From Janet A Barnett Subject Re Help BadMatch making bit win on bit server In article A Henrik W Nielsen writes I'm trying to make a bit window using XCreateWindow on a bit PseudoColor server As far as I know this should be possible if you stuff deleted Xio GSwin XCreateWindow Xio DspPtr, RootWindow Xio DspPtr, Xio Scr , x, y, w, h, , , InputOutput, Xtern ColorInfo, , SetWinAttrib This results in a BadMatch error Can anyone please tell me why The colormap element of SetWinAttrib must be a legitimate TrueColor colormap So, use XCreateColormap with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib and don't forget the mask And the inevitable caveat I usually use widgets, setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be wrong But, I think this is the general difficulty Allen Barnett whose wife graciously allowed to use her account
