From Subject REPOST Accelerators Translations I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same Can anybody help me out How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case What I want is Ctrl O and Ctrl o to both be accelerators on one menu In ORA in the section on accelerators it says For information on how to specify translation tables see this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator If you go to it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as For example the translation Shift Key q quit will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key and the q key This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl Key o should do what I want but it doesn't it doesn't work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o Is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators I am using Motif on a DECstation but I have also tried it on an HP using Motif and Steve Dennis Internet Software Engineer Applicon Ann Arbor Michigan Hail To The Victors
