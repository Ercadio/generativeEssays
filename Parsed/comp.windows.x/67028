From Doug Shaker Subject Re MacX color problem In article KuL ux cso uiuc edu, Stan Kerr writes I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem It's happened with the current version , and with version When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors It doesn't happen for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap This is a problem with all color X servers or at least all color Xservers I have seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap My solution is usually to avoid colormap greedy apps and display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color if this is an option for the application Doug Shaker voice fax email mail Qualix Group S Norfolk St , San Mateo, CA Qualix maintains a mailserver with information files and demo versions of products If you would like more information on the mailserver, send an email to or uunet qualix qfacts The email should take the following form BEGIN send help send index END Name Address Phone
