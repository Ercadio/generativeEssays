From greg Gregory Lehman Subject Looking for drawing packages I am developing an application that allows a user to interactively create edit view a visual model topology of their network and I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to simplify this In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM X product to develop other GUIs so I am familiar with UIMSs in The topology will support objects and connecting Once the topology is created I want to provide the user with capabilities to support grouping zooming I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing routines to accomplish Specifically the zooming and grouping aspects may prove difficult and certainly time consuming if I have to roll my own Suggestions greg
