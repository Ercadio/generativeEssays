From Andre Beck Subject Re bit Static color will clients like it In article Frederick Roeber writes I'm writing an X server for some video generation The hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit static color I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X The three problems I see are The colormap though huge is All pixels would be bytes Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB YUV will introduce some rounding Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these limitations thwart many X clients Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of bits but I'd rather avoid this if not Even TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated bit PseudoColor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and thelike to I strongly suppose you to emulate at least Bit Should be no problem only some Rounding should not make big misfits bit More of a problem you have to emulate a colormap pixel indices conversion Furthermore you should run your default screen on this o o o Brain Inside o o o o Andre' Beck ABPSoft mehl Andre Beck o o o
