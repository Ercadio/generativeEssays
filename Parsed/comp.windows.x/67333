From Andre Beck Subject Re bit Static color will clients like it In article A , Frederick Roeber writes I'm writing an X server for some video generation equipment The hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit static color visual I would really like to have the server just present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X clients The three problems I see are The colormap, though huge, is static All pixels would be bytes wide Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the translation RGB YUV will introduce some rounding error Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask will these limitations thwart many X clients Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e g , bits, but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary Even Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and thelike to run I strongly suppose you to emulate at least Bit TrueColor Should be no problem, only some translation Rounding should not make big misfits bit PseudoColor More of a problem, you have to emulate a colormap, pixel indices, conversion stuff Furthermore, you should run your default screen on this visual o o o Brain Inside o o o o Andre' Beck ABPSoft mehl Andre Beck IRS Inf TU Dresden de o o o
