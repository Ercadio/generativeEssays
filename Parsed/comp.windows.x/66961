From Paul Bash Subject Re and Open Look In article rgooch Richard Gooch writes In article writes I am reposting this because I am not sure my first post ever made it I have built and installed on my SPARCstation My aim is to run the MIT X server but retain the OpenLook Window I am sure this is not uncommon but I just want to make sure that I change and or delete everything that I need For instance I can start xdm in but how do I get rid of Xnews The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes or from would suggest building this too rather than using the version from It is olwm I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm This version of the olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even on large This version is also available at contrib The README file also suggest getting the files in contrib In my case I built the X Server first Xview second then All of these were installed into usr Once I verified the server worked correctly I happily issued rm rf usr openwin Using gcc to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that is for all intents and purposes identical to OpenWindows and that is incredibly There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want things to work exactly like OpenWindows but not Paul Bash Techware Design Boulder CO
