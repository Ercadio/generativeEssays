From Mark A Davis Subject Re xterm fonts Bernward Averwald writes In article M Mark A Davis writes I have a problem which many of you might have run into We use LOTS of ASCII terminals and use them to the max Meaning lots of attributes, line This means needing all attributes to work, including bold and line drawing The only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in which one is bold and the other normal, while both have linedraw, fixed spacing, and several sizes The only standard fonts which work are the fonts like x and x B under misc They work great, except I need a font one size larger, x Now x works well, but there is no bold counterpart You don't need a 'bold' counterpart From man xterm fb font This option specifies a font to be used when dis playing bold text This font must be the same height and width as the normal font If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font The default is to do overstriking of the normal font I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos termcaps are set up to NOT remap bold which they are be default to reverse, then nothing happens when bold is displayed It would appear at least in X R than you cannot display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts a normal and a bold I wish someone would prove that incorrect Mark A Davis Lake Taylor Hospital Norfolk, VA x Sys Administrator Computer Services mark taylor mark taylor UUCP
