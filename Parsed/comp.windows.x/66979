From Steve Weet Subject Xterm Cursor Forgive me if this is a FAQ I have checked the list but I cant find it I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO not grayscale monitors The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default Configuration is Motorola Please reply by email if Thank you Steve Weet European Mis Motorola Cellular Subscriber Group Beechgreen Court Chineham Basingstoke HANTS Phone E Mail Fax Mobile Post Steve Weet European Mis Motorola Cellular Subscriber Group Beechgreen Court Chineham Basingstoke HANTS Phone E Mail Fax Mobile Post
