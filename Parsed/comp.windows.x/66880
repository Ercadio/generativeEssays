From donaldlf Leslie Donaldson Subject Problems using Graphic Context with Athena widgets I am creating a graphics program using the Athena I use Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject and XtDisplayOfObject The object was one of the sub The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal I tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling XtAppMainLoop Thank you for any Leslie Donaldson
