From Michael Robb Subject Re Honors Degrees Do they mean anything In article Kevin Davidson writes In my opinion a programming degree is still worth Yes but a CS degree is not a programming Does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught Computer Science is a branch of maths or the course I did was I've also done a Software Engineering course much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach The ability to program was an entry At Robert Gordon University programming was the main most time consuming start of the The first two years consisted of five subjects Software Engineering Pascal C UNIX Computer Engineering assembler Computer Theory LISP Prolog Mathematics Statistics and Communication Skills How to pass interviews intelligence tests and group discussions How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea The third year Industrial placement was spent working for a computer company for a The company could be anywhere in Europe there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors The fourth year included Operating Systems C Modula Software Engineering C assembler Real Time Laboratory C assembler and Computing Theory LISP There were also Group Projects in and Years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly In the first four years there was a weighting between courseworks and exams for most However in the Honours year this was reduced to a split between an Individual Project and final exams no coursework assessment are all Computer Science courses like this BTW we started off with students in our first year and were left with by Honours Also every course is tutored Not easy trying to sleep when you are in student class Cheers Michael Michael Robb Tel problem with bolt on Software Engineer Fax software is making sure the Spider Systems Limited E mail bolts are the right Edinburgh Anonymous
