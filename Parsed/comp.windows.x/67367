From Paul Martz Subject Re Standard Colormaps In article senator Jeffrey Gealow writes I'm working on an application and have concerns regarding standard The documentation says Usually a window manager creates these I wonder what window manager the writer had in Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top The ESGE server we ship makes the XA RGB BEST MAP available at It doesn't wait for window managers to do Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard However xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be But not many applications seem to use standard Does your hardware have only one CLUT Since standard colormaps typically devour all entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default Rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA RGB BEST MAP or whatever it's called under If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that If you can't do that then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps paul Evans Sutherland
