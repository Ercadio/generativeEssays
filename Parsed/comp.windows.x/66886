From David Hughes Subject Re Motif Athena Andrew Berry writes My impression is that most people use Motif because their OS vendor supplies it with X SunOS users excluded and because it is similar in look and feel to MS Windows and OS Personally I also prefer the look and feel of Motif no flames please just an opinion Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun IBM HP can't remeber the other members in the recent announcement I'm sure you'll see it on virtually every workstation Sun IBM HP and DEC must make up the VAST majority of all hardware I am also concerned by this prevalence of Motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free As the Linux and communities grow however I think that Motif will lose some of its grip at least in the non commercial Ports of Motif to both and Linux are available for a fee of about This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups pertaining to Motif has been I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and non commercial software you will only get free software using Athena or OpenLook widget sets and only get commercial software using the Motif widget sets I can't see If just about every workstation will come with Motif by default and you can buy it for under for the free UNIX platforms I can't see this causing major Side Note All the X based code I am writing and will distribute freely when completed is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also look and feel point of view I like it the best no flames on this one please bambi David Hughes Senior Network Programmer Comms Development Operation AUSTRALIA
