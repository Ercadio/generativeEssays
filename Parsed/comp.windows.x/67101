From Richard Neitzel Subject XQueryBestCursor semi broken Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware a with a will claim cursors up to root window size are OK while a with a will stop at So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on Actually the NCD is even more liberal sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as Is XQueryBestCursor semi broken or is this behavior correct I'd really like to see a cursor Richard Neitzel Torren med sitt skjegg National Center For Atmospheric Research lokkar borni under sole vegg Box Boulder CO Gjo'i med sitt shinn jagar borni
