From David Lewis Subject Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Archive name x faq Last modified Subject How do I make a screendump or print my application The xwd client in the distributions can be used to select a window or the It produces an XWD format file of the image of that The file can be post processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing You can use this command csh sleep xwd root and then spend seconds or so setting up your screen the entire current display will be saved into the file Note that xwd also has an undocumented before id flag for specifying the window id on the command There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to Two publicly available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built in delays are asnap and There are several versions of xgrabsc version available on export is the most xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it it also renders XPM output version unknown It is available on export or see xsnap A screen dump and merge edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from as Information xprint by Alberto Accomazzi is available from in To post process the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr which is part of the Also on several archives are and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations see contrib and contrib Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers and the Xim package contains Level color PostScript The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and save it in one of the available ImageMagick has similar Also Bristol Technology offers Xprinter an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers a demo is on in vendor Bristol ColorSoft offers OPENprint package includes a screen capture facility image processing and support for PostScript and non PostScript Some vendors' implementations of X DECWindows and OpenWindows include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame buffer directly the Sun systems for example have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster Some X terminals have local screen dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial Some vendors' implementations of lpr Sony include direct support for printing xwd files but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the Subject How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display If you need color PostScript in particular you can grab the screen image using a program which can produce color PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv grab the screen image using xwd and post process xwd into color You can do this using or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim Subject How do I make a screendump including the X cursor This can't be done unless the X server has been Consider instead a system dependent mechanism for capturing the frame Subject How do I convert view Mac TIFF GIF Sun PICT img FAX images in X The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting among various image It includes support for many types of bitmaps gray scale images and full color PBMPLUS has been updated recently the most recent version is on export in contrib Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools 'imconv' in particular which packages the functionality of PBM into a single It's available anonymous ftp from Useful for viewing some image formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage a version of which is in the directory contrib clients xloadimage there are later versions available including contrib on Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export see and version was released xv X Image Viewer written by John Bradley can read and display pictures in Sun Raster PGM PBM PPM bitmap TIFF GIF and It can manipulate on the images adjust color intensity contrast aspect ratio crop It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus It can grab a portion of the X display manipulate on it and save it in one of the available The program was updated see the file contrib xv on The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation by Michael Mauldin Conversion and manipulation package similar to Version available via FTP as usr mlm ftp pub and graphics The Img Software Set by Paul Raveling reads and writes its own image format displays on an screen and does some image Version is available via FTP on as contrib img along with large collection of color The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to Available via FTP as pub urt pub urt and pub urt Xim The X Image Manipulator by Philip Thompson does essential interactive displaying editing filtering and converting of There is a version in the contrib area but a more recent version using and Motif is available from Xim reads writes

collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X The tool uses the MIFF format filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats PPM TIFF GIF SUN Raster etc are xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple portable and xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on and xtiff was announced in it includes Xlib and Xt A version of Lee Iverson's leei image viewing tool is available as contrib vimage on The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog some material from Larry Carroll Subject How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo ESC TEXT G where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed and G is a Control G the BEL character Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd 'cd echo n ESC cwd G' The digit ' ' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit ' ' instead and use ' ' to change only the icon Note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the prompt Note on an IBM RS is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a Subject Where can I find the xterm control sequences The best source of such information is in your sources in the file a PostScript version is in mit hardcopy clients O'Reilly's Volume the X User's Guide includes an version of the control sequences the standard volume will be available and a Motif version of the book is available The current guide includes an outdated version of the control Other good sources of information include the version of that document and also the file in the sources called mit clients xterm a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro GE CR D listing the It dates from but is fairly A hardcopy version was published in the December XNextEvent the XUG newsletter In a pinch a manual will last updated Subject Why does the xterm et al fail against the server Subject How can I use characters above ASCII in xterm In order to use special characters such as the o umlaut you need to stty but also to use a charcell font such as XTerm font medium r normal c XTerm boldfont bold r normal c The family is intentionally unspecified in this In addition you may want to set this in your shell setenv LC CTYPE iso For a given character above you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below try using man ascii For example o umlaut v is Alt v and the section character ' is Alt ' thanks to Greg Holmberg greg and Stephen Gildea Subject Why are my xterm menus so small You are probably setting the geometry small If you give a resource specification like this xterm geometry then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its But its popup menus don't they are in pixels and show up To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xterm Subject How can I print the current selection You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr However a program by Richard Hesketh specifically for manipulating the selection will help xselection PRIMARY lpr finds the primary selection and prints This command can be placed in a window manager menu or in shell xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other A version is on Also available is pub xget which can be adapted to do Subject How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt based programs XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and These environment variables control where Xt looks for application defaults files as an application is Xt loads at most one app defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app defaults files appear in several different directory Suppose for example that you are running Sun's Open Windows and you also have some X applications installed in usr lib app You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up app defaults files in both usr lib and usr openwin lib or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located setenv XFILESEARCHPATH usr lib T N OPENWINHOME lib T N The value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see XtResolvePathname N The value of the filename parameter or the application's class T The value of the file type In this case the literal string app defaults C customization resource only S None for app L Language locale and codeset ja l Language part of L ja t The territory part of the display's language string c The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the Suppose the application's class name is Myterm Also suppose Open Windows is installed in usr Notice the example omits locale specific usr lib T N means usr lib app defaults Myterm OPENWINHOME lib T N means usr openwin lib app defaults Myterm As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above app defaults files in the order As soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for The effect of this path is to search first in usr lib then in usr Let's consider another This time let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file in the current working directory then for Myterm in the directory app setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH HOME app defaults N The first path in the list expands to The second expands to HOME app defaults This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app defaults file in the application's source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded NOTE when looking for app default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so T and S are With there's another You may specify a customization resource For example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color If one of your pathname specifications had the value usr lib T N C then the expanded pathname would be usr lib app defaults Myterm color because the C substitution character takes on the value of the customization The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is usr lib L T N C usr lib l T N C usr lib T N C usr lib L T N usr lib l T N usr lib T N Note some sites replace usr lib with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is root L N C root l N C root N C root L N root l N root N root is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to a single In all this machinery worked differently for compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to a dot followed by a Thanks to Oliver Jones Subject How to I have the xdm put a picture behind the log in window The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example your usr lib xdm xdm config file may add the line false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log in beware and also DisplayManager xrdb usr lib xdm where that file does something for all connections along the lines of bin sh comes in with arguments display load usr lib xdm Xresources usr bin xsetroot display bitmap usr lib xdm usr bin xrdb Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to Note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other Thanks to Jay Bourland Subject Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my file When xdm runs your it doesn't source your or You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the file and your shell configuration file or if you set your PATH in your file the normal place you can make your have PATH set simply by making it a csh script by starting your file off with bin csh If this doesn't work also try starting off with bin sh Reset path PATH csh c 'echo PATH' export PATH Subject How do I keep my DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine There are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv DISPLAY whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running One solution is to use the clients xrsh on the contrib It includes xrsh a script to start an X application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote A more recent version is on export in xrsh One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse You can ftp caveat emptor versions from in X and X The program packages up TERM and DISPLAY into a single string which is stuffed into rlogin then propagates TERM normally your on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment In addition if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host and you find rsh HOST n usr bin xterm display DISPLAY too simple DISPLAY must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X The equivalent usage would be xrsh HOST xterm bin sh start an process on another host Date Dec GMT From Chris Torek rsh host n setenv DISPLAY DISPLAY exec dev null dev null An improved version rXcmd suggested by John Robinson generalized for sh ksh by Keith Boyer but they put the rcmd in 's which left zombies This script combines the best of case in echo Usage host x cmd case SHELL in csh host shift xhost host dev null rsh

bitmap editor Sun's icon editor tool post processed with pbmplus to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post processing to concatenate them into the BDF See Ollie Jones's article in the November X Journal for more The contrib area in fonts utils and in clients xtroff contained a number of useful utilities including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text An easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a version is on the or contrib tape in contrib clients Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on possibly as file pub windows X Diverse Sourcen It can produce BDF format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors pixmaps and Binaries for common machines are on in pub in addition the sources an old Xlib implementation have been placed in export If you are a MetaFont user you can use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format the distribution is on and on The GNU package fontutils on includes xbfe a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font The O'Reilly X Resource issue contains an article on using these tools to modify a Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize a new version is in Subject Why does adding a font to the server not work sic After you have built the font using your system's font compiler installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your system's equivalent bldfamily for OpenWindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path name to the server's font path or if the directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that you're probably leaving You can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in the Sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a BadValue error X Error of failed request BadValue integer parameter out of range for operation Major opcode of failed request X SetFontPath This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the The mention of an integer parameter in the message is Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file system Remember it's the server not the client which interprets your font Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it xset fp myfonts and the server is an X terminal or managed by Is the directory really a font directory If you're running an MIT server or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file If you can't find that file run mkfontdir If you're running OpenWindows look for the file If you can't find it run bldfamily If you're in a site where some people run servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats OpenWindows for example make sure the font directory is right for the server you're Hint if the directory contains and or files it won't work for Open If the directory contains and or files it won't work for thanks to der Mouse and to Oliver Jones Subject How do I convert a font back to font A tool called snftobdf is part of the bdftools package which is available from contrib and from pub misc Subject What is a general method of getting a font in usable format der Mouse's getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and produces a file for any font the server is willing to let It can be used as an anything to BDF converter but requires access to a server that can understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as getbdf is on in X or available via mail from mouse In addition the program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the server has access Subject How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non DECwindows server The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non DEC installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and Pick up the file contrib DECwindows on from this file is for a standard MIT It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font Subject How do I add fonts to my DECwindows server The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the You can produce this compiled format from the format by using DEC's dxfc font Note that the DEC servers can also use raw fonts with a performance Subject How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file What is XPM I want to be able to do something like this xclock backgroundPixmap usr include bitmaps rootweave You can't do The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth Because of this writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible since there is no accepted convention for a file format for Therefore neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets courtesy Chris Peterson now However A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted by Sebastian Wangnick it permits loading of a number of image formats as a The leading general purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs including the GWM window manager by AT T in its olpixmap editor and by ICS in its interface XPM distribution available on export as contrib includes read write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above See information on the xpm talk mailing list XPM was announced in and is available from and an older version is on the contrib A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen is on export in contrib Subject Why can't I override translations Only the first item You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first item like this basic override Ctrl Key a beginning of line n Ctrl Key e end of line extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation Thanks to Timothy Horton Subject How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones One solution is xchron in Volume of which can show the time for timezones other than the local Alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this bin sh TZ xclock name San Luis Obispo CA dev null TZ xclock name King Of Prussia PA dev null Subject I have xmh but it doesn't Where can I get MH The xmh mail reader requires the Rand MH mail message handling system which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many A list of various ftp uucp e mail and US mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in the monthly MH FAQ one source is in the file pub

faq Subject Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started no other clients are able to connect to The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun for at least delete old unreferenced files from tmp including tmp unix which contains the socket descriptor used by The solution is to add type s to the find exclusion in the cron Subject Why don't the PEX demos work on my mono screen The sample server implementation works only on color screens Subject How do I get my Sun Type keyboard fully supported by Xsun Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the appropriate effect on the numeric The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related It is available from in the file contrib Xsun The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type and Type This patch is available from in contrib or via email from thanks to Martin Forssen or A set of patches by William Bailey

source distribution directly from MIT please read the file mit bug report for Look in mit doc bugs bug report in Thanks to Stephen Gildea Subject Why do I get Warning Widget class version mismatch This error which typically goes on to say widget intrinsics indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with check your I include path and L link path to be However the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the Xt library before patch the version number was Some Sun OW systems in particular were shipped with the flawed version of the library and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have Subject Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster Webster's still owns the copyright to the on line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various university After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs webster it asked that server sites close off external The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the A Webster daemon for NeXT machines
