From Karen Bircsak Subject lost in TekHVC color space please respond via email Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from or with O'Reilly's ftp able example xcms from The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does which makes no sense to me The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid So you can't actually edit any We have patch level bit pseudoColor I've poked around in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have no idea what's going Can somebody confirm if either of the above mentioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail for you too Please include what hardware software patch levels you Any hints Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this Thanks Karen Karen Bircsak Concurrent Computer Corporation
