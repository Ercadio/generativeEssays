From Newman Subject Re Trouble compiling on SunOS In article Casper Dik writes Jeremy Epstein writes David Meleedy writes There's a bug in SunOS which is alluded to in the FAQ although there it's talking about as being affected You need to force libXmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works around the linker The simplest thing to do is edit each of the Makefiles where

later in ' containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous The SUG disk which was assembled by Robert Bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member for per disk including one of those hard to find caddies If you are not a SUG member you can become one for an additional if you live within the US or The SUG CDROM is an ISO disk which means it can be used by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well and
