From UK Yuri Rzhanov Subject XView slider Hi netters, I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field But I seem to have no control over the length of this field In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL MAX VALUE As I understand, PANEL VALUE DISPLAY LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that panel h contains the following bit Panel multiline text item, Panel numeric text item, Panel slider item and Panel text item attributes PANEL NOTIFY LEVEL PANEL ATTR ATTR ENUM, , PANEL VALUE DISPLAY LENGTH PANEL ATTR ATTR INT, , which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders But setting this attribute gives nothing, and xv get'ting this attribute gives warning Bad attribute, and return value Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem Any help is very much appreciated Yuri
