From Subject German keyboard ALT GR Hi ppl I am running under Linux and am trying to get the german keyboard I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called in usr lib so I ran xmodmap usr lib My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight There's still a little problem I can't solve however I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly The ALT GR key doesn't seem to I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it Looking up its keycode in the Xmodmap I found the entry Mode switch which doesn't ring any The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be Example keycode XX ssharp questn backslash The first entries I can even get The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the My guess is that it should be the key with ALT GR but it isn' If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be CU Alaric
