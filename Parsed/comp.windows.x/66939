subject mit r on sun with rasterops tc colorboard from mark davies is it possible to run an mit r based xserver on a sun with a rasterops tc
colorboard (24bit board)? i have the xsun24 patches for supporting sun's
24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else? i know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an ipx. cheers
