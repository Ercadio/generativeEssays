From Rus John Martin Subject Re Animation with XPutImage Hi I'm new to this group so please bear with me Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage is considerably slower factor of on average than the Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a This was on a Sparc It seems that the X protocol communication is slowing things down or XPutImage is both My question is what is the fastest way in to dump plane image data to a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with XPutImage in which case I might as well give up All help Derek In article Derek Richardson writes Derek Richardson Tel x Institute of Astronomy Fax Cambridge E mail Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into server resident Pixmap s using Once this is done the original XImages can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows Hope this is John
