From Frederick Roeber Subject bit Static color will clients like it I'm writing an X server for some video generation The hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit static color I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X The three problems I see are The colormap though huge is All pixels would be bytes Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB YUV will introduce some rounding Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these limitations thwart many X clients Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of bits but I'd rather avoid this if not I know there are no absolutes but I'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and Thanks Frederick Roeber CERN European Center for Nuclear Research e mail or work r mail CERN PPE Geneva Switzerland home
