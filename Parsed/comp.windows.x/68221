From Bob Campbell Subject Motif and OW compiling xcoral I've built xcoral on my system SunOS , X R , Motif , OW and it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral opens, locks the mouse into the window area doesn't accept any input from the mouse Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an empty terminal to login and kill xcoral Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif Is there a patch Bob Campbell Crayons can take you where no System Manager Starship can go HAO, NCAR Guinan STTNG DISCLAIMER My views are in no way connected to my employer A closed mouth gathers no feet Unknown It only requires a little thought and a little work Don Hicks Managing Editor Amazing Computing
