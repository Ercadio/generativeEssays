From gnohmon Ralph Betza Subject dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in twm I consider TWM style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap and since two windows aren't enough I have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles here's a crude picture Figure title A title B title C this is the window B hides window C but body of the you can still see C's title window window A which is squeezed Figure Squeezed titles allow me to have about such windows in each stack with easy access and per stack is usually more than I really need since I also insist on having a virtual The only problem is that the title location is static that is it is configured in and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window Doing so is cumbersome and time Therefore I have implemented left center right functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this title A this is the body of the window window A to this title A this is the body of the window window A So far so Now how the heck do I get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm And the next xyztwm that I never heard of One way would be to post in a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing look back up at Figure and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C now window A's title hides Window B's title but when you hit the result is title B title A title C this is the body of the window window A which is on The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my copy of it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction routine in ifdef SHAPE case F SQUEEZELEFT static SqueezeInfo left squeeze J LEFT if DeferExecution context func Scr SelectCursor return TRUE tmp win squeeze info left squeeze SetFrameShape tmp win break and similarly for squeezeright J RIGHT and squeezecenter J CENTER endif Of course you also have to define F SQUEEZELEFT in and add FKEYWORD F SQUEEZELEFT and so forth to In order to use these functions add something like the following to your file m s w v d r i t door About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I think it didn't get Since then blast has appeared in Volume Issue you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwm style wide Better to have a twm style window manager I Ralph Betza FM uunet ssiny gnohmon The question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can think Lenny Dykstra
