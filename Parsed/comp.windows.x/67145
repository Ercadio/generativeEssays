from passau de christian rank subject xsun not running on sparcclassic i've installed x r with patches for solaris on our sparcstation lx /
sparcclassic pool. on the lx, x11r5 runs fine, but on the classics,
after giving the command startx, xsun prints the following messages: warning: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space! mapping cg3c: no such device or address
and exits. does anybody know how to fix this problem? thanks in advance. ---
