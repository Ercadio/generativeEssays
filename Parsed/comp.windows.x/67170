From Andre Beck Subject Re Animation with XPutImage In article Derek Richardson writes Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in I put together a quick test and I've found that XPutImage is considerably slower factor of on average than the Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a This was on a Sparc It seems that the X protocol communication is slowing things down or XPutImage is both My question is what The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server memory this is the The conversions in the XPutImage are is the fastest way in to dump plane image data to a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with Yes by utilizing the MIT SHM extension that provides an XPutImage derivate that uses shared Fine XPutImage in which case I might as well give up You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps thus moving them to server memory and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea BUT be aware this is a major server memory bummer o o o Brain Inside o o o o Andre' Beck ABPSoft mehl Andre Beck o o o
