From David Young Subject Drawing Lines inverse xor I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber band boxes in Motif I'm running on an bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is Currently to draw interactively I begin with drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground my default bg color is the color index for the background of my image palette colors drawIndex palette colors my default bg color palette colors drawIndex palette colors my default bg color palette colors drawIndex palette colors my default bg color XStoreColors myDisplay my cmap palette colors DrawIndex XFlush myDisplay XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex Then to draw I do XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow gc XFlush myDisplay And when I'm all done to return things to normal I do XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing Instead what happens is I get white If the lines are over a white background nothing shows If the lines are over a black area nothing shows up It's very But the GXxor function seems right since if I do a rubber banding box it erases and redraws itself correctly not disturbing the underlying image Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong david
