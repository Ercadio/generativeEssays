From David Young Subject Drawing Lines inverse xor I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber band boxes in Motif X I'm running on an bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground my default bg color is the color index for the background of my image palette colors drawIndex red palette colors my default bg color red palette colors drawIndex green palette colors my default bg color green palette colors drawIndex blue palette colors my default bg color blue XStoreColors myDisplay, my cmap, palette colors DrawIndex , XFlush myDisplay XSetFunction myDisplay, gc, GXxor XSetForeground myDisplay, gc, drawIndex Then to draw I do XDrawLine myDisplay, XtWindow drawingArea , gc, x , y , x , y XFlush myDisplay And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do XSetFunction myDisplay, gc, GXcopy What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over Instead what happens is I get white lines If the lines are over a white background nothing shows up If the lines are over a black area nothing shows up It's very strange But the GXxor function seems right since if I do a rubber banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong david
