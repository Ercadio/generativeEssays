From John Ngai Subject How to disable reverse video on xterm man Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try I am running xterm and like all UNIX users I run man something Recently I switched to Solaris and their man pages are littered with directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under The resulting output admittedly a personal taste is very ANNOYING to look Back when I was using SunOS I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under directives for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling directives are fine I like And of course I don't want to go in and edit the man pages Somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font Any pointers suggestions are greatly Thanks John Running xterm rv won't work I
