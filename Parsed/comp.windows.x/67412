From Karsten Spang Subject Cannot create plane window Hello X'ers I have a problem I am not able to create a window with bit planes The following code illustrates the problem include stdio h include X Xlib h include X Xutil h main Display display Window win XVisualInfo vinfo Colormap colormap XSetWindowAttributes attributes XEvent event Status status display XOpenDisplay NULL status XMatchVisualInfo display,DefaultScreen display , ,TrueColor, vinfo if status fprintf stderr, Visual not found n exit colormap XCreateColormap display,DefaultRootWindow display , vinfo visual,AllocNone attributes colormap colormap win XCreateWindow display,DefaultRootWindow display , , , , , , ,InputOutput,vinfo visual,CWColormap, attributes XMapWindow display,win for XNextEvent display, event I tried this with an SGI with plane TrueColor server, and with an HP plane DirectColor server with the obviously neccessary change , both running X R On the client side, I have tried with X R Xlib on HP and DECstation, and with X R Xlib on DECstation All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual But the visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message What am I doing wrong For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error Karsten InterNet Karsten Spang Phone Kampsax Data Fax P O Box DK Hvidovre Denmark
