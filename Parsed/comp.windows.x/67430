From Subject click to focus point to focus I am having the problem of ensuring point to focus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my I'm using InterViews but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in For example I use OpenWindows on a with point to focus set and that generally works but not always depending on what was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell tool window to Or so it My question then is what can I do within X to guarantee point to focus within my application Thanks for any Dave
