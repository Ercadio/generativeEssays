From rgooch Richard Gooch Subject Re and Open Look In article writes I am reposting this because I am not sure my first post ever made it I have built and installed on my SPARCstation My aim is to run the MIT X server but retain the OpenLook Window I am sure this is not uncommon but I just want to make sure that I change and or delete everything that I need For instance I can start xdm in but how do I get rid of Xnews The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes or from would suggest building this too rather than using the version from It is olwm Regards Richard
