From Tobias 'Doping' Bading Subject Re Forcing a window manager to accept specific coordinates for a window In article Richard Verhoeven writes Sorry but olwm and tvtwm don't do They place the title at that position and the window at a position below This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is Currently my solution is XCreateWindow XSetWMProperties XMapWindow XFlush XMoveWindow It works with olwm but is less than All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user Maybe other window managers have similar Another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your Unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this Greeting Tobias
