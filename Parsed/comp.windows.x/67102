From mahan Patrick Mahan Subject RE XDM DECnet Does XDM work with DECnet I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP IP and I have a number of X terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP IP and Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X terminals using TCP Since XDM is basically just an X windows client shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well XDM is not just an X Window XDM has its own protocol XDMCP that operates of UCP on port It does provide a Login window which is an X Window As to using DECnet Looking through the source for XDM from that I have here it seems that the bare bones code is there but not completely My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X It is making TCP IP specific socket In this case the answer would be no you can not run XDM over Is this right or not Any feedback is From my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped with Patrick Mahan TGV Window Washer Mahan Waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered Lazarus Long a capital For a first offense that is From the Notebooks of Lazarus Long
