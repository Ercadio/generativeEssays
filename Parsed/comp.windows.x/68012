so I hope this is going to the right people I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by process Engineers at work Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago This question seems to come up often enough that I figured this would be of interest Note that the server X Appeal for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via anonymous ftp This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of using your system as an X server Enjoy Pete
