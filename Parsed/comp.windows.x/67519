From Rudy Bonefas Subject Need X Win PopUp Menu package Rather than write my own can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create cascaded popup menus in X For reasons of portability the package should not rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Something written in C would be nice Thanks
