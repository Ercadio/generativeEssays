From Mark Klamerus Subject EventHandlers on XmPushButtons Help I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across the top a toolbar I wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over I've done this fine but I've turned up the following problem When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get callbacks on LeaveWindow This seems I would expect this to be an all or nothing type of Is this a bug If not can someone explain this behavior thanks Mark
