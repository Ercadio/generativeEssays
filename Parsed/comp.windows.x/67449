From smarks Stuart Marks Subject Re Xt intrinsics slow popups In article Bryan Boreham writes The shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its positioning The window manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the x y position given in ReparentNotify Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify At this point the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of If a SetValues is done using the same x y position the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it However a mis feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmTimeout has Actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the x y positioning information in ReparentNotify This has been implemented and is available in public fix This is XBUG for those of you who are interested in gorier s'marks Stuart Marks Window Systems Technology Garcia M S SunSoft Mountain View CA
