From Casper H S Dik Subject Re Xsun not finding default font Sol code COM Joel Reymont writes Hi, netters I've just built X R pl under Solaris I've used the multi screen patch, as well as the R SunOS patch and everything builds great, except for that error message Xsun gives me upon startup It says Cannot set default font path ' stuff deleted ' and Cannot set default font 'fixed' If I supply the fp option, it doesn't complain about the font path but still complains about the font I have symlinks from usr lib to the place where my distribution lives Try to run Xsun under truss The best way to do this is by logging in over the network and typing truss t open Xsun open opt X R lib X fonts misc fonts dir , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts misc fonts alias , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts Speedo fonts dir , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts Speedo fonts alias , O RDONLY, Err ENOENT open opt X R lib X fonts dpi fonts dir , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts dpi fonts alias , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts dpi fonts dir , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts dpi fonts alias , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts misc x pcf , O RDONLY, open opt X R lib X fonts misc cursor pcf , O RDONLY, This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be If you have defined a project root and done a make install, everything should have gone right by default, even without symbolic links Casper
