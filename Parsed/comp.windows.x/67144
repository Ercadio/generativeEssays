From Paul Martz Subject Re Animation with XPutImage In article A , Derek C Richardson writes Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage is considerably slower factor of on average than the Sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that the X protocol communication is slowing things down or XPutImage is inefficient or both Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client server communications mechanism you are using Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is much cheaper Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running in XSynchonize mode paul Evans Sutherland
