From Michael Elbel Subject Re Blinking Cursor in Xterm In senator writes On Fri May GMT Michael Elbel said ME As is emu won't work on BSD derived systems SUNs with ME anything else than a There is a fix to this which is very ME short remove one line of code I'll put this on export It's more than that In the version on export one cannot just specify a POSIX tty behaviour the POSIX config files are incomplete without those of some specific platforms like Suns and I looked twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty Is there a cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty explicitly Hmm depends on how you define 'clean' Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we haven't gotten around to really implement and test a top level include file specifically for just The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty for example but here we also use some bsd All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than ' ifdef'ing in existing The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty file that fully relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me so I can't do the port I would suggest you read the README in term sysdep and if you have any problems or questions contact me and we could try to sort this Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we just don't have access to that many different Michael Michael Elbel Digital PCS GmbH Muenchen Germany Intelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe Mia Fermentation fault coors dumped
