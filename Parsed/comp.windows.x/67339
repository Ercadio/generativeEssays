From Paul Martz Subject Re bit Static color will clients like it In article Frederick Roeber writes I'm writing an X server for some video generation The hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a bit static color I would really like to have the server just present this static visual but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to most X The three problems I see are The colormap though huge is All pixels would be bytes Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the translation RGB YUV will introduce some rounding We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a TrueColor The main problems we encountered were Clients written with logic like the following if DefaultDepth Assume default depth is These clients need an deep visual in the root window to run Other clients didn't even bother to do that much and just outright assumed they had a dynamic visual class with a dynamic XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but many clients don't bother to check they just start throwing XStoreColor calls at Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose PseudoColor as a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right paul Evans Sutherland
