From Pramod Mahadev Subject Help on xlib and include files Hi Xperts I have a Sparc with very limited disk space on usr previously i was able to run all x windows applications and then i upgraded my system to sun and realized that the hard disk did not have enough space to load My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the This resulted in not loading As a result of which none of the X libraries got I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin files required for running X windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and In a desperate effort to regain x windows i retrieved usr lib libX files from the tape usr bin and usr include Is this enough for running X windows BUt i did not get usr lib fonts sub directories these are mainly and when i run xinit the error message says usr lib fonts etc are not in the default But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a GB disk and load openwindows to just have my x windows Thanks Pramod
