the Here are a few complications fix is in four parts you need to request and separately the file which was part of an earlier patch was re released with patch note the file doesn't work with Solaris fix is in two parts and fix is in three parts and fix is in two parts and fix replaces the for the X Test Suite which previously was optional fix also needs which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for fix is in parts through Subject What is the xstuff mail archive The xstuff server is a mail response That means that you mail it a request and it mails back the Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help The xstuff server treats the Subject header line just like any other line of the The archives are organized into a series of directories and Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an The top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level For example you can say send index fixes or index fixes A message that requests an index cannot request if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the To name an item you give its directory and its For example send fixes You may issue multiple send The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota it sends the requests out shortest Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return If you use such a mailer you won't get any If you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use The xstuff server itself can be reached at If your mailer deals in notation try sending to
