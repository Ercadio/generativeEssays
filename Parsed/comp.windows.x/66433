From David B Lewis Subject comp windows x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Archive name x faq part Last modified Subject Where can I get patches to X R The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp windows x announce newsgroup Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X is available They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp sources x Some source re sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server It now has patches for X R Send to the Subject line send fixes where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch Here are a few complications fix is in four parts you need to request a , b , c and d separately the file sunGX uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was re released with patch note the file doesn't work with Solaris fix is in two parts a and b fix is in three parts a , b , and c fix is in two parts a and b fix replaces the R fix test for the X Test Suite, which previously was optional fix also needs PEXlib tar Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for PEXlib uu fix is in parts, a through i Subject What is the xstuff mail archive The xstuff server is a mail response program That means that you mail it a request, and it mails back the response Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help The xstuff server treats the Subject header line just like any other line of the message The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an index The top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it The command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file if your message contains a line whose first word is index , then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index For example, you can say send index fixes or index fixes A message that requests an index cannot request data if your message contains a line whose first word is send , then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the line To name an item, you give its directory and its name For example send fixes a b You may issue multiple send requests The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest first Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response If you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like path foo or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it The xstuff server itself can be reached at If your mailer deals in notation, try sending to someplace mit eddie expo lcs mit edu
