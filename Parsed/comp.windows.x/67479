From Han N Nguyen Subject Action Translation Table implementation Hello, Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications We are trying to use action translation tables to implement this We have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application The Xt calls we make are included below It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations, and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications If someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated Platform Sun Sparc w X R Motif static XtActionsRec actionsTable up , do up , right , do right , middle , do middle , left , do left , down , do down , bye , quit , static char defaultTranslations Key KP up n Key KP right n Key KP middle n Key KP left n Key KP down n Key KP bye XtTranslations trans table, trans table XtAddActions actionsTable, XtNumber actionsTable trans table XtParseTranslationTable defaultTranslations widget XtCreateManagedWidget msg , xmPushButtonWidgetClass, form, wargs, n XtOverrideTranslations widget, trans table
