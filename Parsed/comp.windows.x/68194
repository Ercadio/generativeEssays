From William L Jones Subject Re Outline scalable fonts versus bitmap replicated scalable fonts After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing My problem with the resolution x foints is due to an installation problem That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find to meet your requirements This means that if you server return a response like the following adobe helvetica medium o normal p iso You can ask for the follwogin adobe helvetica medium o normal p iso and it will generate it for you You should try to always use known pixel sizes Bill Jones
