From adrian ora COM Adrian Nye Subject Re Keyboard mapping and window placement questions If I use Xt, all O'Reilly has to say is ' is automatically handled by Xt ' If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent , I get nothing This all stems from problems with users of the Sun keyboard and the NumLock plus various Alt Meta etc modifier requirements That's not all it says The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter of Volume Four or chap in older Athena editions , where there is about pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One, chapter You should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated Adrian Nye O'Reilly and Associates
