From Brian V Smith Subject Re Xfig pl on HP UX In article sp c , urban sideshow Michael P Urban writes I have compiled xfig patchlevel with HP's X R from HP UX , augmented by the Athena and Mu libraries from an X R distribution from iworks ecn uiowa edu It compiles nicely although for one file the preprocessor macro definition table size needed to be increased But when executed, nothing happens at all except for ever growing memory requirements eventually climaxing in a core dump The binary of the identical program, compiled on with X R , has no problems Other programs like xtpanel compile, link, and run just fine with the same libraries Does this sound familiar, or am I going to have to figure this one out on my own Please see the post I made yesterday May which fixes the problem This was posted to comp windows x apps Brian V Smith Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory I don't speak for LBL they don't pay me enough for that
