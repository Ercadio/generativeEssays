What are these common abbreviations acronyms Xt The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are An Xt based program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the Xmu The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and Xaw The Athena Widget Set is the MIT implemented sample widget set distributed with Xm The OSF Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation binary kits are available from many

Management System Subject What is the ICCCM How do I write X friendly applications The Inter Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same If you are writing X clients you need to read and understand the ICCCM in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window Get it either as part of the distribution from MIT in the later editions of the Scheifler Gettys X Window System book as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume X Protocol Reference A version in old copies of their Volume is The version in the Digital Press book is

Supplement for Release The complete document is on the Alternate definition the ICCCM is generally the M in RTFM and is the most important of the least read X Subject What is the X Consortium and how do I join The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System MIT's role is to provide the vendor neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this Membership in the Consortium open to any There are two categories of membership Member for large organizations and Affiliate for smaller organizations Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when As designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating Typically a small multi organization architecture team leads the design with others acting as close observers and Once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed The standards process typically includes public review outside the Consortium and a demonstration of proof of Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is Write to Bob

Subject Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces GUIs OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT T and many industry reviewers Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation OSF with input from many OSF OPEN LOOK is primarily a user interface specification and style guide there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK Motif includes an API specification the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from However there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF Motif one of these ParcPlace's formerly Solbourne's OI is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif at the user's OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT T comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of Thanks to Ian Darwin Subject Just what is OpenWindows Open Windows is a Sun product that encompasses a window system that combines a NeWS and compliant server X NeWS a user interface specification OPEN LOOK and a series of toolkits that implement it including the SunView like XView and the Xt based OLIT Xlib and Xt implementations and a number of utilities olwm window manager filemgr shelltool thanks to Frank Greco Subject Just what is DECWindows DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses an server the XUI toolkit including the Dwt widget set and UIL Xlib and Xt implementations a session manager and a number of utilities dxwm window manager dxcalendar dxpsview At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be Subject What is PEX PEX is the PHiGS Extension to X PHiGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering objects the extension allows the client PHiGS in this case to take advantage of the specialized hardware for Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable copyright similar to the current X copyright sample Source and documentation are available in the Several vendors are currently selling independently developed PEX servers for their workstations and X last modified Subject What is low bandwidth X LBX XRemote PPP SLIP CSLIP There are several options for using X over serial lines SLIP Serial Line IP this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point to point serial It has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major TCP IP Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly The TCP IP headers add bytes per packet and the TCP IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose rightfully so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high speed links CSLIP Compressed header SLIP this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the bytes of TCP IP headers down to about or It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X Modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time PPP Point to Point Protocol this is an emerging standard for point to point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP IP protocols over serial Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it XRemote this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP CSLIP XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data This work is done by either a pseudo X server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem You don't have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them if you were going to be directly connected and It reduces the I O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and In addition to the effects of it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to LBX Low Bandwidth X this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly used information connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps and a more efficient encoding of the X The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from in contrib in the following files XRemote slides describing XRemote XRemote LBX more slides describing some of LBX information provided by Jim Fulton There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the MIT X Technical Subject TOPIC USING X IN DAY TO DAY LIFE Subject What are all these different window managers The window manager in X is just another client it is not part of the X window system although it enjoys special privileges and so there is no single window manager instead there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout decoration and keyboard and colormap In approximate chronological order generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM wm this simple title bar window manager was phased out in or uwm the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed although it is very Moved to contrib on the twm old Tom's Window Manager was among the first non MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re parenting window awm the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features dynamic menus not found on more current window managers cwm cwm is part of the Andrew rtl Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred dxwm Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering hpwm HP's window manager offers a look it is a precursor of mwm mwm the Motif window manager is part of the OSF Motif toolkit tekwm Tektronix's window manager offering olwm Sun olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality olwm AT T ditto gwm Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built in Lisp Version is on the contrib tape is on and m swm the Sigma window manager is on the tape pswm Sun's PostScript based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release swm Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window configuration information comes from the resources file twm new MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the tape vtwm vtwm offers some of the virtual desktop features of swm with a single root window implementation it is based on the twm and is available on archive A new version vtwm is based on and is available from tvtwm Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual root window of It is available on archive servers olvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to Sun's It is available on archive servers version is on mvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to OSF's A beta version is floating around most recently from but requires a source license to OSF Motif NCDwm the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look XDSwm the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals ctwm Claude Lecommandeur's modification of the twm offers virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm source is on Version also offers the window overview used in vtwm and vuewm HP's MWM based window manager offers configurable SGI's enhanced MWM piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus Subject Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager sic It needn' What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your or file your X session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging Instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name Login rv iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window Subject Can I save the state of my X session like toolplaces does Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature which may be equivalent to writing out a or file naming the geometry and WM COMMAND of each application but olvwm may have something close there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for although it is not as complete as the SunView program Look for the application xplaces on an archive server near There are several versions of this program floating around look for a recent Some new pseudo session managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently running applications and the resource Bjxrn Stabell Subject How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by To override this add to your file something like this line naming the full pathname wherever usr bin your favorite wm Subject How do I change the keyboard auto repeat rate You can turn auto repeat on or off by using xset r on off The X protocol however doesn't provide for varying the auto repeat rate which is a capability not supported by all Some servers running on systems that support this however may provide command line flags to set the rate at start up If you have control over server start up see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the server with the chosen settings for example you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options to reduce the sensitivity of the Subject How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular The xmodmap client which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places just rearranges keys and does not do macro Some few clients including xterm and several X based editors accept a translation resource such as xterm override Key string setenv DISPLAY unix which permits the shorthand to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm To include control characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to Window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor has a special remapper client been made David Lewis faq Just the
