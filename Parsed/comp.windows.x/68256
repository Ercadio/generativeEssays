from ken mandelberg subject graphics text with x are there any graphics texts with examples demos projects directly in x the last time i taught the course, i used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package, with implementations available for
x/mac/pc. the problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package, but frustrated that they
couldn't really use their skill for other work. ---
