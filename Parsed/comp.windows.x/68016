From root grok ColumbiaSC NCR COM Ernie Coskrey Subject Re xterm fonts In article M , Mark A Davis writes I have a problem which many of you might have run into We use LOTS of ASCII terminals and use them to the max Meaning lots of attributes, line draw, etc Now what I need to do is come up with a working xterm which will emulate our advanced ASCII terminals as closely as possible This means needing all attributes to work, including bold and line drawing The only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in which one is bold and the other normal, while both have linedraw, fixed spacing, and several sizes The only standard fonts which work are the fonts like x and x B under misc They work great, except I need a font one size larger, x Now x works well, but there is no bold counterpart To make matters worse, I need the fonts in some form I can use for Tektronix Xterminals It seems they like pcf format, although I should be able to convert a bdf format Anyone have any suggestions Mark A Davis Lake Taylor Hospital Norfolk, VA x Sys Administrator Computer Services mark taylor mark taylor UUCP This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the bdf file I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access to the X source , and could make your own bold font from this Since each glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each glyph to a bitmap readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph bold , and convert the results back to bdf format Then, use bdftopcf to create the pcf file Then, stick the pcf in usr lib X fonts misc or wherever and include it in fonts dir and, voila, you'll have what you need Ernie Coskrey NCR Corporation MCPD Columbia Ernie Coskrey ColumbiaSC NCR COM Platt Springs Road West Columbia, SC I'm out there busting my buns every night Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for minutes Roger Murdoch, co pilot
