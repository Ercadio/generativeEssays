From brendan oc s emh ARmy MIL Brendan McKenna Subject Problems with characters above Hi all, I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting my poor old HP to let me input display characters above I have the following in my Xdefaults XTerm Font adobe courier bold r normal m iso So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm I have NOT set my LC CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that that locale is not supported apparently we have no additional locales defined, or at least, lib locale doesn't exist I can get some of the characters above to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them for example, Alt v does not produce a u umlaut This leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings, which are as follows speed baud line susp undef dsusp undef intr C quit erase H kill K swtch eof D eol min time stop S start Q parenb parodd cs cstopb hupcl cread clocal loblk crts ignbrk brkint ignpar parmrk inpck istrip inlcr igncr icrnl iuclc ixon ixany ixoff ienqak isig icanon iexten xcase echo echoe echok echonl noflsh opost olcuc onlcr ocrnl onocr onlret ofill ofdel tostop Anyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated Thanks Brendan
