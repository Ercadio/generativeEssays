TOPIC BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION topic needs updating to Subject What's a good source of information on configuring the X build This FAQ includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite you on particular However the best source of general information on building the release is found in the Release The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately the file ms PS TXT at the top of the The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail In addition O'Reilly Associates's Volume on X Administration includes information on configuring and building Subject Why doesn't my Sun with a work with Apparently gcc is the problem it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the The new distributed with fix may fix the problem note not known to work on Solaris Subject Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS know about dlsym If you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with Add ldl to your and eventually your You may want to surround it with Bstatic ldl Bdynamic if you add it to the EXTRA LIBRARIES variable since syslibs get added after EXTRA LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared Or compile the stubs thanks to Joe Backo Subject What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS In SunOS Sun fixed a shared library bug in ld which conflicts with the way builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols to be undefined when building some clients get wmShellWidgetClass get applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic appears to To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows based Xt please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches Patch Description OpenWindows libXt Jumbo patch OpenWindows undefined symbols when using shared libXmu Greg Earle earle A source patch for use with the MIT libraries was developed by Conrad Kimball it retrofits into some fixes made in to get around this The patch is on export in contrib patch Subject Why can't gcc compile on my SPARC I used gcc to compile the whole distribution but I get several segmentation faults when running Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the or VAX Here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc compiled parts of X are linked with Sun supplied functions that pass or return structs run time errors Affected programs include rgb and the This is from the GCC manual On the Sparc GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for It passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by This really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in GNU CC so it isn't straightforward to fix The convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpcc struct return' does not You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with compilation Files which need to be compiled using cc include server os rgb In addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values clients xhost clients xauth Calls to inet addr in lib CLX and lib X are possibly harmless as they don't involve collected by Don Bashford Subject What are these I O errors running X built with gcc When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error Getting interface configuration Operation not supported on Fatal server bug no screens Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't You can do this simple test include sys SIOCGIFCONF Run that through cc E and gcc The last line of output is the piece of interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i' your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other go back to your gcc sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the X If they are identical try running a make clean in mit server and rebuilding just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include courtesy der Mouse mouse Subject What are these problems compiling on the older In mit server ddx sun we have found missing defines for MONOLEN MONOLEN ENBLEN What should these be The Errata list distributed after mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions to compile define MONOLEN define ENBLEN MONOLEN define MONOLEN MONOLEN define ENBLEN MONOLEN However the should not actually ever have the device and so references to it can be removed from mit server ddx sun and the Subject What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS The file sundev isn't being Sun omitted sundev from SunOS Remove the include from and replace it with the line define VADDR COLOR The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another Subject What are these problems using shared libraries on SunOS All of the executables that I try to run have the following results not found or even call to undefined procedure GetHostname from If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you've installed X on a file server run it on the server's clients too While building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have those distributed with OpenWindows You should make sure you do not have LD LIBRARY PATH set in your environment during the build or the If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib usr local lib or usr for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked statically courtesy MIT X Consortium Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass Bstatic to most C compilers Subject Can OLIT programs run with Xt XtQString undefined This is a bug in the XtQString was an external symbol that existed in upon which OW 's libXt is based It wasn't documented and was removed in MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the and libraries only applied to the documented interface A workaround is to temporarily set your LD LIBRARY PATH to point to the or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program from Barry Margolin from Jeff Francis Subject How do I get around the SunOS security hole There is a security problem with certain clients xterm and xload running under SunOS that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these make the program non You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources ptys and dev kmem used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your relink the programs statically using Bstatic install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the from Bob Scheifler The version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly installed libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS mounted Xload has been rewritten to avoid the Subject How do I get around the frame buffer security hole On many systems the frame buffer is unsecured by default this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame buffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to accidentally start up a second X session on your console Check the man page for fbtab Thanks to Art Mulder Subject TOPIC BUILDING X PROGRAMS Subject What is Imake Imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a makefile generator that takes advantages of the include file and macro processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular Although it is not specific to X the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely Imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system specific configuration files system independent configuration files and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not There have been several different versions of imake the and versions are You can obtain information on imake from these sources the and release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X the and file mit config README also contains useful information on the tapes contrib doc imake is Mark Moraes' guide to the mit doc config usenixws contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake Paul Dubois has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non supported systems the document is available from in the directory ftp pub imake stuff look for config troff and config PostScript Some supplemental appendices are document version is now These imake papers are available by email mail a message body of send imake stuff help to see System Administration Imake Friend of Foe by Dinah McNutt in the November issue of German readers should expect in June an article Das Meta Make I make you make Schwerelos by Rainer Klute in iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazin directed at application programmers needing to write An English language derivative of this article is in The X Journal issue The O'Reilly X Resource issue contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in pub Subject Where can I get imake Versions are distributed with the and An earlier version is distributed with the release some third party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration There are no real standards for such configuration files although most current contributed software expects the templates distributed with export contains the distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire A stand alone version of Imake but one stemming from is in pub misc imake imake Subject I have a program with an Imakefile but no What to do If you have or installed on your system run xmkmf This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Then run make which will use that new Makefile to compile the Subject Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines When I try to compile certain programs I get the following link error Undefined XShapeQueryExtension XShapeCombineMask These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X SHAPE which was introduced in the MIT distribution and allows non rectangular Like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run on a server which supports Pre servers as well as many vendor supplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular windows In order to use the shape extension you must link to the library In the distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mit extensions If you do not have these files do not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the DSHAPE define from the Makefile you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor supplied X from John Melby melby Subject What are these problems with XtInherit not found on the Sun When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS or machine I get the error symbol not found XtInherit What you are seeing is a side effect of a kludge in the to get Sun shared libraries Apparently you can't share a function that is both called and compared as XtInherit This was handled by putting XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded that is in where XtToolkitInitialize and XtInitialize These routines would normally be You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X OSF Motif's UIL had this problem it called XtMalloc and other Xt The solution is to add the call to your program the function does not have to be executed just linked alternatively your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize it may be an Xlib or XView In this case you can remove lXt from your link It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the from Jordan Hayes now jordan and Danny Backx Subject Why can't I compile my Xaw contrib programs under the new X I have a program that worked well under When I try to link it under the current version of X I get this message Undefined XtScrollBarSetThumb XtTextSetInsertionPoint XtTextReplace There were several name changes in the Athena widget set in addition to the header files moving into Xaw these are mentioned in the release In this case these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt to Xaw Subject TOPIC PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES Subject Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for sic The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to In order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input To do this you must set up what are called hints for the window If your applications is Xlib based you can use something like the following XWMHints wmhints InputHint True XSetWMHints dpy window wmhints If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics you can set the XtNinput resource to be True as you probably want to in any case if you don't have source you can start up the application with the resource ' input True' Certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having this If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM true mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun Subject How do I figure out what window manager is running You can't reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any For most cases you shouldn't care which window manager is running so long as you do things in an ICCCM conformant There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these Alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features such as olwm's push pin menus in order to give your program added Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility Subject Is there a skeleton X program available There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional In X the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut paste on existing X Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just this one little thing include contrib clients xskel a simple program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks the Xaw examples in the examples directory in the and distributions and the Xlib Hello World example in the doc HelloWorld and doc tutorials HelloWorld an updated version of this program which uses Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in to by Glenn Widener of In addition a sample Xt program for Xaw or Xm by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on in contrib Subject Why does XtGetValues not work for me sic The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of Your code may be doing something like this Arg args int i int sensitive oops wrong data type i XtSetArg args i XtNsensitive sensitive i XtGetValues widget args i But XtNsensitive is a Boolean which on most machines is a single byte declaring the variable sensitive as Boolean works This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually In general you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widget's man Subject Why don't XtConfigureWidget XtResizeWidget XtMoveWidget work You're probably trying to use these functions from application They should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its Other promising functions XtMakeGeometryRequest and XtMakeResizeRequest are also for use only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry Although this will result in the widget internal functions' being called your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming The Xlib calls XMoveWindow and XResizeWindow should similarly be avoided they shouldn't be used to change XtNx XtNy XtNwidth or Subject Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves What should happen to the widget's children And by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new Note that reparenting is possible in the OI David Lewis faq Just the FAQs ma' Joe Friday David Lewis Temporarily at but not speaking for Visual day
