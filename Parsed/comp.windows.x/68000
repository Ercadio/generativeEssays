From Technical Support Subject Re Looking for X windows on a PC In article C wLIJ L K bailgate gpsemi com writes Hi All, This is the first time I've posted to the net, so I hope this is going to the right people I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by process Engineers at work May I humbly suggest DESQview X Of course, I'm biased DESQview X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard X R server as it's display mechanism DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on the fly to X protocol, allowing you to display them, or any R compatable X program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display or to any other display on the net Free tools are available for devloping X applications for the DVX platform many X programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications Often, you only need to create a new makefile If you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group comp os msdos desqview, or just email me directly at , and I'd be happy to fill you in Quarterdeck Office Systems Internet Support Tom Bortels Pricing Ordering Tech Questions BBS FAX Compuserve GO QUARTERDECK anonymous ftp qdeck com , leave your email address as password
