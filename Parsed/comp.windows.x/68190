From Casper H S Dik Subject Re imake rules problem under Solaris david levine writes Hey folks, I'm attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that has subdirs generated by imake on Solaris platforms For example, 'make makefiles' chokes in the very first subdirectory i e target subdirMakefiles not found You don't give the precise error message, but I assume that the making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules We've seen this happen with SunOS x make as well and aat this point I'm not sure why it happens It seems to happen with large Makefiles The entries near the end get lost Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem, as it does in your example In the MIT R distribution R SunOS patch this can happen with the target Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories At first I thought this was a bug with make on my Sun, but I built and used gnumake with the same results Attached you'll find the first Makefiles target rule from the generated makefile This is really weird Are your really sure that you were using GNU make Casper
