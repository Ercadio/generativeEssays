From Derek Richardson Subject Re Animation with XPutImage In article Rus John Martin writes Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into server resident Pixmap s using Once this is done the original XImages can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows Hope this is John I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display rates frames sec on IPX that I get with Sunview though it's a bit choppy at Also loading the data making an XImage then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is slower to load than with Is there a better way to load in the data rgooch Richard Gooch writes If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MIT SHM xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which yields over frames per second for bit images running on a Sparc IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for Regards Richard Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some Is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code mentioned Thanks for the help so If I get something decent put together I'll definitely post it to the Derek Richardson Tel x Institute of Astronomy Fax Cambridge E mail
