From Jon Dhuse Subject a strange problem with text Hello I am testing a port of to Coherent a unix clone OS for Intel architecture I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple terminal emulator program The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a The characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of only when the output is a series of individual If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where I should look to find it it would be much Regards and thanks Jon Jon Dhuse Internet Intel Phone Chandler Any opinions expressed are my own Chandler AZ not my employer'
