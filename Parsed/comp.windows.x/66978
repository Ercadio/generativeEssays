From mike Michael Chapman Subject Re Compiling help Here's what I think have figured All I need to do is install the disitribution without the Xserver like the file defines and all the new libraries utils will be installed and my old server from will still This will allow me to run Xview and have up and Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs Another question Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils like the file manager will be made public It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller I will NOT raise taxes on the middle Unknown
