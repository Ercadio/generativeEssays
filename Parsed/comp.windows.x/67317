From Subject X interactive performance We recently got an NCD X terminal to This is running XRemote over a serial I wanted to get some measurement of response time so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first Expose event to The program times the delay from sending the event to receiving I thought this was the simplest way to test client X server round trip It's a similar concept to the ping Is this a valid test to perform I've also tried the xbench program available from which bombards the server with graphics operations but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive response Has anyone got any ideas on this subject Andrew AT T Network Systems UK Tel Information Systems Group SUN support Email
