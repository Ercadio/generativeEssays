From tony vecchi Subject Help needed For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC tape drive and an everex full size controller in my EISA system with no I end up getting an error miscompare during the streaming read part of the I am pretty certain that the port setting irq dma are set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands rewind retension write and erase I also booted the system clean and still the same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory It has been suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do Am I going to have to accept that this set up won't work or can anyone suggest a work around I will be glad to hear your advice Tony
