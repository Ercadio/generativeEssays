From Elliot B Dierksen Subject Help with DTK I O Plus II card needed I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I O Plus II card working and it does not want to The documentation is no help at As an example it says 'The serial port can be changed to from by moving ' but does not say what jumpers to move There are banks of The first one is labeled as follows G The second bank is labeled IRQ and has the following labels I have determined that the jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as or The jumpers tell it to use the printer port as or I am guessing that the G enables the game port and the SHOULD enable the second serial port but I can't get it to I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports but I don t know Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated EBD Elliot Dierksen Is that a real I mean is that a Mexican poncho or is that a Sears poncho no foolin' Zappa W H elliot
