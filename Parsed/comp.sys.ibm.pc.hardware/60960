From gary korenek Subject Re HINT VLB ISA EISA motherboard In article C t G Brian J Schaufenbuel writes In article id XNFZ VJ gary korenek writes I believe that any VL EISA ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset is limited to bit EISA DMA where 'real' EISA DMA is bit The HINT EISA DMA has the mb ram addressing limitation of ISA For this reason I would pass I own one of these HAWK VL EISA ISA and am look ing to replace it for exactly this reason Please double check me on this In other words, call the motherboard manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true bit EISA DMA Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well I am using mine with DOS , Windows , and UNIX S R Also with Adaptec a EISA SCSI host adapter Gary Korenek You are correct The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks Brian J Schaufenbuel I don't see this as a problem with the chip set a mistake , I see this as something that was designed in intentionally So it would seem that to enhance the design from to bit EISA DMA would require an update to the chipset An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design What I'm saing is The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update This is not simple If I were you I would be cautious about this You might look into the Advanced Integration Research AIR VL EISA motherboard All slots are EISA ISA capable or of the slots are VL bus capable The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' bit EISA DMA I called them Pentium P capable Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL EISA board Look in Computer Shopper April ' The ZENON ads show the AIR mother board A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it I'm attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the AIR board Model number of AIR board with DX is B EI You can call Motherboard Warehouse for example for a price Phone 's included below AIR Motherboard Warehouse Gary Korenek Network Management Technology Incorporated Sugar Land, Texas
