From Ronald Schalk Subject dont have harddisk type Hello a friend a mine has a commodore and we've put in that machine a second harddisk he now has But the problem is that the harddisk isn't supported in the Alas there's no user type in the At the moment we use it as a type but there are getting bad blocks on the harddisk Question who knows a solution to this I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE but I haven't been able to find Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this I used these programs quite a lot in the XT days but I don't have these anymore Seagate used to ship diskmanager with each drive they Help will be greatly Ronald Schalk
