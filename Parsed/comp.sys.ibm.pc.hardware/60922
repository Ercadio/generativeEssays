From U HNYKUN URC KUN NL Ronald Schalk Subject dont have harddisk type Hello, a friend a mine has a commodore sx and we've put in that machine a second harddisk, he now has MB But the problem is that the MB harddisk isn't supported in the bios Alas there's no user type in the setup At the moment we use it as a MB type but there are getting bad blocks on the harddisk Question who knows a solution to this I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE, but I haven't been able to find this Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these programs quite a lot in the XT days, but I don't have these anymore, Seagate used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold Help will be greatly appreciated Ronald Schalk
