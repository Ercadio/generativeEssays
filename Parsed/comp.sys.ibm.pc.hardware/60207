configure DOS and Windows for use with the Adaptec However just in case something went wrong I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows working with the Also you may have noticed that installing Windows makes your PC run much slower even when you're not running Windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called Windows runs slowly MSDOS configuration The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your and If you follow the instructions you'll notice that you'll need to use double buffering with SmartDrive this is the default setup You'll also notice that your system runs much much slower in both Windows AND See the section called Windows runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system Windows configuration To get the Adaptec to work with Windows make sure that the section of the file contains the entry VirtualHDIRQ Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to but I'm not If this doesn't work for you you might want to try adding some more lines VirtualHDIRQ Off SystemROMBreakPoint false EMMExclude CFFF You probably don't need the above lines The SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM only needed if you use such programs Windows runs slowly Once you do get Windows running with the chances are that your system is running much slower than If it's not it's probably because You happen to be using version in your Congratulations this appears to be a winning You are very Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen If your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double According to the Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with you must use Smartdrive with double buffering While this works it really slows down your PC I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of FIVE As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other Unfortunately you cannot just disable double If you do Windows in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows What you can do is one of the following Use other drivers that provide double It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double buffering or by a bug in Use a driver that provides VDS services VDS stands for Virtual DMA Services This is a standard which is supported by Windows that allows bus mastering disk controllers like the to work with After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following solutions none of which require using Smartdrive note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably NOT caused by these solutions but might be see below While the following does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster If you do not have the driver or you do not need ASPI functions for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two physical hard disks you can add the driver to your file DRIVER c Windows needs the This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies about As of November the driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at hopefully it's still there If you need ASPI functions and have the driver version or you can use both the and drivers in your file DRIVER c DRIVER c Amazingly enough the driver can also be loaded high assuming you have DOS I would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn' I asked Adaptec's technical support about this and they said that loading high should be fine as long as is loaded On my system NOT using with would occasionally cause Windows to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my C WINDOWS files would be corrupted For me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from the default Windows shell and vice This is the reason may be I have absolutely no idea if is necessary with versions of earlier than Note that many people can use or without they do not seem to have any problems at I consider these people Others like me have had all sorts of In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to The driver is no longer Unfortunately while you could get previous upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the driver is not available from the Adaptec As far as I know there are only three ways to get a copy You can buy the new as of November Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit which supposedly includes as well as other drivers such as CDROM I believe the list price is around If you already have a copy of an older version of you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around A copy of is included in Central Point PC Tools for Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different Note further that only is included the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not This is where I obtained my copy of Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above However because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver related for example changing the bus on off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this I've run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems the problems show up only under disk I O However I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware Floppy controller based tape backup devices There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec with a floppy controller based tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo Tape backups restores can take a very long The tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my Tape backups restores take a long time If you have a floppy controller based tape backup device you may have to adjust the Adaptec bus on off timing for best results when using the tape Normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional However the default bus timing on the Adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to from the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to from the hard The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it The default bus timing on the Adaptec which is really DMA timing is too large For example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on off The default factory setting is microseconds on and microseconds The bus on timing needs to be lowered to This can be done in one of two ways If you have you can use the n For example I use a bus on timing of microseconds which means that I use the following line in my file DEVICE c Note that there is NO space between the n and the If you don't have your only recourse is to try to find a program called which is very difficult to The reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy I believe that there are a couple of sites that have If you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi n This adjusts the bus on timing to Running without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory Note that it seems that you cannot use if you use crashed my system if was I could use with Do not lower the bus on timing below microseconds or increase it above If you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel For me microseconds works This value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a Once you've lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run Also do not experiment with the bus on off times with the other options that I have intentionally not described unless you know what you are Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory A program called exists on the Adaptec Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked which has been a while this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on off times for the and However when I tried running this program with my my system At the time I was running and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with Maybe this old program works only with the although the docs say that it works with the Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors This problem may or may not Although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular could cause However I've heard of other people having similar problems and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape Tape backup works but the tape compare The tape drive starts stops starts stops much too Unlike the above mentioned problem Tape backups restores take a long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting stopping occurs every few seconds or Fastback Plus does not find see any tape backup Other programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo tape drive can find see the tape drive but Fastback Plus Too many tape read Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves A few months ago I upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy As I already had a floppy controller on the I initially disabled the motherboard floppy After a while I decided to try disabling the floppy controller and using the one on the When I did this the tape drive a CMS Jumbo reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus was suddenly able to find and use the tape I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the On the other hand the tape drive didn't work well attached to the floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the I don't know what the cause really is however if you're having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy Sound cards Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using Like the tape drive DMA the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card Unlike that of the tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error your system crashes with a parity error message What happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity Usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using bits instead of Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's bus on See the section on tape drives for information on how this is Note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem some software is inefficient Disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect Miscellaneous info This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about and have not I believe that the following information is correct but I'm not Use it at your own With QEMM and you need to specify the DB parameter DB unless you are using the If you don't QEMM will crash hang at Although the QEMM manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line at least this occurred with the QEMM install program I haven't tested any other version Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter but I'm not sure I've never used a version earlier than If you use you do not need to give QEMM the DB Some or all versions of the do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in To support hard disks with capacities over you need to get a new ROM BIOS from I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest being sold by To connect a CDROM drive to the you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces non SCSI these drives cannot be used with the You have three choices for CDROM drivers I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package which lists for something like If you already have older Adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around Contact Adaptec for The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you You can buy the CorelSCSI driver package which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW This package contains CDROM drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers I do not know the list price but I've seen this package sold for around Note that CorelSCSI does not come with the driver which is If you do not already have you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW kit and the ASW kit ASPI CDROM drivers You will have to get a copy of a high level CDROM driver if it is not included in the ASW kit but this is available from several bulletin To use a SCSI tape drive with the you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape Software that I've heard about are again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information Central Point PC Tools for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape It comes with SCSI drivers as well as Central Point The CorelSCSI driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program see the above section on CDROM drives for more details However note that CorelSCSI does not come with but requires I've seen advertisements that sell the in three configurations SCSI controller with hard disk ROM SCSI controller w BIOS and Adaptec ASPI SCSI controller w BIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and CorelSCSI drivers I imagine that Adaptec now sells the in a fourth configuration SCSI controller w BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers including ASPI drivers Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the driver you need this driver before you can use this program I've never used this version of GNU tar but I've heard that it works I don't know how well though If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet a copy can be found on wsmr and mirror sites Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives Adaptec Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape Adaptec ctrlr I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve UNIXFORUM might have it if any forum As far as MSDOS is concerned the and the controllers are the same with MSDOS the should work as well as the However the hardware for these two boards is not identical and there is at least one NON MSDOS program that initially did not work with a but did work with a a version of BSD Unix In case anyone's curious here's an edited copy of my file FILES BUFFERS BREAK ON
