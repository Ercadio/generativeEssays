From Marc WANDSCHNEIDER Subject Re Know anything about EISA In article qt nk Bing Ho writes I read about the development of EISA some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI However, I recently was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than mb of RAM, a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon I recall that EISA will support bit transfer among other enhancements Is there such a standard being developed Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new bit MHz intelligent bus ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like, not jumpers Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA Zorro III bus VL Bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking Toodlepip Marc 'em
