From gary korenek Subject Re HINT VLB ISA EISA motherboard In article C ovwv LM Brian J Schaufenbuel writes I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB ISA EISA motherboards with HINT chipsets Has anybody had any experience with this board good or bad Any information would be helpful thanks Brian J Schaufenbuel I believe that any VL EISA ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset is limited to bit EISA DMA where 'real' EISA DMA is bit The HINT EISA DMA has the mb ram addressing limitation of ISA For this reason I would pass I own one of these HAWK VL EISA ISA and am look ing to replace it for exactly this reason Please double check me on this In other words, call the motherboard manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true bit EISA DMA Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well I am using mine with DOS , Windows , and UNIX S R Also with Adaptec a EISA SCSI host adapter Gary Korenek Network Management Technology Incorporated Sugar Land, Texas
