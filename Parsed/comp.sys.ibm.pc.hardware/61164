From MITCH Subject Re Low Emission Monitors Who besides NEC hartzman kilroy Jpl Nasa Gov Les Hartzman writes Does anyone else make low radiation emission monitors besides NEC How do they compare to NECs quality and emission wise Les Hartzman Jet Propulsion Laboratory M S Oak Grove Dr , Pasadena, CA Les, I am right now working on an MPR II certified Swedish standards for low emissions Hitachi Superscan monitor It's x , up to hz at that res, and it got a good write up for image quality in a recent Feb issue of PC Magazine As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality at least according to the mags I can't tell any difference between the two , but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types There's VLF Very Low Frequency and ELF I think that's Extremely Low Frequency The MPR II standards set strict limits on both But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which , which claim low emissions but not specifically MPR II Compliant or MPR II Certified only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality I consis tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best , but not as low emissions as the Hitachi I like my image quality, but for all I know you may be more discerning Good luck Mitch Oh yeah I got my Hitachi Superscan from Insight for
