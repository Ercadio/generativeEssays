from eric dittman subject question about irq and irq i have an bit serial card with two ports each port has the option of
using irq 2,3,4 or 5. i also have two serial ports on a multi-i/o card,
and the ports can be set to irq 3,4,5,7 or 9. from other posts i've read,
i get the impression that irq2 on the 8-bit card is the same as irq9 on
the multi-i/o card. am i right?
