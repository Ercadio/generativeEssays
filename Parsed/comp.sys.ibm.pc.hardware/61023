From michael flood Subject cpu fans Nic Percival x wrote Just got a MHz DX system, and am considering getting a fan for the CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a stuff deleted My DX is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler This one has precision ball bearings in the motor It has a pretty substantial heat sink so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip It attaches with peel off adhesive This is a full size AT case, so the fan has gravity in its favor I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them They are powered by the slot I don't know how effective they are maybe someone else could comment The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP C unit PC Connection at has them for next day delivery The Y cord is if you don't have a spare lead off the power supply PCP C make the best power supplies available IMHO Channel R Cambridge, MA
