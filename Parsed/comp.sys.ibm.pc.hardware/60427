From Richard Krehbiel Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article Wayne Smith writes In article GRUBB writes point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi tasking Data is data and it could be anywhere on the Can SCSI find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster Does it have a better cache system I thought SCSI was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are If we are only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently faster at managing data from a hard The Adaptec series use bus This means that the CPU doesn't sit waiting for data bytes it can go off and do other computing if you have an advanced multi tasking OS that DOS just sits and waits IDE Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized Can have more than one hard Asynchronous Transfer s Why don't you start with the spec sheet of the ISA bus first You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face but if they exceed the ISA bus capability then what's the point Who says IDE is limited to megs sec What about VLB IDE Does anyone know how they perform Why don't you start with the spec sheet of the ISA bus first IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided in essence IDE is ISA on a ribbon Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA clock bit width This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL bus is a waste of a fast The card's job would to slow the VL bus transactions to ISA Heck that's what ISA slots do I'll just use one of those Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes
