From David Stam Subject Re Recommendations for a Local BUS Cache Penio Penev wrote I have a Maxtor on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is I has the save transfer rate of MB s regardless of the variations of the ISA bus I tested it with speed between and Not any The problem is not the interface between the controller and the Chris Brinton wrote I also have a and a Maxtor I have a local bus IDE controller generic and I get KB I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my transfer rate went to KB The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller transfer rate of MB I dont know how to get there from The local bus interface got me a little but certainly not as much as I had I am also looking for a way to What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter controller rate I haven't seen anything even close to the sec limit of the IDE These drives are non interleaved aren't they Here are the rates I get sequential read MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read sector blocks sequentially from outside first track inward bus bus MAXTOR sec sec QUANTUM sec sec disk buffer read same C program but re reads the same block repeatedly so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive bus bus MAXTOR sec sec QUANTUM sec sec CORETEST transfer rate seems to agree with above bus bus MAXTOR sec sec QUANTUM sec sec I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter through the controller and out the IDE Nowhere do I see anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host even though I SWEAR that's whats happening Here are some relevent quotes from the manual Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of MB s maximum s My calculations show sec maximum and sec disk spins at RPM with sectors per track on the outside and on the inside Single burst errors of up to bits within one sector can be corrected 'on the fly' in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive's I take this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck For page mode operations the data transfer rate to and from the buffer RAM is up to MB This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data transfer rate of MB s while the DCS simultaneously controls disk to RAM transfers So the thing can even do it's cache pre fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector it has read buffers for pre fetching I guess you could call that a cache So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks WHY am I getting a measly sec when I should be getting around sec Any of you hard disk engineers out there know Wondering why my disks are so slow David o o oOO OOo David Stam Linux The choice of a GNU generation un x Openlook gcc TeX FREE
