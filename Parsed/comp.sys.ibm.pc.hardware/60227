From David Todd Subject What video board for my system I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system DX mb of ram on a Novell network Monitor NEC capable of Hz vertical refresh rate Major considerations I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in I do mostly word processing database and communications not much intensive With a monitor I expect I will work mostly in and colors seems plenty but I'd like like the image to be sharp fast and rock Other considerations I sometimes run a Unix clone Coherent and I understand that some companies Diamond don't encourage the third party development of I might move to OS if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and I don't have a local bus motherboard I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later I like buying things from companies that treat their customers If you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it via email or David Todd Department of Psychology University of Massachusetts Amherst MA USA Phone Fax
