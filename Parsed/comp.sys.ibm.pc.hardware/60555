From willisw Bill Willis Subject Re HELP Installing second IDE drive In article Bill Barnes writes Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive a Seagate I can look up the model number if it's important and I've been trying to help him install I've got a vested interest since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine He already has a Seagate IDE HD again I forget the model number but I can find Anyway I can't seem to get the bloody thing I've managed to get one or the other drive up with the other disconnected but not both at the same time whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup never gets past the system The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives I think I've configured the CMOS correctly the power's plugged in properly I even learned about the master slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have didn't know PCs were into S M and I think I configured the jumpers properly the one is the master the new one is the slave The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling I've tried several combinations controller master slave controller slave master master controller slave None of them Unfortunately I can't think of any Another possibility is that the one is already partitioned into two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D drive setup info rather than drive and drive like most others I've Could this be confusing things So I need HELP The drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so it looks like a serial connection now I be lost Many many thanks in advance This is practically an emergency I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday Help William Barnes SURAnet Operations voice fax Disclaimer I don't speak for SURAnet and they don't speak for I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system up for two hard drives from the I took him at his word and I have not tried to find out any more about it because I'm not going to back everything up just to add another If anyone knows for sure what the scoop is I would like to know Thanks in advance Bill Willis
