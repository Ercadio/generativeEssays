From JASON PAUL WALTERS Subject Re GW and SIMMS In article , writes I have a gateway local bus system It has slots for SIMMS that either have to use or MB simms My question I just received a x ns simm and it has pins The slot on the motherboard has at least or so pins Did I get the wrong simm or can I still use my simm , although not all the pins on the slot would be flilled I have never encountered such a long slot for simms before Anyone have suggestions I can't get a hold of Gateway yet Thanks Please post to the net or Yes, You bought the WRONG SIMMS You need X or X , which are pin SIMMS These are better anyway becuase the send receive data in byte bit bit parity, one for each byte Chunks You will undoubtedly see these SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future Jason Jason Walters JPW LEHIGH EDU JPW PL eecs LEHIGH EDU a k a Modem Mouth
