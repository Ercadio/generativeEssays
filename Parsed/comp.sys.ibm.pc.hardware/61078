From michael flood Subject vlb scsi card suggest Satan wrote Can someone recommend a decent VESA Local Bus SCSI controller card I saw a post for the Ultrastor something or other, and was wondering if this would be a good choice I need a supported card that software like the March NT Beta will recognize BusLogic just announced the BT FAST SCSI VLB Interface as of April This always happens to me I have a one week old BT S which is the ISA version I am enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC mb ms HH RPM drive I'll be changing to the BT VERY soon, though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with the bit VESA support You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question I hear that the support is excellent I have not had to call them myself yet Regards Channel R Cambridge, MA
