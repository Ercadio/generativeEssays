From Eric F Dorondo Subject Headland Video VRAMII K ver upgrade info needed I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only came with K, at the time this was ok but I need info or help with upgrading this board to Mbyte There are rows of pins over the VRAM chips, I think for a piggyback board of VRAM I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help me upgrade this board Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please please please Does anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this I would sure love to use this in X color mode but for the time being, I can only get of the screen with the bottom part a white strip, obviously because of the missing VRAM, actually I'm surprised it even works to this degree at all As a last resort, I will wind up selling this board and probably be getting a Mb ET based dumb frame buffer This VRAMII was Editors Choice in the PC Mag So if anyone has any info, please email or as a last resort post to this group Thanks in advance
