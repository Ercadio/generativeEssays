From Guy Dawson Subject RE DX vs DX In article A , Volkert writes Anonymous, I saw a posting about the choice between DX and a DX I was wondering although a DX is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX as that one can be made to work properly with a local bus I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I O, so just get that faster I'm willing to speculate that the DX with local bus will be times as fast as the DX and probably as expensive or cheap Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a DX and a MHz local bus I'm waiting for the mezzianine sp VL bus that will be decoupled from the main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard I O cards Until the next buss spec regards, JV name J V Meuldijk o o address gildelaar hw teteringen holland e mail oOOO OOOo Guy Guy Dawson Hoskyns Group Plc Tel Hoskyns UK Tel IBM Austin USA
