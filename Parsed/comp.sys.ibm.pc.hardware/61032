From koberg Allen Koberg Subject Re DOS In article Danny Halamish writes Well I've installed DOS in three different systems with and without stacker A friend installed it in two other systems both with Not a single except perhaps some minor bugs with menus He's right ya I've helped to install Dos on about computers now mine On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter and it worked fine rather he sent in the coupon for the converter In other cases I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever Seems to work for Ofcourse we did NOT repeat NOT run any program called install or setup or a very sophisticated AI auto configuring setup installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to do but couldn't stop it from doing Well I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's Also DBLSPACE is It writes about slower than stacker reads about slower and compresses about All tests were made on the same computer with the same disk no cache and the same big files were Couldn't agree On my I don't miss the It's still faster than a normal disk read would As for the less compression I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the load before anything With Stacker any changes to your or meant rebooting twice so it could update Personally I'm waiting for Stacker to come out and implement those hooks and Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC TOOLS for sheer bells and Plus defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace But DOS is quite good reformat disks I honestly don't understand WHY you had to do koberg
