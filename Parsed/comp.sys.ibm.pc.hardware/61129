From ben elliston Subject Floppy problems Organization Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia I have a floppy drive which has developed General failure It's a Teac drive I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean However it didn't help the I've also identified that when the machine boots and the drive seeks for a boot disk the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive I'd prefer not to shell out for a new one if I can help Thanks Cheers Ben Ben Elliston Bachelor of Engineering Computer Engineering University of Canberra ooO Ooo Email V Also UUCP uunet munnari compsol root FidoNet Origin Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia
