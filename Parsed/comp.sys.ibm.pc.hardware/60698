From Mike Wende Subject Re Zeos Computers I have had a Zeos for a couple While the experience was not painless or perfect it was way better than that endured by most people I personally know who have ordered Of course several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent I got the MB Viper The first one was defective but Zeos replaced it with only minor This one works I haven't noticed any problems in any of my I also ordered it because of all the complaints about the ATI a few months Guess you can choose either buggy state of the art stuff or robust average For my particular configuration tower watt supply pkg no monitor viper the Zeos was slightly cheaper than Gateway Austin But this can change from month to Mike
