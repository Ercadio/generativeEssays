From Chris Crayton Subject Where can i buy a bios On , Ikos had the unmitigated gall to say this Ik I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix got a new hard Ik disk, discovered my BIOS doesn't have a type and I would like Ik know where I can purchase one of these things Call Phoenix They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips I had to do this when I upgraded a Emerson to an IDE drive Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it The IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual size The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in most cases WARNING Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the actual size of the drive A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but you will be sorry if you go even one byte over Drive damage will not result, but headaches will Backup not found A bort R etry P anic Blue Wave QWK v The Ozone Hole BBS A Private Bulletin Board Service Full Service Nodes USRobotics K bps Gigs , Files SKYDIVE New Orleans RIME Network Mail HUB Usenet Newsgroups Please route all questions or inquiries to
