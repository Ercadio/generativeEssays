From jiml Jim L Subject Re SIMM Speed In article hkok cse Kok Hon Yin writes Robert Desonia wrote B BK Is it possible to plug in or SIMMs into a motherboard saying BK wants simms You shouldn't have I have heard of machines having problems with slower than recommended memory speeds but never It should run without any trouble of course but why do you want to buy some and mixed them with is more expensive than and furthermore your machine will run the slowest SIMMs clock speed eventhough you have Just my Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to CMOS is set to usually wait states regardless of what speed RAM is No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call failing as a sort of auto This is how you can sometimes use slower RAM in a You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM in which case all memory will run at that slower rate or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow JimL Mailer address is buggy Reply to jiml James Lewczyk NCR MPD Fort Collins CO
