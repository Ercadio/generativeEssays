From Subject bit DMA Failure System halted I have a Mhz ISA Board with kbyte Cache and Megs RAM I just bought the new soundblaster and tried to install the card The sb uses bit DMA channel I could select between channel to It is the first card I ever installed that uses bit dma transfer After I tested the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a parity error system halted This happens either from dos as also from windows So it seems that my bit dma channels are not working properly they are there because testsb exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only bit dma channel but it makes the system slow Thanks for your help Yours Markus
