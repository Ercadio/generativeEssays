From Wolfgang Mueller Subject Q Internal modems without uart Seeing all these questions about uart types their availability and their relative merits wouldn't it be fine if for internal highspeed modems there were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and instead accessing directly the relatively large send receive buffers of the modem thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies Just an idea Wolfgang Mueller Computing Centre Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf
