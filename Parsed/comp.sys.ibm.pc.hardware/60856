From Robert Scholten Subject Re How hot should the cpu be The temp on my DX is over C measured with a K type thermocouple and Fluke dig thermometer This is an idle temp not doing lots of bus i o, not doing floating point, not doing bit protected mode etc This is in a Micron computer, without heatsink I recently put a heatsink fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off It makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc Rob Scholten
