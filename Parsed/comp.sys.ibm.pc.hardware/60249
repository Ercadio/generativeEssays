From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI DXB writes In article GRUBB says In PC Magazine April Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI faster than IDE and support up to devices its acceptance long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re Where do they get those numbers I'll list the actual performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd SCSI I ranges from SCSI II ranges from IDE ranges from ESDI is always s although there are some non standard versions ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI with a SCSI controler chip range is indeed s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI With a SCSI controller chip s with s burst bit Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI so it DOES Some PC use this set up SCSI bit SCSI mode s with s burst SCSI bit wide or fast mode s with s burst SCSI bit wide AND fast s with s burst By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct With a SCSI controller chip SCSI can reach s which is indeed faster than IDE of is ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac IBM info sheet available by FTP on sumex in the info mac report as mac ibm compare version It should be but may still be there Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI chip Not at a s s burst it does SCSI is s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI interface and think 'SCSI ' when it maybe a SCSI interface driven in the machine by a SCSi controller chip in bit mode Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI can go Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going One reference for the Quadra's SCSI controller chip is Digital Review Oct
