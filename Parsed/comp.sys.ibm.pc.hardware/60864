From Ken Nakata CIS stnt Subject Re VL bus HDD FDD controller or IDE HDD FDD controller In article Richard Krehbiel writes In article Beng Hang TAY writes Hi I am buying a Quantum MB hardisk and is deciding a HDD FDD Is bit VL bus HDD FDD controller faster than bit IDE HDD FDD controller card No VL bus IDE is no faster than ISA The IDE interface is fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus and if you hook it to VL bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two meaning ISA It's not IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its IDE bus signal timing doesn't have to be same to ISA signal My VL IDE bus card has a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from sec up to sec the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as milion byte sec and milion byte sec respectively You cannot transfer data at a rate of sec on the ISA I hear that the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller On the other hand I wouldn't expect it to be slower Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes Ken Nakata I apologize if there are incorrect rude and or impolite expressions in this mail or They are not Please consider that English is a second language for me and I don't have full understanding of certain words or each nuance of a Thank Ken Nakata CIS student NJIT
