From Ken Nakata CIS stnt Subject Re VL bus HDD FDD controller or IDE HDD FDD controller In article A Richard Krehbiel writes In article Beng Hang TAY writes Hi, I am buying a Quantum LPS AT MB hardisk and is deciding a HDD FDD controller Is bit VL bus HDD FDD controller faster than bit IDE HDD FDD controller card No, VL bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE The IDE interface is fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if you hook it to VL bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two, meaning ISA speed It's not true IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its IDE bus signal timing doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing My VL IDE bus card has a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from MB sec up to MB sec the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as milion byte sec and milion byte sec respectively You cannot transfer data at a rate of MB sec on the ISA bus I hear that the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller On the other hand, I wouldn't expect it to be slower Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes along Ken Nakata I apologize if there are incorrect, rude, and or impolite expressions in this mail or post They are not intended Please consider that English is a second language for me and I don't have full understanding of certain words or each nuance of a phrase Thank you Ken Nakata, CIS student, NJIT
