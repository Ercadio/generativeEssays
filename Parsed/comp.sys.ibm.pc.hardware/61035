From Kin Chan Sparrow CMU EDU Subject Floptical drives anyone Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on Remember those Mb disks that look and feel like floppies These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both Kb and Mb disks Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD ROMs which are currently not rewritable I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer My question is why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals Just a thought Kin Chan sparrow cmu edu
