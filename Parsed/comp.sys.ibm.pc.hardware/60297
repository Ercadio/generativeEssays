From Scott Mace Subject Re IDE vs SCSI here we go In article Wayne Smith writes In article Eric Smith writes SCSI is better because it has a better future and it has a lot of minor advantages right IDE cards are cheaper right now but will be obsolete in a few In fact IDE cards are so cheap they might as well be The real cost is in the IDE SCSI cards cost more but they are worth I almost got a hernia laughing at this You'll probably get one when you realize that your vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local It actually slows down your system Bus It must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another for a SCSI Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus IDE is Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi whatever intels spec VLBUS it not good for much more than vga To each his I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you spent for your little ide drives and then finding out you need more The biggest advantage of SCSI right now is that you can add more different kinds of devices such as tapes easily and can add bigger The best and most cost effective hard disks available are Here Only of you need drives larger then Oh yes gotta have megs sec transfer rate for those speedy tape backups and cd rom don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing I'd rather wait a second compared to the minutes and ide would obviously exaggerated Have you ever tried to backup gigs of disk Oh I forgot you can't because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that Basically if a person has to ask which one is better for him her then they will probably never see the EXPENSIVE benefits from I guess you probably bought a too Also all this arm waving about SCSI expandability is a moot point if the user only has one or two drives on And with SCSI those two drives may be fast but that speed is only due to the onboard memory cache something I can duplicate with a caching IDE What The SCSI FAST WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide Stop this thread now Its just cluttering up If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet the best SCSI FAST WIDE etc is clearly faster than any the best ide All the response given are based upon personal experience with or You can't judge such completely different IDE has the low cost adavantage a descent SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and neither one is better in all If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick up a back issue of PC week in whihc they tested vlbus eisa and isa busmastering send flames to dev Scott Mace internet
