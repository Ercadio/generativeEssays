From STBW Subject Western Digital IDE HD's What are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives I seem to have found a really good bargain on a drive but I thought I'd check if anyone had any comments to say on this make Also I'm a bit of a novice with PC's but an experienced computer user when connecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare bays what extras will I need a cable for starters I guess but what about brackets Also I think I might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original Connar I'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate IDE socket on my controler What will I need to change Yet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that answer me in the future Me the artist has produced all this with my own imagination and Oi Yes you at the back stop laughing is Mirrir Skippy Jase Pick
