From Will Estes Subject Mounting CPU Cooler in vertical case I just installed a CPU in a clone motherboard and tried mounting a CPU cooler on the After about hour the weight of the cooler was enough to dislodge the CPU from its It ended up bending a few pins on the CPU but luckily the power was not on I ended up pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU cooler back So far so Have others had this problem How do you ensure that the weight of the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case Will Estes Internet
