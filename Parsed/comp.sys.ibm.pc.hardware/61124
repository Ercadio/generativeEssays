From tfisher Tom Fisher Subject Re CPU Fans the attached fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential loss of cooling if the fan goes at least with the power supply fan you can reach back there every few days and feel the fan Yes this is a valid concern With the directly attached fan units I've seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at In other words if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop working A suggestion Slave hook in series a small pilot light off the fan Then if the light goes out you know your fan is not Tom
