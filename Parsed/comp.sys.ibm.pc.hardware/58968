From Jens Ejvinson Subject Re Is MB sec HD transfer slow for DX EISA with UltraStor F In A Haktan Bulut writes Hi I recently switched my old Amiga with a DX My computer configuration is DX Mhz kB EISA Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA Mhz MB Ram ST N MB Harddisk, SCSI UltraStor F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer about kb sec and sometimes MB sec Is that good I thought that with EISA I could get about MB sec Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host adapters need to perform a low level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system, do I need that A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about MB sec, and he has an ST A and a ISA DX , how can a ISA with the same system be faster Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk Dont rely on benchmarks They often show incorrect due to different TSR programs SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is x faster You can disable disconnect and get some kB s but just to loose the mouse or other int s when diskaccesing I get MB s with DX LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT SY Coretest I get MB s Sysinfo Jens Ejvinson Nackstavagen C VII Internet Asyvan Solace hsh se S Sundsvall SWEDEN Tel ACT Sweden Fax Nope Advanced Computer Technology BBS Not yet
