From Jim J Jim Johnson Subject CPU N P Just got a system and am considering getting a fan for the N P The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a N P fairly good long ago when I did some electronics training I read N P somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions gates etc N P slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot N P chip goes off spec sooner N P Has anyone out there got a CPU fan I work for a small PC We offer both a personal and professional system Our pro machines always have a CPU cooling fan on and DX N P Is there more than type There are several N P Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan Sometimes depends on the specific fan N P Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines All the ones I've seen do many come with a 'Y' connector so you don't have to have a spare N P Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans N P Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money Touch a chip after its been running a few minutes you won't feel the fan is a waste N P How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese Depends on the Many use clips make sure you use heat sink grease or heat transfering tape or you will have wasted your N P Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without an advert I've read claims vs Tough to tell I do know the chip sheds a lot of SLMR Murphy was an optimist Is your data backed up Via DlgQWK
