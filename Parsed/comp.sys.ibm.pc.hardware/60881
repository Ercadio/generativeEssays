From Jim J Jim Johnson Subject CPU Fans N P Just got a MHz DX system, and am considering getting a fan for the N P CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a N P fairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read N P somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions gates etc N P slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature, hence a hot N P chip goes off spec sooner N P Has anyone out there got a CPU fan I work for a small PC OEM We offer both a personal and professional system line Our pro machines always have a CPU cooling fan on DX and DX units N P Is there more than type There are several manufacturers N P Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan Sometimes depends on the specific fan model N P Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines All the ones I've seen do many come with a 'Y' connector, so you don't have to have a spare connector N P Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans None N P Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money Touch a DX chip after its been running a few minutes you won't feel the fan is a waste N P How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese Depends on the model Many use clips make sure you use heat sink grease, or heat transfering tape, or you will have wasted your money N P Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without an advert I've read claims F vs F Tough to tell I do know the chip sheds a lot of heat SLMR a Murphy was an optimist Is your data backed up Via DlgQWK v a
