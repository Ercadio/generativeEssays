from bing ho subject know anything about eisa i read about the development of eisa some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in vesa and pci. however, i recently
was disheartened to hear that isa cannot address more than 16mb of ram,
a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon. i recall that eisa-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements.
is there such a standard being developed? -- bing ho university of california at berkeley
