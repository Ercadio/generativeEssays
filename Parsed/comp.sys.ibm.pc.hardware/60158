From Jerry Shekhel Subject Tape Backup Question Hello folks I have an Archive internal QIC tape drive which is pretty comparable to the Colorado Jumbo Since I have two floppy drives in my system I'm using a small card not accelerated made by Archive to attach my tape drive as a third floppy The problem Although the DOS based QICstream software works just fine both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non turbo speed I'm using a EISA Since the DOS software works it can't be a hardware problem can it Has anyone seen similar problems Any solutions Thanks in JERRY SHEKHEL Molecular Simulations Time just fades the pages Drummers do Burlington MA USA in my book of In rhythm Guns N' Roses
