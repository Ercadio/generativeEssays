From andrew Andrew Klossner Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings These disk controller are call There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership disk controller and keyboard There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership it will share an interrupt with another device In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an This is due to a screwup in the bus For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number then it must hold a certain bus wire to or at all times depending on whether or not it wants an This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single Andrew Klossner
