From Kenneth Robert Ballou Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings In article Paul Bartholomew writes In article andrew Andrew Klossner wrote These disk controller are call There are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership disk controller and keyboard There are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership it will share an interrupt with another device In a standard ISA bus the one that almost all non laptop PCs use two separate interface cards cannot share an This is due to a screwup in the bus For example if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number then it must hold a certain bus wire to or at all times depending on whether or not it wants an This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt it's because they're implemented by a single Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ successfully I assure you that they are both set to IRQ and that I have no My computer is a DTK IBM First Andrew is correct although I can see where there might be some It is indeed possible to have two cards configured to use the same They can not share the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same Here is an For some time I was short of free I had a tape controller not a floppy tape that needed one of It's an old tape My solution was to use also used for where my modem is I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape When kermit runs it installs its own interrupt handler for and uses the serial If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt kermit would not have a clue what to do with for the tape And since the tape controller would not be serviced it would most likely Likewise when the tape backup software runs it installs an interrupt handler for That handler won't do anything for the serial Under DOS printing is NOT interrupt Instead the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be That's why you can have your sound card and both configured to use Try that on NT and see how far you'll Kenneth Ballou VOICE Oberon Software FAX One Memorial Drive Cambridge MA Internet The views and opinions expressed above are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my
