From Nicki A Stassen Lantz Subject HELP LED connectors for motherboard I bought a DX motherboard for no documentation at all Everything appears to work, except I'm having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors working I've looked at the manuals for other motherboards, but the pin configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board Does this pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there Any hints on where I can find this information speaker keylock J The board came with a jumper vertically across these two pins I can get the power keylock to work across pins , reset across pins and , but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation The date on the board itself is , opti chips I would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance N A Stassen Lantz
