From Thomas D Barrett Subject Re Rockwell Chipset for 's Any good In article im u c camelot Joe Zbiciak writes What's the word on the chipset Is this a ROM bug specific to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell chipset itself There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much expected with any FAX modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU as opposed to the DPU for an internal implementation This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a interface Without the interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions like in windows As far as I know, the speed buffering works OK for external modems if a is used on the internal serial port board Hope this helps Tom Tom Barrett TDBear , Sr Engineer v AMD PCD MS E Ben White Austin, TX f don't take no take hold don't leave it to chance Tasmin Archer My views are my own and may not be the same as the company of origin
