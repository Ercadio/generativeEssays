From David Engel Subject Re Wanted Opinions on MAG S and NANAO i monitor sleeping dragon wrote I'm looking to buy a monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what monitor I should buy I have a MAG S this is a dpi version and it using a TRINITON tube and a NANAO i in mind Good luck finding an MX S When I was looking around back in December January, Mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get tubes from Sony I asked when they expected to restart production as I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX S but they said not any time soon I wound up getting a T i and am extremely happy with it David David Engel Optical Data Systems, Inc E Arapaho Road Richardson, TX
