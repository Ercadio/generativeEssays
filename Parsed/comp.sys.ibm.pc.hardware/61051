From Mark Jackson Subject Re Chaining IDE drives In article badry Badry Jason Theodore writes I am trying to set up a Conner and a Quantum I have the conner set to the master and the quantum set to the slave doesn't work the other way around I am able to access both drives if I boot from a floppy but the drives will not boot I am running MSDOS and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos and is formatted with system I have tried all different types of setups and even changed IDE controller If I boot from a floppy everything works great except the booting part The system doesn't report an error message or anything just hangs Does anyone have any suggestions or has somebody else run into a similar problem I was thinking that I might have to update the bios on one of the drives is this possible Any suggestions answers would be greatly Please reply to Jason Badry Make sure that the hard disk you want to boot from is set as active using the FDISK program that comes with DOS Mark
