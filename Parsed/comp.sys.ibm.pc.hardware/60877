From Dan Ts'o Subject Re Monitors In article C pIsw K The GIF Emporium writes NEC FG or now also available the NEC FGe only difference, no ACCUCOLOR Any experiences or opinions from people who have used the NEC FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after my exams are all done ie about a week from now I have a FG and think it is great I haven't seen the Nanao's so I can't compare, but the FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is extremely good I've used other Trinitron monitors e g a Sun SS color monitors, which is a Trinitron , and think the FG is at least as good, perhaps brighter, and has none of these silly horizontal lines running across BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the FGe is slower as well as missing ACCUCOLOR It may not be able to handle x the way the FG can Cheers, Dan Ts'o Div Neuroscience Baylor College of Medicine Baylor Plaza S Houston, TX
