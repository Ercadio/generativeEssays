From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI DXB writes SCSI I ranges from SCSI II ranges from IDE ranges from ESDI is always s although there are some non standard versions The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI SCSI I bit asynchronous s ave synchronous s max transfer SCSI faster this requires a SCSI controller chip and provides SCSI bit to bit speeds with SCSI SCSI s with s burst bit s with s burst bit and s with s burst bit wide and fast bit SCSI can be wide or fast it depends on how the port is designed The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI non wide port The article in PC Mag was talking about SCSI SCSI uses TEN devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI devices slower through put From your own figures SCSI is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for faster then IDE that seems to be bit SCSI using a SCSI contoler chip The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI controler chip for its SCSI and gets s through put for asynchronous bit SCSI far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI output of is which is near the burst of a SCSI machine with a SCSI controller The PC world seems to have SCSI and SCSI mixed Fact is SCSI controler chips allow near SCSI speeds through a SCSI device As shown in the Mac Quadra which skews some of the data of SCSI vs IDE or ESDI I agree that the article COULD have stated that the faster then IDE came off a SCSI device with a SCSI Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI NOT SCSI and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI device with a SCSI controller SCSI chips are limited to MB SCSI devices with SCSI chips becoming common produce up to s in bit mode and s in bit mode the fast version SCSI ports cannot use wide SCSI Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI devices HAVE SCSI chips or more accurately the machine does This allows the best of BOTH worlds high SCSI speeds and cheeper SCSI costs FULL SCSI hardware port electronic controller etc is VERY It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about even if it does not tell HOW the figures came about while DXB is throwing out ranges that don't tell SQUAT Since he IGNORES SCSI devices with SCSI chips his ranges tell even LESS then
