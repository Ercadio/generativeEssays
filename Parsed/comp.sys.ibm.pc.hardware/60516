From Niels Skov Olsen Subject Re Rockwell Chipset for 's Any good Thomas Barrett writes In article camelot Joe Zbiciak writes What's the word on the chipset Is this a ROM bug specific to a specific brand using the Rockwell or is it the Rockwell chipset itself There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much expected with any FAX modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems so you'll have to get it from someone Someone Else could you please comment on I have just bought a Twincom which has a Rockwell It wasn't cheap so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU as opposed to the DPU for an internal This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a Without the interface the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions like in windows As far as I know the speed buffering works OK for external modems if a is used on the internal serial port Phew I was lucky The Twincom internal version has a and one of the Rockwell chips is marked But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware Niels
