From Peter Desnoyers Subject Help with fixed frequency VGA monitor I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for that will do non interlaced which seems like a good However it is a fixed scan rate monitor and only handles kHz horizontal I With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes and not much use since just about any application will set the mode to something else especially if it wants to do text I Anyway is there any way that I can use this as a general purpose VGA display with a meg trident card if not can I do so with some sort of different VGA card Peter Desnoyers
