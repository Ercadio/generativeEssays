From Allen Mulvey SUNY Oswego NY Subject Re Memory Slot Problem In article ralf Ralph Valentino writes I finally decided to upgrade my EISA's memory from Meg to Meg two months after the parts warranty ran out on the Anigma motherboard two months too It seems there's a problem with one or both of the two sim slots in bank On boot I get a pattern test failure at address and the system deconfigures the top The sims are good I tried rotating all of them into bank On one of the configurations however the pattern test failed at In all tests the pattern that appeared was the same as the pattern if no sim was in This leads me to believe the one or two of the connector address pins are at fault and with a lot of luck might be Ralph Ralph Valentino Hardware Engineer Worcester Polytechnic Institute Center for High Performance Computing Marlborough MA Many motherboards have jumpers to enable disable the memory Did you check that out Allen mulvey
