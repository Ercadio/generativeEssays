From robert k nichols Subject Re how to search for bad memory chips In article N s B w w c cat UUCP david c cat UUCP Dave writes i came upon this idea i would like to share with everyone to check for bad memory chips create a boot disk with emm himem sys and ramdrive sys in the config autoexec bat boot the PC to create a RAM drive as large as possible use a disk repair utility I use NDD Run it on the RAM drive, yes it will run, its only a device driver run or so passes, they go very quick if your machine fails, there is a definate bad memory chip if your machine passes, there is a conflict with programs you are loading in memory It's an interesting idea, but the worst case data patterns developed to test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect common faults in memory chips Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
