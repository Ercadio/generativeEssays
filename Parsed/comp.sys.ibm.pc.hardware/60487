From John Bongiovanni Subject Re Date is stuck Barry Sardis writes Kevin O'Gorman writes Anybody seen the date get stuck I'm running MS DOS with a menu system alive all the time The machine is left running all the time Suddenly, the date no longer rolls over The time is reasonably accurate allways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning This involves exiting the menu system to get to DOS I've started to notice the same thing myself I'm running DOS and Win so I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel At times it is the date, at others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should be Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a clock, has to make a Get Date system call Apparently, the clock hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this date advance automatically The Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set, and then then advances the date Anybody with more info John Bongiovanni, Systems Analyst, Orbital Engine Company, Perth, Australia , Opinions expressed are my own and not those of my organisation
