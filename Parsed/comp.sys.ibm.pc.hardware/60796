From lonewolf muse Corp Sun COM Peter Pak Subject Motherboard advice needed Hi, Does anyone have a source for DX Motherboards I've been calling around the local stores and everyone appears to be only stocking the DX or SX motherboards How difficult is it to modify a DX motherboard to run at MHz Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a slower part Thanks Peter
