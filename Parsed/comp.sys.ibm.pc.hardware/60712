From Terje Thoegersen Subject Re Problems with Toshiba CDROM In article A , Imad M Jureidini writes Hi I recently purchased the Toshiba CDROM I own an Adaptec B SCSI card, and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS It works very well under OS , so I know that the drive is not faulty In my config sys, I have aspi dos sys, aspidisk sys, aspicd sys In my autoexec bat, I have MSCDEX, which came with DOS MSCDEX seems to find and install the drive as drive F , but when I switch to that drive and try a dir, I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something like that The CDROM is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem to recognize that I have a CDROM at that point Has anyone ever had this problem Is there something abvious that I am missing And finally, I was wondering if anyone using this setup could kindly post his her config sys and autoexec bat Hi One of the ASPI drivers I think it's the ASPICD supports a NORST paramter, which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads This fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec tosh Regards, Terje
