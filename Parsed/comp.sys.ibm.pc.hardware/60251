From Yoda Subject Re Booting from B drive David Weisberger writes I have a drive as drive A How can I make the system boot from my B drive Optimally, the computer would be able to boot from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk But if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that it can't boot disks, that's OK Also, boot b won't do the trick for me Thanks, Davebo You can try to get into the setup byt pressing CTRL ALT INS or CTRL ALT PrintScreen on most PC's That should give you an option to set regarding the drives to boot from
