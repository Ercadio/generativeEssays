From david c Dave Subject Re Run box w o cover Tim Biernat writes i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding extended operation of my with the cover removed from the there are a of reasons i am considering this including quick access to jumpers during complex i o card my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the cooling flow of air from the fan hot spots may develop on my motherboard or my has intake air vents in the front of the enclosure right at MB These vents would be removed along with the top cover in this scenario rendering airflow from the fan pretty however short periods in this mode don't seem to heat things up too much but my conclusions are far from tim I ran a out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no major effects yeah no case at all MB sitting on a static bag other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty as for cooling problems I bought a inch fan and turned it on full and set the output directly on the I did finally get a case though and I am still running the parts with no ill I also had no kids to spill things on the MB I had no cat leaving hair on the MB on and the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the MB cool enjoy David China Cat BBS c cat mimsy anagld c cat david
