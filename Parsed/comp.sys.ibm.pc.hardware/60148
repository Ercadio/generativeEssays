From Subject Re Original IBM PC specs In article writes A hard drive with XT type controller can be added but I recommend not trying a full height hard drive as I have run into trouble with the supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard disk on a watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from the floppy drive than turn on the pc you will notice the hard drive having a real difficult time getting up to speed but it when booting is finished plug in your floppy drive now it will ok I know this is not very user friendly maybe you are better off buying a with watt power supply or something like that willem
