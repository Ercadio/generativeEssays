From R v Kampen Subject Re Original IBM PC specs In article A writes A hard drive with XT type controller can be added, but I recommend not trying a full height hard drive, as I have run into trouble with the w supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard disk on a watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off buying a with watt power supply or something like that willem
