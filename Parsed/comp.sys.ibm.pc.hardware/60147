From Subject Re ISA to EISA In article B B S writes In article Shawn Casey Hello I have a question for anyone that may be familiar with ISA and EISA sytem After I switch the ISA boards into the EISA board all of the cards are ISA the system seems to work with no problem what so But some of the interupt problems that we had with the ISA board continue with the EISA Is it my understanding that the EISA board should be able to handle IRQ conficts when running Problem When running our network via telnet tcp ip with windows running the system kicks us out of windows IRQ confict within windows I assume Also are there any memory address problems that will happen when the boards are switched base memory that is As far as I know if you are using EISA mother board you have to use also EISA cards or else your computer system will be slower than when you're using ISA board with ISA Bill That's nonsense You can use ISA cards in an EISA system without problem and at the same speed as in an ISA system Luke
