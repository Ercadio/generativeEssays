From Mike Levis Subject rd CFV and VOTE ACK comp os os programmer porting,setup,multimedia,bugs Attention voters I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting Please check the Vote Acknowlegement ACK at the end of this CFV If your name address is not there, please send your vote again Actually, check even if you voted after the first day Introduction This is the third and final Call For Votes CFV for the creation of four OS newsgroups and the renaming of one a create comp os os programmer porting unmoderated b renaming of comp os os programmer to comp os os programmer misc unmoderated c comp os os setup unmoderated d comp os os multimedia unmoderated e comp os os bugs unmoderated This is the second attempt at creating comp os os programmer porting and comp os os setup, and renaming comp os os programmer to comp os os programmer misc The first attempt failed in the summer of the voting deadline was August , The voting rules state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started after a six month waiting period in this case, it is March , This is the first attempt at creating comp os os multimedia and comp os os bugs This document contains the background showing the need for these proposals the proposed charters for these proposals voting instructions a voting ballot some example ballots the voting rules the voting schedule the Mass Acknowledgement Background The creation of two, free, bit compilers for OS x gcc and emx gcc read comp os os programmer for details has spurred a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and much more Borland has released its C C compiler for OS x, allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and later, Windows As more people are discovering OS x, the number of people asking questions about OS 's compatibility with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware, installation procedures, etc Multimedia is becoming popular OS supports Windows Multimedia Extensions using Win OS Furthermore, IBM is including direct multimedia support in OS starting with version in addition to using Win OS Any non trivial software will have bugs OS is not exempt, especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks e g the Service Pak for free free from BBSs and ftp sites, or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes read comp os os misc for details Proposed Charters a create comp os os programmer porting unmoderated It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and spur additional development The group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms such as DOS, Windows, UNIX, etc , toolkits which aid in program portability including porting tools such as Mirrors , and so forth b rename comp os os programmer misc unmoderated To keep the structure of the OS newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal, comp os os programmer should be renamed to comp os os programmer misc comp os os programmer misc will still be the newsgroup for OS programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of OS in an unmoderated setting c create comp os os setup unmoderated It will be devoted to OS system setup topics, including the availability of device drivers, compatibility information, installation procedures, system requirements, and overall performance optimization d create comp os os multimedia unmoderated It will provide a forum for discussion of multi media issues e create comp os os bugs unmoderated It will provide a forum for OS system bug reports, bug diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system patches and corrective service disks, and so forth Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS betas belong in comp os os beta How to Vote To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e mail it to me Many

Example Ballot a comp os os programmer porting yes b comp os os programmer misc yes c comp os os setup no d comp os os multimedia e comp os os bugs no f voter's last, first name Smith, John In this example, John Smith favors comp os os programmer porting to be created, and comp os os programmer to be renamed to comp os os programmer misc He also opposes the creation of comp os os setup and comp os os bugs He does not have a view on the creation of comp os os multimedia Example Ballot a comp os os programmer porting yes b comp os os programmer misc yes c comp os os setup yes d comp os os
