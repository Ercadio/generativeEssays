from mike levis subject rd cfv and vote ack comp os os programmer porting,setup,multimedia,bugs attention voters * i had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.
* please check the vote acknowlegement (ack) at the end of this cfv.
* if your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.
* (actually, check even if you voted after the first day) introduction: this is the third (and final) call for votes (cfv) for the creation of four os/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one: (a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) (b) renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) (c) comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) (d) comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) (e) comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) this is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. the first attempt failed in the summer of 1992 (the voting deadline was august 31, 1992). the voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is march 1, 1993).
	this is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	this document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the mass acknowledgement


background:

	the creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for os/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  borland has released its c/c++ compiler for os/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software.

	much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos, and
	later, windows.  as more people are discovering os/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about os/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	multimedia is becoming popular.  os/2 2.0 supports windows
	multimedia extensions using win-os/2 3.0.  furthermore, ibm is
	including direct multimedia support in os/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using win-os/2 3.1).

	any non-trivial software will have bugs -- os/2 is not exempt,
	especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os/2.
	so far, ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the service pak) for free (free from bbss and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


proposed charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  the group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as dos,
		windows, unix, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		to keep the structure of the os/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for os/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of os/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		it will be devoted to os/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		it will provide a forum for os/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in os/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]


how to vote:

voting rules:

	* one vote per person.  if you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* do not ask how the votes are going.  the status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* i will acknowledge votes by mass acknowledgement (ack).  i will
	  post the ack twice (see schedule below).

	* if you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  also see the ``how to create a new newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* if you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  cfv, send me e-mail at .

	* when the voting period is over (see schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of yes votes exceeds the number of no votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. yes >= no + 100, or yes - no >= 100).
	  2)  the number of yes votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of no votes (i.e. yes >= 2 * no, or yes - no >= no).
	  in other words, a proposal passes if:
	      yes - no >= max (100, no)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


schedule:

	the voting period started on march 29 when the first cfv was posted
	by david lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	this third cfv is a repeat of the first cfv, but it also has the
	mass acknowledgement (ack) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  if you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	the voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (central time), on
	april 24, 1993.  votes received after that time will not count.
	the voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.


mass acknowledgement:

	here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots
