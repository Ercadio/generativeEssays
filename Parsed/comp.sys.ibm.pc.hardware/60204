From William John Christie Subject Re Joystick suggestions It depends on what you'd like your joystick I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my I have heard on that they don't last well less than a year on One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the I recently purchased a CH There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Works quite The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it The buttons provide good tactile response you can hear and feel them well There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for here compared to the I paid for a CH I think the extra is worth it just in Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input only up down left instead of 'how much right' you might want to look into a Gravis They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond Will Christie AATCHOO PHILOSOPHY the principles and University of Manitoba Uh science of thought and reality Winnipeg MB Canada I'm leaking PHILOSOPHER someone who thinks chrstie brain they're useful to society
