From R A Schrack Subject Re Modems and UARTs In article jester GUN de michael jester GUN de Michael Gerhards writes Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally, the older boards have a or UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received The UART has an internal byte buffer, so with the right software installed it generates an IRQ every chars close Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Is it necessary for k or higher throughput If you ran dos, you don't need a , because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the interrupts, you will still lose characters I have one machine with an external bps modem attached and can't drive the serial port any faster than k without losing characters Michael Michael Gerhards Preussenstrasse Germany Neuss Voice Rob Robert A Schrack Systems Administrator SalesBook Systems Voice Tobey Village Office Park, Pittsford, NY Fax We wrote the book on Sales Force Automation
