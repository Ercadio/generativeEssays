From jbayer ispi COM Jonathan Bayer Subject Re Problems with Toshiba CDROM Imad M Jureidini writes Hi I recently purchased the Toshiba CDROM I own an Adaptec B SCSI card, and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS It works very well under OS , so I know that the drive is not faulty In my config sys, I have aspi dos sys, aspidisk sys, aspicd sys In my autoexec bat, I have MSCDEX, which came with DOS MSCDEX seems to find and install the drive as drive F , but when I switch to that drive and try a dir, I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something like that The CDROM is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem to recognize that I have a CDROM at that point The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba you should get the Corel SCSI drivers, which do support it This is the method that I used, and it works well Corel's phone number is Just a satisfied user JB Jonathan Bayer Intelligent Software Products, Inc Winthrop Rd jbayer ispi COM Edison, NJ
