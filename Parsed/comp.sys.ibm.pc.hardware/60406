i have just upgraded my machine with a 200mb ide ( and custom controller
mdl ci-1010 extended ide controller ) while maintaining my rll'd wren as
master drive. the trick is the controller which supports up to 4 ide drives
while coexisting with existing controllers ( mfm,rll,esdi,scsi ). so according to the documentation it should work with esdi, and i can assure
you it works with rll. bruce powell email:
