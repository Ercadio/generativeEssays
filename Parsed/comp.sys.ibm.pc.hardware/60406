From Bruce Powell Subject Re ESDI with IDE Yes it should be Possible, In article A , G Chow writes In article qegfd Guido Leenders writes Hi, Is it possible to use an ESDI controller with HDD together with an IDE harddisk controller in one ISA system I've read stuff about secondary controllers Does this trick work Thanx in advance, Guido I have the same question as Guido It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as I have just upgraded my machine with a Mb IDE And custom Controller Mdl CI Extended IDE Controller While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as master Drive The trick is the controller which supports up to IDE Drives while coexisting with existing Controllers MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure you it works with RLL Bruce Powell email
