From MOHIT K GOYAL Subject Re IDE vs SCSI How do you do bus mastering on the ISA bus By initiating a DMA Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they don't use the motherboards on board DMA which is MUCH slower ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or I forget Their are DMA channels in an ISA are bit are The system uses DMA a SoundBlaster uses DMA I could buy a busmastering XGA video card a busmastering SCSI In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems I do know that on EISA MCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA
