From Chris Crayton Subject modems and noisy lines On , Juan Carlos Leon had the unmitigated gall to say this JCL I just got a problem, I have a cheapo bps modem which I use to JCL connect to my university, but I get too much garbage on the screen I JCL do know it's because the noise in the line I can actually hear it JCL So my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate JCL this garbage , my modem doesn't have any of these on hardware, can a JCL software implemented protocol do the trick There is a software version of MNP available from MTEZ, and it will often connect with other modems that are MNP compatible, but if the modem that you are connecting to doesn't support MNP then it won't help Error correcting modems will eliminate line noise, but only id there are error correcting modems on both ends of the conncetion The added soeed is much worth the price of error correcting modems baud V bis modems are very reasonable, and they are only about slower than the more expensive , modems on the market My hard disk is full Maybe I'll try this message section thing Blue Wave QWK v The Ozone Hole BBS A Private Bulletin Board Service Full Service Nodes USRobotics K bps Gigs , Files SKYDIVE New Orleans RIME Network Mail HUB Usenet Newsgroups Please route all questions or inquiries to
