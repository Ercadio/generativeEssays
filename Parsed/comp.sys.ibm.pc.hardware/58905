From Andrei Yakovlev Subject How to program a PC Keyboard itself Hi All I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non trivial data to the KB as opposed to standard NumLock On Off typeamatic from inside the PC software I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the PC KB Anyone have any ideas Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn't look too neat besides what would one do from an XT Great thanks in advance
