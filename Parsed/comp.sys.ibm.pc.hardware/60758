From Carsten Grammes Subject List of IDE Harddisk specs Configuration of IDE Harddisks last update collected by Carsten Grammes and published regularly on There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or I only collect I do not check for myself There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware Since I hope however that only well minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability If you should agree or disagree with some setting let me know immediately in order to update the If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and or jumper settings please mail them to me for the next update of the list Only IDE AT Bus Harddisks will be accounted If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it Another statement maybe right IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and The precomp is a built in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board often only a jumper number means the jumper '

be set as described in the relevant product I a single drive environment the drive is described as a In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing There are four links and adjacent to the way interface They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the way interface LED When fitted this jumper connects the LED drive to pin of the This allows a LED to be connected to the An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of Ohms ot Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single It fallows communication across the way interface connector indicating to the Master drive the presence of a Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive greater than MBytes per second when using This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than MBytes per There are four possible Master Slave configurations in which a drive s may be jumpered Master single drive with LED on interface Master single drive without LED on interface only Master dual drive without LED on interface Slave dual drive without LED on interface No jumpers Master dual drive with LED on interface Slave dual drive with LED on interface only The Master drive will delay power up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are The other connections for a LED will be found close to the way connector at the other end
