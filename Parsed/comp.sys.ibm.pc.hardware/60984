From lonewolf muse Corp Sun COM Peter Pak Subject Re Motherboard advice needed Maybe I should have been clearer I have a Intel DX that I would like to use to put together a system however all the motherboards that the local vendors are now selling are running either at or MHz I guess I can cross my fingers and hope the CPU runs at that speed I think I'll take Mark's advice and see if any of the boards have a socketed oscillator and head down to the local electronics store Thanks for the info B
