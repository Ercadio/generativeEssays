From Kenneth Almquist Subject Re or grayscale displays Below is the list of large at least inches diagonal monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible I've omitted Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a Khz horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards at boot up My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've studied it The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship to reality Kenneth Almquist cut here Cornerstone Technology Concourse Dr San Jose, CA DualPage Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS DualPage Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Ikegami Electronics U S A , Inc Brook Ave Maywood, NJ DM AD Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Price Compatible with PC Image Systems Corp K Tel Hopkins, NM or M LMAX Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac M LV MAX Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Price Compatible with PC PS Mac M PMAX Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac M PMAX Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac Nanao USA Corp Telo Ave Torrence, CA FlexScan Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac Ran Ger Technologies, Inc Address unknown The Genuis Model M Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC Sampo Corp of America P O Box Atlanta, GA ImagePRO Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Price Compatible with PC OfficePRO IIe Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Price Advertized pg April Shopper Compatible with PC Samsung Electronics America, Inc Address unknown You could try Samsung Information Systems, Inc N st St San Joes, CA PageMaster MU A AM Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC Mac Sigma Designs, Inc Bayside Pkwy Freemont, CA L View Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac L View Multimode Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price Compatible with PC PS Mac MultiMode Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price min Compatible with PC SilverView Diagonal inches Max Resolution x Frequencies Khz horizontal, Hz vertical Dimensions x x inches Price min Compatible with PC PS Mac
