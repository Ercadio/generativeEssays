From Andreas Kuehnel Subject Delayed Write Caches I'm using Norton Cache , which is really nice but horrible incompatible Some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows doesn't like it at all But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only NCACHE is really fast You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed But to write files the FAT must be changed only once Is there any cache program out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my applications Any help is really appreciated
