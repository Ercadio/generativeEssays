From William Ng Subject Re Q SCSI IDE or more hard drives In article Bill Barnes writes Has anyone successfully put both SCSI and IDE hard drives on the same system I would like to know as well since I just bought a Seagate IDE drive and want to add it to my computer a four year old Gateway which currently has an Seagate SCSI The SCSI controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS setup both hard drive settings are listed as Not installed and apparently the SCSI controller works its I wondering if this is a Also I remember how when I helped my cousin install his second IDE drive we had to define a master slave relationship for them do I need to do something similar here I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the boot Same Any help would be appreciated since I intend to install this drive ASAP I'd like to know what to do and what not to do before I Thanks I have been using both IDE or MFM and SCSI drives for I have IDE and SCSI on one system and the other with IDE SCSI disk and SCSI I currently using ALWAYS SCSI card but I also have a Future Domain a Western Digital SCSI card and I work with an ADAPTIC As I recall all these cards can support boot and floppy However to use with other controller IDE the boot drive has to be the IDE or MFM You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the If you guys only have drives IDE SCSI just set up the IDE in your CMOS Make sure you can boot from Then set up the SCSI controller IRQ DMA etc Set the SCSI drive to ID Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so Only if you have more than drives then you need driver for the third drive and so If you have more question email me I will try to answer Good Luck William
