From Phil Culver Subject Re DOS I have a clone with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba mbyte Since installing DOS when I tried to re install software from or disks when I mount the disks DOS doesn't recognize that I have changed If I do a DIR I see the contents of the previous The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed is to do a label and then to not label Buying DOS has been a colossal DOS was stable and worked well with my I have Superstor Pro and DESQVIEW X with QEMM Manifest etc so there aren't any features of DOS that I am I guess I should roll back to DOS but I am wary of what will happen when I do Besides like a fool I don't have a DOS bootable disk I've made the same mistakes I caution my users not to Like sheep I joined the crowd flocking to DOS Baaa Baaad system Phillip Culver Silicon Graphics Inc View CA
