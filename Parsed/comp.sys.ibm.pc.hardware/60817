From Phil Culver Subject Re DOS I have a DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba mbyte drive Since installing DOS , when I tried to re install software from or disks, when I mount the second third fourth disks, DOS doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies If I do a DIR , I see the contents of the previous diskette The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed, is to do a label , and then to not label them Buying DOS has been a colossal mistake DOS was stable, and worked well with my equipment I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW X with QEMM, Manifest, etc , so there aren't any features of DOS that I am using I guess I should roll back to DOS but I am wary of what will happen when I do it Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS bootable disk anymore I've made the same mistakes I caution my users not to make Like sheep, I joined the crowd flocking to DOS Baaa Baaad system administrator Phillip Culver Silicon Graphics Inc Mtn View, CA
