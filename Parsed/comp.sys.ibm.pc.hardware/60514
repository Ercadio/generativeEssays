from fast eddie felson subject trident cs drivers for win hello i've got an old trident 8800cs svga card, but lacking suitable drivers
for windows 3.1. the drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible.

ftp-site would be nice. thanks in advance jouni _______________________________________________________________________________
