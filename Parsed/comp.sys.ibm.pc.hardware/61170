From Subject Re card shows up as with 's address and IRQ In article writes I have an internal modem that I configure as with IRQ but when I insert that card into my DOS PC it shows up as with and 's address When I get into debug and dump the data at it shows the address as belonging to even though the modem should be at This is a common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers and users for example is simply the third equipped COMM port not necessarily the one with I O address The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port The first equipped port it finds will become If you're playing by the rules you can't have a unless you have a The set of standard whatever that means port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I O address space in its search for serial So what you have is indeed at the non standard address Were this address in the table slot instead programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but COMM ports Frankly I don't know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
