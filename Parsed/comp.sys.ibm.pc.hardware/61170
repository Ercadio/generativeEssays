From robert k nichols Subject Re COM card shows up as COM with COM 's address and IRQ In article C x FE CIE genesis nred ma us writes I have an internal modem that I configure as COM with IRQ , but when I insert that card into my DOS PC, it shows up as COM , with IRQ and COM 's address E When I get into debug, and dump the data at , it shows the address E as belonging to COM even though the modem should be at COM This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers, and users alike COM , for example, is simply the third equipped COMM port, not necessarily the one with I O address E The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses The first equipped port it finds will become COM , etc If you're playing by the rules, you can't have a COM unless you have a COM equipped The set of standard whatever that means port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I O address space in its search for serial ports So, what you have is indeed COM at the non standard address E Were this address in the th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but COMM ports installed Frankly, I don't know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with this Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
