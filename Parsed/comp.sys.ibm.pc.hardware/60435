From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI Richard Krehbiel writes Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated clock bit width If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the s sighted for IDE come from SCSI is not It is just the way the industry uses and talks about There are THREE key differences in SCSI the controller chip the port and the THAT IS Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand SCSI asynchronous and synchronous modes SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only s s synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi divices with a rewrite of the software driver As is the case for the Mac SCSI bit THIS is the main source for the This differs from SCSI ONLY in the controler chip in most In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI ' because it uses SCSI ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI SPEEDS through SCSI INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous Average speed in asynchronous SCSi mode s with s See in both Quadras and higher end PCs Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate MB s SCSI bit TWO versions Wide Wide SCSI requires TWO things over bit SCSI a SCSI software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external Fast SCSI also requires TWO things over bit SCSI SCSI driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support bit fast SCSI Speed of both is the same s with s SCSI bit Also know as Wide AND Fast Over bit SCSI this requires SCSI driver software wide SCSI port and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a bit mode SCSI As expected this is VERY Speed s with s bursts As I said Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the controler chip and the Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE the chip and the port
