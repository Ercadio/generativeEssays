From Thomas Dachsel GERTHD mvs sas com Subject BOOT PROBLEM with IDE controller Hi, I've got a Multi I O card IDE controller serial parallel interface and two floppy drives , and a Quantum ProDrive AT connected to it I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from it I can boot from drive A which disk drive does not matter but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch, the LED of drive A continues to glow, and the hard disk is not accessed at all I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I o card or floppy disk drive settings jumper configuration Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it Please reply by email to GERTHD MVS SAS COM Thanks, Thomas Thomas Dachsel Internet GERTHD MVS SAS COM Fidonet Thomas D Subnet UUCP in Germany, now active Phone work , home Fax Snail SAS Institute GmbH, P O Box , D W Heidelberg Tagline One bad sector can ruin a whole day
