From Steve Harrold Subject Quantum LPS A hard disk phantom seeks Quantum LPS A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a MB Quantum hard drive, model LPS A, and have a concern about its behavior Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I O, it performs what I call phantom seeks When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every seconds, lasting seconds This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not the drive My other hard disk, a Seagate ST A, does not have this kind behavior Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon Steve Harrold HPG
