From Mark Ashley Subject Re IDE vs SCSI I almost got a hernia laughing at this one If anything, SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local Bus IDE It must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a SCSI drive, then pay another for a SCSI controller First off, with all these huge software packages and files that they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me Mb limit Second, rumor is Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI and will support it soon I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes I hear a good cohesive set of SCSI drivers Mark Ashley DISCLAIMER My opinions Not Harris' The Lost Los Angelino
