From JMARTTILA Fast Eddie Felson Subject Adaptec problem Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec Problem Floppy disk drive doesn't There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk Unfortunately I have located only one of them in the lower front corner I would like to know if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are Problem My hard disks refuse to With my two SCSI HD's Rodime Miniscribe I get a message 'Missing operating system' even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS DOS version This might of course be due to incombatible memory Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors Thanks in advance Jouni Jouni Marttila Yo kyl B Turku FINLAND jmarttila finabo abovax jmarttila PGP key available via finger
