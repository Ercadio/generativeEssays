From Guy Dawson Subject Re IDE vs SCSI DMA and detach In article Wayne Smith writes In article Richard Krehbiel writes Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS I might need an SCSI controler rather than an Will performance suffer that much For a or so drive If I don't have a tape drive or CD ROM Any help would be So when you've got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you One way is with DMA or bus Either of these make it possible for I O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the The alternative is for the CPU to move the There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus How do you do bus mastering on the ISA bus IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes with no If we're talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have DMA channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single So even though you can have at least devices on a SCSI bus explain how all of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA AT bus at the same Think It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a This frees the SCSI bus for other This is typically used in a multi tasking OS to start transfers on several While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered This is typically a second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer Also I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book but from their PC technical manual page The FDD adapter is buffered on the bus and uses the System Board direct memory access DMA for record data I expect to see something similar for the PC AT HDD So the lowly low density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC AT HDD controller doesn't That makes real Guy Dawson Hoskyns Group Tel Hoskyns UK Tel IBM Austin USA
