From Geoffrey Sherwood Subject Orchid vs Fahrenheit mini review I just purchased a Viewsonic and and Orchid In short I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card so that is what I am going to write The monitor is The moires I had under Simcity on my Magnavox went It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be lbs I think So much for the On to the bitch session and test In going with the modern trend the Orchid card only supports colors in mode without a Of course this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes like most of my CD ROMs The Compudyne Whiplash VGA Orchid Fahrenheit and Orchid VLB all share this Those are all cards which means it is an problem for them the uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia though which the cards just printed as hash which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are The supported resolutions really annoy You can do at if you tell the driver you have an NEC they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic' and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL But at you are limited to Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do at it sure should be able to do it at Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid VLB I currently have and it will do Hz as The higher graphics modes all crash HP I just got off the phone with Orchid and with the drivers I don't know what I have he was unable to recreate the On the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the He didn't know why they limited the refresh to Hz The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card but they were close to half of the OFVLB ie slower but that was running in a ISA so the numbers aren't really The following numbers were all obtained using a MHz AIR motherboard UMC chipset with MB I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a K means thousand not M means million pixels per second Orchid Fahrenheit VLB Orchid Chip Weitek DIB to Screen Memory to Screen Screen to Screen Vector solid Vector styled Polygon shaded Polygon hatched Ternary Rops Font The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the Awesome Interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie filled with cross hatching and Ternary Rops whatever they Graphics operations like XORs maybe are a dead loss on the I give two numbers for the fonts because I think they are When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly the speed of the Then the speed increases Sounds like programming to a benchmark to I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at Its just what I saw when I ran them on my I normally don't write disclaimers but this time maybe I'd My testing is totally unconnected with my work I program under UNIX on Decstations is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my geoff sherwood
