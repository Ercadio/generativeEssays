From Tim Biernat Subject Re Jumbo Backup Problems In article writes I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo tape backup unit in my Gateway Tower I have found the supplied backup capability to be fairly In approx cases out of I have had the backup fail at one point or another often hanging in the middle of writing the Seek errors drive communication errors seem to be most I use the DOS backup software from Colorado Memory Should I return the drive get some better backup software reformat the tapes am using CMS tapes Any hints would be appreciated this stuff is to time consuming to do over and over again until it i've been using an identical setup except for the tower config for several months from previous discussions on the net the first thing to check for is DMA conflicts with other devices especically if you've got any funky next off suspect your tape try a fresh good luck tim
