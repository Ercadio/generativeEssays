From ben elliston Subject CPU Temperature vs CPU Activity Organization Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the claim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive job is running My friend claims that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a computationally intensive From what I've seen in coursework most CPUs never actually idle They will continue to service interrupts The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's I suppose depending on the instruction the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment the surface of the package will be Cheers Ben Ben Elliston Bachelor of Engineering Computer Engineering University of Canberra ooO Ooo Email V Also UUCP uunet munnari compsol root FidoNet Origin Compact Solutions Canberra ACT Australia
