From Wayne Hodgen Subject Re Weitek P Future Plans In article A COM robert weitek COM Robert Plamondon writes In article q n pINN Wayne Hodgen writes To sum up, when an accelerated board with MB VRAM True Colour x AND A FAST VGA SIDE is available under , I will buy one Me too What's funny is, when we really CAN buy such a product, it probably won't seem as mouth watering as it does today What No holograms Get outta here I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card It does x but only colour You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough One of the odd things about the computer industry is that, since you can always wait and get something better, some people wait forever I know people who have deferred updating their original IBM PC for a decade, because every time they look at what's available, they see something better coming down the road I know people who've dumped their PCs into the garage, but haven't replaced them, because they're afraid it isn't the right time to buy They just gave up using computers I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing For instance, I'll be upgrading my to a DX EISA, VLB board RSN The performance difference under Linux is great enough to be worthwhile At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller I'll be buying an S card 'cos they're fast enough, I have X drivers for them and it'll have MB VRAM just like a Weitek card It will also be MUCH cheaper When affordable MB cards arrive, I'll buy one Personally, my system at home needs a new disk subsystem, a much larger monitor, a super fast graphics board by you know who, a new CPU board I probably won't keep much more than the case and the mouse Come to think of it, I don't like that mouse very much So when will I buy When my dream products hit the market NO WAY I'm gonna buy as soon as I have the MONEY Over the last year I've done much the same But now I need a monitor, more memory MB just ain't enough , a GB disk GB and no space left Oh well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year Wayne Hodgen Opinions c Me Intel SX Uni Koblenz, unido infko hodgen Keeper of the Scrolls, Just Rheinau , Voice Defender of the Net, say Koblenz Fax His name is root NO
