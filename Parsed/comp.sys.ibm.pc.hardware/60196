From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI Wayne Smith writes What does a meg megs sec SCSI drive cost Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with s and Hard drives START at I have NO For the Mac I have the following These are ALL external MB MB MB MB MB MB MB etc So scsi SCSI for the Mac goes down in price MB as hard drive size goes up and I assume the same for the PC I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multi tasking OS's when managing data from a single SCSI hard Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive In the Mac since SCSI is THE inteface for any non card non modem not keyboard device the id is used for the floppy drive called CPU in all This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle it this shows up best in the Quatra line In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage' CD ROM IDE seems to be mainly hard As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I can't find Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface Make of that what you will SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of This alone puts SCSI above SCSI blows IDE out of the Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about months ago When the Mac prices came down to Earth so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose In bit and bit mode SCSI is a multi tasking OS desined interface while IDE and bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces at least the way mac use bit
