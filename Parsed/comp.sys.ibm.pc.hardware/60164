From Peter Geltner Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings In article qjv Nicholas Vargish writes A SoundBlater SB card is supposed to share IRQ with LPT parallel printer interface , and in general this scheme works well However, sometimes there are conflicts it seemed to depend on the software more than anything else Origin games are especially bitchy about having the WHOLE interrupt to themselves My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ , which is unreserved in contemporary computers using IRQ for the drives went out with the XT architechture DON'T put the SB in IRQ if you have an XT, get a new computer instead This IRQ has been completely stable for me, and I use my SB to play mods and wavs under Linux a free UN X for or better PC architecture machines with no problems, as well as games under DOS I also use IRQ But there is one disadvantage Some games assume that the board is using IRQ and have no way to adjust this setting I had trouble with some of the Lucas Films games Peter Geltner Administrative Dean of Computing Santa Monica College Santa Monica, California
