From Michael Paull Subject DX Chips I have a DX motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up I'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know if i can use a DX Mhz cpu The BIOS is late model AMI, circa , and the system crystal is approx Mhz My question is, can i just replace the original MHz cpu with the new DX cpu If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling devices such as heatsinks and or muffin fans Mike
