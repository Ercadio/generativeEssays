From Dan Subject Re BusLogic questions In article Tiger Zhao writes MOHIT K GOYAL writes Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS beta I believe so since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very reliable in OS The BusLogic cards have an OS driver that does work with the March Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS any If you wish to install the beta from the CD ROM you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS attempts to use Thanks Adaptec So you add the BusLogic drivers to the on the CD ROM boot disk and REM out the Adaptec Then you install the whole half of the and it won't work IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once Thanks IBM REM out the Adaptec drivers once and If you have everything in the right it will Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the except OS will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the you are off to more REM statements and more The BT comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with The DOS drivers work This card can easily be configured to work with different sets of I O ports and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine If you get a new it will also be able to support up to GB drives under Hope this Dan Dan Galpin
