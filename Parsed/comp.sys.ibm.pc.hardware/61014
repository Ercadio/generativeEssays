From Liz Camarra Subject Re Hercules VLB In article A Geoffrey Sherwood writes That is for my wife I just purchased a Viewsonic for myself, and am looking for a graphics card to drive it I want Hz refresh, and would really like it to handle my CD Roms I tried the Orchid P , which did neither of those things though Robert at Wietek did say that the Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base So my thoughts go back to Hercules They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the Graphite around the end of March I have heard precisely ZERO about it since then Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities and price it has Hmm your CD Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they have quite a back order right now the megs version will come out a bit later Since you have a Viewsonic I think it has a khz horizontal frequency right , you're gonna love the megs version It can do x x at Hz, x x at Hz, x x at Hz , x x at Hz It can also do x x mil and x x bit at Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours most of those modes need a khz monitor, otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate If you want more info about the coming Graphite VL, you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve IBMHW , in the video sig There're several Hercules reps there that are very helpful Stephen Lau, Elec Engineering, Univ of Hawaii don't have my own account until grad school starts autumn Death to FM synthesis Go Gus
