From DONALD A O'SHALL Subject Re Original IBM PC specs In article C JD J I , R v Kampen writes In article A wr ites A hard drive with XT type controller can be added, but I recommend not trying a full height hard drive, as I have run into trouble with the w supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard disk on a watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off buying a with watt power supply or something like that willem The newer the drive, the less problem you will have The old ten and fifteen meg full heights were power hogs, but I have over twenty units that I set up running flawlessly with half height drives and or hard cards DAo NS CC LEHIGH EDU Don
