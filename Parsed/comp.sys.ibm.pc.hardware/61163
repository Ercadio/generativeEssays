From Scott Linn Subject Re Gateway DX V too high a price Glenn Koh writes Then again, maybe for the gateway system isn't too cheap I have a system from Micron computers , meg ram, Maxtor HD, Local bus IDE meg video card, and the same monitor The system with shipping came to I sold the sx chip that came with it and bought a dx Total price I think you got something wrong here You state that the system was a dx , then say that you sold the sx chip that came with it This does not make sense Scott Linn
