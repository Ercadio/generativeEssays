From wayne bradley Subject hp lj i fonts I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet The nameplate does not specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he has a LJ I His problem is a tax program which requires a cpi font to print the forms properly This unit came to market in versions The plus version supported dowloadable fonts You can guess which one my friend has the plain, not the plus The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction of cartridges including a cpi but none with a cpi font Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a or cpi font Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable cost Any suggestions would be welcome Thanks WinQwk b Seattle Rain Festival Jan to Dec Canada Remote Systems Toronto, Ontario
