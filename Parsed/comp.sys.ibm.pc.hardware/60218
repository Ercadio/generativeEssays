From Martin Erzberger Subject Re Monitor for XGA In A writes my home Viewsonic I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them in modes like x x k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like x x Oh yeah I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday to replace my old , and I tried it with x This mode is just great I can get four perfectly readable command windows on the screen And if I need more colors, I can go back to x or even x One thing I am wondering though Why isn't there a MONxxxx DGS file which contains ALL the resolutions up to x Now I have to change the XGASETUP PRO every time I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS Regards, Martin Erzberger
