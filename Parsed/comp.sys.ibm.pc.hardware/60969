From Denis Lambert Subject Any comments on Gateway's Nomad I am looking at getting a laptop for work and I was trying to decide between the Toshibas and Gateway's The price is about the same but the Gateway has significantly better performance hard drive and much cheaper accessories extra batteries The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad Thanks Denis Lambert
