From Linda Distributed Language Subject help with et hicolor modes Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET with a bit dac I am trying to use the x x M mode under unix so i cant just call int h I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register d h index is apparently set to x , but d h index the displayed clocks is set to xEF, so x is nonsense A resonable value would be x so is there a high bit, and if so, where is it Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency and what would be an appropriate frequency The documentation isn't really very clear tseng txt from vgadoc zip from some ftp site about this My card is a MegaVga Mb card Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios ver I think Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix linux in all the non hicolor modes Great for running X windows in up to x x ni if your monitor will take it only just in my case Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often Thanks very much, David
