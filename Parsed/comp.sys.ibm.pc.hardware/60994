From Geoffrey Sherwood Subject Hercules VLB A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite A pretty nice Fairly fast and seemed quite compatible even seemed to handle the SVGA modes I have whined about here on At the time I was just buying a VLB system so after checking out the card I sent it I wanted a VLB card and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB This card is fairly fast will do Hz refresh at but is not compatible with my CD ROMS the SVGA thing I think I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have I have not gotten a straight answer out of The monitor I am using it with is a Magnavox which also tops out at Hz so its really a pretty good That is for my I just purchased a Viewsonic for myself and am looking for a graphics card to drive I want refresh and would really like it to handle my CD I tried the Orchid which did neither of those things though Robert at Wietek did say that the was possible if I modifed the driver data base So my thoughts go back to They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the Graphite around the end of I have heard precisely ZERO about it since Does anyone know if the card was actually released and what capabilities and price it has Any info would be most Geoff Sherwood
