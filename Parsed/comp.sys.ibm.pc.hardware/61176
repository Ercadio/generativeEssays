From Alexander Lerman Subject Tower Without a Fan I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was I got several useful suggestions, but was the most seductive run your PC in silence by removing the fan altogether Two variables I always run my PC without the cover, and I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference Should I try to run my PC without a fan I know it sounds like utter folly so I'm asking has anyone done this succesfully Or tragically You're answer may save my PC Thanks Alexander Lerman voice
