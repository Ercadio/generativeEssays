From Narm Gadiraju Subject modem I have a IBM clone with two serial ports com , com and mouse port Both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board I tried to install a buad Hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work Once I dial any number the system locks I do not hear any click or ring before it the system hangs The modem has a pin dip switch to select the appropriate port Once I change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again Then I bought a baud Hayes external modem and checked the system It works fine with both the serial ports The internal modem has been checked on another machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine Can anyone please help me to find the problem thanks Narm Gadiraju
