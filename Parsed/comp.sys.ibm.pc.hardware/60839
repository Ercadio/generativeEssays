From Chris Crayton Subject Netware server a and s On , Wayne Mcdougall had the unmitigated gall to say this WM The software is Netware Level II and I can see burnt on to the WM screen SFT Netware Level II V a However, to configure netware WM for level II mirrored or duplexed disks requires a second disk, yes Yes Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two disks at once Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses two controller cards and two disk drives Duplexing requires a special card and two identical disk drives in most cases Duplexing can sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives controllers, as long as the sizes are the same WM So how is the Novell Server A normally configured The configuration is completely up to the user WM Can I install SFT Netware Level II V a as Level I, or is this WM what is causing my serialization error If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT However, the OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error Make sure that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the NetWare installation set WM Is the Novell Server A normally equipped with two hard drives, WM one of which has failed Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume mirrored using SFT II Impossible to tell with the network being down WM Would this mean I can not install the network software because it WM will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and installing the software as one volume under SFT I If the software will install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work in this configuration WM What else can cause a serialization error See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation floppy WM What happens if the keycard fails What is the keycard attached to Line noise provided by South Central Bell Blue Wave QWK v The Ozone Hole BBS A Private Bulletin Board Service Full Service Nodes USRobotics K bps Gigs , Files SKYDIVE New Orleans RIME Network Mail HUB Usenet Newsgroups Please route all questions or inquiries to
