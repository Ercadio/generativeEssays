from subject hayes external ac pins hello, i have a hayes moden with no cables or manuals. the
modem requires a source of 14v ac, but i do not know how
to connect the power source to the 3 pin connector. i know
that the top pin is the ground, so i would guess that the other
two are the ac pins, right? if you have any hints, please
e-mail me, i really need help... thanks!!! duc n.
