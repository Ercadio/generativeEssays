From Dennis Lou Subject Re CPU Temperature vs CPU Activity In article Guy Dawson writes In article Lino Montuno writes This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the claim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive job is running My friend claims that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a computationally intensive It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing I'm not sure about DOS but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this loop is there anything to do YES do it goto loop NO goto loop The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing I've done some ASIC and digital design but not any CPU It would seem to me that on a the FPU is not being used most of the cache is not being accessed the off chip buffers drivers are idle the multiplier isn't multiplying the barrel shifters aren't shifting microcode isn't microcoding This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated in CMOS which means less From what I understand the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat Dennis Lou But Yossarian what if everyone thought that way Then I'd be crazy to think any other way backbone ucsd dlou dlou Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went to my high
