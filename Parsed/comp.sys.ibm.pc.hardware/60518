From Yousuf Khan Subject Re IDE vs SCSI here we go In Scott Mace writes In article Wayne Smith writes I almost got a hernia laughing at this You'll probably get one when you realize that your vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local It actually slows down your system Bus It must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another for a SCSI Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at Mhz and Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus We've seen IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times it was a bit standard running at somewhere near When you run an IDE off of the VLB there's no way that you're running it at Mhz it would burn Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever none of them run at CPU The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching I suspect it would be much much better to get a software disk cache instead since you get write caching as because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as Yousuf Khan
