From Yousuf Khan Subject Re IDE vs SCSI here we go again In A Scott Mace writes In article A Wayne Smith writes I almost got a hernia laughing at this one You'll probably get one when you realize that your vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks If anything, SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus It actually slows down your system Bus IDE It must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a SCSI drive, then pay another for a SCSI controller Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at Mhz and bits Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a bit standard, running at somewhere near Mhz When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at Mhz, it would burn up Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write caching as well because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as G Yousuf Khan
