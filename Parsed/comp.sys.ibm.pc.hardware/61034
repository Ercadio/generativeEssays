From Randy Ellingson Subject SCSI or IDE The Bottom Line Which would YOU choose, and why Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive Right now I have a ms Mb IDE drive Seagate A , and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the Mb to Mb range And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit I believe I'm getting something like Kb sec transfer right now according to NU How would this number compare if I bought the state of the art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state of the art SCSI hard drive the best system I could hope for Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top of the line IDE caching controller for my Mb, ms HD And how much would it cost Thanks for any comments Randy
