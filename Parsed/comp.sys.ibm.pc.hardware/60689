Subject Re DOS From Wallace Venable I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS That's of the people I know with DOS Both have had to reformat their disks and start over I used the standard installation program to put MS DOS on my machine with Stacker already installed No problems I kept Stacker, rather than switch I am very pleased with the memory I gained since I did not have a memory manager I also like the multiple boot feature
