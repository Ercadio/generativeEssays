From Michael B T Michael B Taylor Subject new gig SCSI rpm drives Ratings I've noticed a recent proliferation of gig SCSI drives, in particular, the Fujitsu and the Micropolis There is also the Maxtor LXT s rpm, gig drive They are all quite cheap, and have nice year warranties My questions are Is there a catch Which one is better What type of SCSI do these drives use Is the service generally better for one of these manufacturers Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason thanks, Michael Taylor
