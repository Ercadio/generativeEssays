From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI Wayne Smith writes I just bought at Quantum for my mac at I paid for I haven't seen IDE drives A friend of mine just got a Maxtor meg IDE drive for that's million bytes or mega bytes With the basic interface he gets close to meg sec transfer on his Does your figure include a few hundred for SCSI drivers Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI for hard drives YES the figure includes a hundred for SCSI drivers This is sloppy people and But on that point is it faster This is what all this is Do you get more performance for the Ok once again with the SCSI spec list SCSI with a SCSI controler chip synchronous range is indeed s asynchronous range is slower at SCSI With a SCSI controller chip s with s burst bit Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI so it DOES Some PCs use this set up SCSI bit SCSI mode s with s burst for those who want SCSI but don't want to pay for the bit or bit hardware or mess with the SCSI software Usable by SCSI devices with close to bit SCSI speeds SCSI bit wide or fast mode s with s burst SCSI bit wide AND fast s with s burst On the other interfaces let DXB speak IDE ranges from Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower Range s ESDI is always s although there are some non standard versions One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI AND SCSI Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote My comments in PC Magazine April Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI This is asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip faster than this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip AND bit SCSI To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip Although asynchronous SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI one third the speed of or asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip or bit SCSI Although SCSI with a SCSI chip and bit SCSI are eight times as fast as ESDI faster than NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by This eliminates SCSI drivers are somewhat reasonable while bit and bit SCSI drivers are VERY expansive bit SCSI can use SCSI drivers with little speed degridation the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI or SCSI or SCSI over all SCSI AND SCSI IT DOES MAKE A
