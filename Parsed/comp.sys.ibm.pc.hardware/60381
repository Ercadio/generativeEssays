From GRUBB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI Wayne Smith writes I just bought at Quantum for my mac at home I paid for it I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper A friend of mine just got a Maxtor meg IDE drive for that's million bytes, or mega bytes With the basic interface, he gets close to meg sec transfer on his Does your figure include a few hundred for SCSI drivers Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI for hard drives YES the figure includes a hundred for SCSI drivers This is sloppy people and DUMB But on that point, is it faster This is what all this is about Do you get more performance for the money Ok once again with the SCSI spec list SCSI with a SCSI controler chip synchronous range is indeed MB s asynchronous range is slower at MB s SCSI With a SCSI controller chip MB s with MB s burst bit Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI so it DOES exist Some PCs use this set up too SCSI bit SCSI mode MB s with MB s burst for those who want SCSI but don't want to pay for the bit or bit hardware or mess with the SCSI software controllers Usable by SCSI devices with close to bit SCSI speeds SCSI bit wide or fast mode MB s with MB s burst SCSI bit wide AND fast MB s with MB s burst On the other interfaces let DXB speak IDE ranges from MB s Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower Range MB s ESDI is always MB s although there are some non standard versions One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI AND SCSI Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote My comments in PC Magazine April , Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, This is asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip faster than IDE this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip AND bit SCSI To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip Although asynchronous SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the speed of IDE or asynchronous SCSI with a SCSI chip or bit SCSI Although SCSI with a SCSI chip and bit SCSI are eight times as fast as ESDI, faster than IDE NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself This eliminates ambaguity SCSI drivers are somewhat reasonable while bit and bit SCSI drivers are VERY expansive bit SCSI can use SCSI drivers with little speed degridation the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI or SCSI or SCSI over all SCSI AND SCSI IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE
