From Donald Yee Subject Re Tape Backup Question In article A Jerry Shekhel writes Hello folks I have an Archive XL internal QIC tape drive, which is pretty comparable to the Colorado Jumbo Since I have two floppy drives in my system, I'm using a small card not accelerated made by Archive to attach my tape drive as a third floppy device The problem Although the DOS based QICstream software works just fine, both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non turbo speed I'm using a DX EISA Since the DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it Has anyone seen similar problems Any solutions Thanks in advance Yeah Sounds typical Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware, and therefore your machine can't keep up with things Ever notice how when acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl I imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time, and sometimes the backup program loses Be glad I can't even run in medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI machine which places extra demands on the data bus don
