From Dave Olson Subject Re How much should I pay for a SCSI cable with or connectors In T y B Dan Jones writes Also, I seem to remember a posting saying that the SCSI spec calls for foot between devices on the cable, but most cables you get internal don't meet the spec SCSI II Draft Proposal, Rev h, Section Single Ended cable, which is in the Cable Requirements Section, has an implementor's note Stub clustering should be avoided Stubs should be spaced at least meters apart For the non technical, stubs are SCSI devices However, also be aware that Implementor's notes are basicly recommendations, they are NOT part of the spec As others have noted, many vendors including SGI violate this Indeed, the main point is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and therefore 'noise' on the bus Let no one tell me that silence gives consent, Dave Olson because whoever is silent dissents Silicon Graphics, Inc Maria Isabel Barreno
