From Andreas Kuehnel Subject Windows Virtual Memory I've got a DX , MB and I'm using Windows Sometimes I wondered why Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing execpt having lunch or something like that Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free And so I'm still wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the convertional is sufficient Any common sense explanation is really appreciated
