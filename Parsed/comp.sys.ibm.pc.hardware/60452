From Bob Blean Subject Re Which high performance VLB video card In article A BrockU CA , BrockU CA Tim Ciceran writes PC Magazine just did another review of high end graphics accelerators For all around performance Windows, DOS, CAD go for ATI Graphics Ultra Pro They've done two reviews in the last three months and that card ranks as an editors choice in both reviews For all around performance it seems it just can't be beat You should pick up this issue of PC Mag April and check it out for yourself Windows The recent reviews have all shown that the P cards are significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card VGA The recent reviews have all shown that the P cards they looked at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card About the speed, as I recall The big question for me is the Orchid V card Each of the P cards tested so far has had the W to do VGA Orchid is the only one I know about I don't know about AMI that uses the W for VGA That is reportedly faster I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as the ATI card If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an Orchid V card has that card arrived What do the benchmarks look like Also, is the AMI P based card real What does it use for VGA Speed Bob
