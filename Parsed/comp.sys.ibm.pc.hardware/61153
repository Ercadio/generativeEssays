From Philip Sinn Subject ET W chip graphics accelerator I got a ET W card which is made by Cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it The card is a VL BUS card which can display million colours in x mode with MB DRAM It comes with ET W window drivers and a normal Et drivers The ET W drivers handles, x , x , x in colours Also, in x and x , it supports hicolor, K and K colours Here is my winmark result running on a MB DX EISA VL BUS system using Hint chipsets Winmark from ZD lab Using ET W drivers x megapixel sec k k x k k kx Using ET drivers x M x colours kx From the result, the ET W drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the Et W chip whereas the ET drivers are just normal driver for ET based graphics card The price of this graphics card that I got is from a local dealer It may be less from mail order It has OS drivers comes with it which supports colors on all resolution From these results, it has double the performance of a Et AX based card in colours mode Philip Sinn University of Washington It is all my opinions
