From Gerhard Wesp Subject DataSave Videostreamer A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't about a so called Videostreamer This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video recorder for backing up your data on a videotape The company DataSave claims that it can store up to GB on a minutes tape It costs DM about USD , I think My question is Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes REALLY fit on a minutes tape GB sounds quite unbelievable to me However, any comments on the interface are appreciated Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up if neccesary Thanks in advance Gerhard
