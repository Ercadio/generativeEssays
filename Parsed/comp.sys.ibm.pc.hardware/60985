From John Ngai Subject Questions on installing in I went out and bought the yesterday and installed it into my Gateway I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA and the default and then the PAS side with DMA and IRQ My question is how should I configure for MPU The manual and installation program recommended but on my machine it is configured to cascade to So can I still use or should I choose a different one Right now I have the MPU emulation mode turned Actually what is this cascade to business A related questions to other GW or VL bus machine owners I was told that only DMA are bit DMAs and are bit Now what about bit VL bus mastering DMAs Which DMA channel s is used by the VL bus extension to do bit DMA Yet another question after installing my Links golf game will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode Civilization however works fine at least so far Any body knows what I might have done wrong Thanks I am obviously a newbie John
