From John Ngai Subject Questions on installing PAS in GW K DX V I went out and bought the PAS yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway DX V I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA and IRQ the default and then the PAS side with DMA and IRQ My question is how should I configure for MPU compatibility The manual and installation program recommended IRQ , but on my machine it is configured to cascade to IRQ So can I still use IRQ , or should I choose a different one Right now I have the MPU emulation mode turned off Actually what is this cascade to IRQ business A related questions to other GW or VL bus machine owners I was told that only DMA , , are bit DMAs, and are bit DMAs Now what about bit VL bus mastering DMAs Which DMA channel s is used by the VL bus extension to do bit DMA Yet another question, after installing PAS , my Links golf game will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode Civilization however works fine at least so far Any body knows what I might have done wrong Thanks I am obviously a newbie John
