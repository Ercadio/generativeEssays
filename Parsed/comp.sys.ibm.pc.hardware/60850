From Ross Mitchell Subject ISA VLB xor EISA Advice Hi I need some advice opinions regarding which PC would best suit my needs I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things Editing documents using WordPerfect under dos Creating graphs analyzing data using Sigmaplot under dos Editing playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows these images can be large say x pixel Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView X and Sun PC NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation's this is where a lot of the images data come from and is the most demanding of these I've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system price performance would be cache ISA VLB ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro meg ram local bus monitor NI Etherlink III Maxtor IDE hard drive However the parts don't fit Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at surprise Actually after reading this group I'm surprised that they even have a local bus I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a with ISA and VLB or a with EISA and no VLB and thus the non local bus version of the ATI card Which is better keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks Any help would be greatly appreciated I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more BTW We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration cache ISA meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra meg ram monitor NI SMC Ethercard bit Maxtor IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card very fast ONCE the data gets to it Slow repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView X Its sluggish running the local window Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram There's not enough memory in the system DesqView X and a meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other Photostyler will page to disk with medium size I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer This machine sustains only sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain sec on the same Going to the bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to sec still very slow especially when moving large images Is there such a thing as a local bus ethernet card coming Will it make a difference I'm hoping so and leaning towards the choice above for that Also are there 's on the horizon What about 's 's Any information is greatly Ross Mitchell Imaging Research Lab John Robarts Research Institute Box Perth Drive office London Ontario Canada home
