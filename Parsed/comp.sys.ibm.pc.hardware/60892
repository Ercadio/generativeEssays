From Jim Graham Subject Re Courier vs Sportster NOTE followups to for obvious reasons In article Andy Nicola writes In a previous article Holly KS says What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier external and the Sportster external I see that the price of a Sportster has dramatically dropped to below but the price of the Courier remains above Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier the Courier is their top of the line product thus the higher I've never taken a real look at the Sportster line only Couriers but from what I've gathered it's basically more of an entry level probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the more recent Courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an again take all of the above with a grain of 've never evaluated the Sportster so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've if you want a real answer post the question in and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems I'd buy the Dual I'd get both HST and in fact this is exactly what I I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right and now to correct a few VERY incorrect folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and or UART questions post them to if you post in other groups you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good you may get something like the one below at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them to avoid spreading faulty info The Sportster at has error control and bis data just as it does at lower speeds there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation or that says that they can only operate on modems that are running of course is currently only STANDARDIZED for operation on top of in its primary mode of operation LAPM but that's about as far as that and just in case there's some confusion on this are also supported by the Courier line unless you have a really ancient one The difference with the Courier is that it can run at and only in the HST take a second look at the original question In a previous article Holly KS says What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier external see the up there the question was not about the Courier HST modem or about the Courier Dual was about the Courier the modem in question does not support HST it therefore does not support the kb also not all Courier HST Courier Dual Standard modems support the kb version of my Dual Standard only supports HST at there are even older models that only run HST at This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of the same type unit to achieve this HST is USR's proprietary modulation but we're not talking about HST we're talking about is most definitely NOT a proprietary modulation The Sportster will do asynchronous transmissions as well as The HST is one way I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some first off and are both synchronous and this is part of the CCITT Recommendation part of the standard it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual second HST is not one way '' more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both HST operates at in one direction and has a low speed back channel in the other the high speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data this is fine if you're logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files not using bimodem there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high speed channel needs to reverse and are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs are two completely different The HST's will be upgradeable to the spec when it is again more correctly put SOME of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever '' is called when it's if you have the large footprint Courier modems like I do you're there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new jim include std DE INTERNET ICBM AMATEUR RADIO Walton Beach FL AMTOR SELCAL NIAL E mail me for information about KAMterm host mode for Kantronics TNCs
