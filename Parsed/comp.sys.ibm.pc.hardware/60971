From jliukkon Juha Matti Liukkonen Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings Paul Bartholomew writes clip clip Would you care to explain to me then how my SoundBlaster Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ successfully I assure you that they are both set to IRQ and that I have no My computer is a DTK IBM Running MS DOS or a derivative OS Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified Technically the IRQ line is only a means for the device printer adapter SoundBlaster modem hard disk to signal the CPU that Something's happening here please take How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating In MS DOS the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the function that handles each Now basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not it simply ignores the When DOS prints it looks at the LPT If there's a character there wait a while and check If there's not copy a new character to the LPT Since the IRQ is ignored as a printer interrupt it's free for use for any other adapters in this case the With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS this kind of printing approach just doesn't work or more precisely it wastes a lot of CPU Hence you can't share the IRQ with and SB if you're running Unix or OS or Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses When the SB plays plain music the CPU simply tells it what to play until told With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is You can however hook two or more COM ports to one interrupt but use them only one at a This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came This of course applies for some other devices like LPT as Remember this was greatly simplified in parts but I think gives the general picture correctly Cheers Juha Liukkonen aka University of Helsinki of Lost Souls Trust me I know what I'm Sledge Hammer
