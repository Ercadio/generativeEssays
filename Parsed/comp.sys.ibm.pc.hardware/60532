From Wayne Rash Subject Re Monitors Mike Yang writes In article qslfs Wayne Rash writes I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F iW, which has just been released What's the difference between the F i and the new F iW I'm about to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F i upgrade Should I get the F iW instead Mike Yang Silicon Graphics, Inc The F iW is optimized for Windows It powers down when the screen blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it meets all of the Swedish standards It's also protected against EMI from adjacent monitors Personally, I think the F i is more bang for the buck right now
