From Subject Upgrading the processor on machines In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their or class machine without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts as I understand them If you have a PS Model or Model , you can replace the i chip with either a Cyrix DLC chip for which will increase your processing power by about for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie if you have a MHz machine the Cyrix DLC will run at MHz note Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows Or, you can get a Kingston NOW platform for with a MHz i SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about , if you were running at MHz originally But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions I think that it will continue to run at MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed There is also the Kingston NOW platform for with a MHz i DX on it This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure If you have a PS Model B or other PS machine with either an i SX or a non clock doubling i DX ie it runs at either or MHz in it, then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip which is really an i DX chip and replace your chip with it You should get about better preformance for both normal and math functions The Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs and the MHz version costs The replacement for the MHz SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the SX does not have Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run If you have a MHz SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at MHz, ie MHz externally and MHz internally There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week You might want to shop around as prices do vary If you need a name phone number for a source for a particular chip, e mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources Lawrence Khoo Lawrence Khoo Computer Consultant Econ Dept, Harvard U
