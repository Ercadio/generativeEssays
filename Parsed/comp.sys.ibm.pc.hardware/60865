From Subject Upgrading the processor on machines In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their or class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts as I understand them If you have a PS Model or Model you can replace the chip with either a Cyrix chip for which will increase your processing power by about for normal fuctions and not at all for math This chip will only run at your original clock speed if you have a machine the Cyrix will run at note Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Or you can get a Kingston NOW platform for with a on it which will increase your normal processing power by about if you were running at But again it will not increase the speed of your math I think that it will continue to run at even if your original processor runs at a slower There is also the Kingston NOW platform for with a on This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not If you have a PS Model or other PS machine with either an or a non clock doubling it runs at either or in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip which is really an chip and replace your chip with You should get about better preformance for both normal and math The Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs and the version costs The replacement for the chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the does not Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can If you have a then the Overdrive chip will run at externally and There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC You might want to shop around as prices do If you need a name phone number for a source for a particular chip e mail me and I will respond with a couple of Lawrence Khoo Lawrence Khoo Computer Consultant Dept Harvard
