From Mike Yang Subject Re Low Emission Monitors Who besides NEC In article C yp C K MITCH writes I am right now working on an MPR II certified Swedish standards for low emissions Hitachi Superscan monitor It's x , up to hz at that res, and it got a good write up for image quality in a recent Feb issue of PC Magazine As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality at least according to the mags I can't tell any difference between the two , but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types There's VLF Very Low Frequency and ELF I think that's Extremely Low Frequency The MPR II standards set strict limits on both But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which , which claim low emissions but not specifically MPR II Compliant or MPR II Certified only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other Nanao's F Series e g F i and T Series e g T i monitors are MPR II compliant According to my little pamphlet, the T Series monitors are also TCO compliant, whatever that is Mike Yang Silicon Graphics, Inc
