From Colin Paterson Subject Sound Blaster MIDI Hi I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs for the sound The first of which is a CMF voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon as soon as I can get it to an FTP site Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the FM synth The problem is that I have little or no info on the SB midi I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information but my German is poor to say the least if anyone has this book could they please mail My second request for help concerns standard file formats how can a file format be standard if you keep it secret I need to know the file format for instrument bank files and Roland music files Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA Please Help You know it makes Colin
