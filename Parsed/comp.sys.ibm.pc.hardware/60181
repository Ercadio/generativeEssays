From Donald Yee Subject w colors Orchid Pipe Dream Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with of It is an based I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say Buy the memory from us or something like The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given of All the buys you on the Fahrenheit is Just ONE more Had I known I wouldn't have I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid's software developers are busy with other So to get to the point finally ARE there any drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes I'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're If you want these modes steer away from Orchids cards VLB or VA VLB at least until their developers are less busy If the magazines are to believed I've only seen one product thus far which can handle color Genoa although evenn that might be a Please if there are generic or semi generic drivers out there let me know where I can get is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder
