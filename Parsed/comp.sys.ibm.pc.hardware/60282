From John Slagel Subject Re for joysticks is writes I'm using to read my joystick and it is hideously Something like of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick and this is in a program that does nothing but printf and JoyRead The problem is that a lot of programs trap like SMARTDRV and so it is a slow as hell Can I read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling And that isn't platform or clockspeed specific The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital How You send a command to the port to read it then you time how long it takes for the joystick port to set a certain This time is proportional to the joystick Obviously since time is used as a position you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste of If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS it would speed it up some but the time would still be John Slagel My old man used to tell me before he left this shitty world never chase buses or women you always get left The Marlboro Man
