From Daniel M Coleman Subject Re Diamond Stealth giving Winmarks In article westesC qvAp BGJ netcom com Will Estes writes I have just installed a Diamond Stealth ISA card in a ' DX system with K cache, and megs of memory, that gets about a SI CPU Benchmark rating Using the x x color driver under Windows, I am getting a Winbench Winmarks rating of only about Million Since I have heard that others get to million for this card, I assume that something is very wrong with my setup What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using On my local bus ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from million to million winmarks, depending on the version Winbench gives the most optimistic scores, gives the least A winmark rating is meaningless without a corresponding version number Dan Daniel Matthew Coleman Internet The University of Texas at Austin DECnet UTXVMS DCOLEMAN Electrical Computer Engineering BITNET DCOLEMAN UTXVMS BITNET
