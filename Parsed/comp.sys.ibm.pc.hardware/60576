From Mubashir Cheema Subject Can I have printers on a PC LAN I have recently plunged into PC I have been using Amigas Trying to establish a network LAN here that could use different Panasonic for printing receipts and Okidata for letters Is it at all possible in this world I know when using Unix etc I can specify which printer to print But I am not sure how PCs would handle If they can't then I guess I'll leave PeeeCeees for good and move on to Mubashir Cheema Sparco Communications Ph LaGalarie Fax Russell Street Suite email Starkville MS
