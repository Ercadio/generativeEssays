from michael bitz subject help is a samtron sc interlaced or non hello my colleague has a samtron monitor. on the manual cover, it says sc-431 and sc-428 for model numbers. the manual does not specify if it is interlaced or non-interlaced, so does anyone know what it is? thanks ------------------------------------------------------------
