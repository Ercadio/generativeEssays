From vg Volkmar Grote Subject IBM PS vs TEAC FD Hello I already tried our national news group without I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS PC with a normal TEAC I already identified the power supply on pins and shorted pin switch and inserted pullup resistors on pins and The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD but the FD's light stays on all the The drive spins up when I insert a disk but I can't access The TEAC works fine in a normal Are there any points I missed Thank Volkmar
