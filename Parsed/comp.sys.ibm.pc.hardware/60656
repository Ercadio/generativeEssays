From HJ Lu Subject Re Debugging possible hardware problems In article senator John F Carr writes I'm running Linux on an EISA system and I'm having what I think are hardware It could be software but I don't see why I'd be the only one having I'd like some advice on how best to debug The symptom when I try to build gcc I get unpredictable and unrepeatable Sometimes a file is not in valid Recompiling the file gives me a valid Sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core but works fine when run again with the same Compiling the same source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few object Note that Linux unlike many other systems does not put timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bit identical I also have occasional filesystem corruption on my SCSI drive but that could be caused by using development It could also be related to my problems The compile problems are not caused by disk problems I get the same results whether I do my work on an IDE or SCSI I've set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended Recommended for what DOS That is a I suspect the external cache but I have no real evidence for The motherboard is a NICE Super EISA with KB write back cache and a DX Mhz What I'm looking for A system test program to run under DOS or Linux Linux Fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the same time running Suggestions about the cause of the problem Bad memory bad motherboard bad Suggestions about how to debug the problem change wait state of turn off change bus speed swap
