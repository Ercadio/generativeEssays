From justin dolske Subject Re Wanted ISA mouse port with high interrupt Loran N Yourk writes With a sound card on interrupt , two serial ports one for modem on i , one for Miracle Piano on i and a printer port on i , I have run out of low interrupts What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of , , or which ever interrupt the PS mouse port uses in in ISA i computer I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, ATI checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port or even a serial port with high interrupts Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ to IRQ on AT class machines eg, anything with high IRQs This is what I'm doing on my set up right now I've got COM on IRQ really IRQ address it this way in software , COM on IRQ , SoundBlaster on IRQ , LPT on IRQ , and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between Works just great If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card and probably any others to work on the higher IRQs It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the bit expansion bus It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ This will be the first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response especially handy under multitaskers like OS which I'm running with no problems Justin
