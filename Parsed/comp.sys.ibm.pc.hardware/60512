From Wayne Smith Subject Re SCSI on dos In article Ib Hojme writes I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS I have a ST SCSI controller and two hard disks conected id's and I'd like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I don't have software to access it Does such a beast exist as shareware or PD Also what if I want a third disk I know that DOs only can see two two physical and four logical disks Will it be possible to use extra disks Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive once It was the Seagate N and the ST controller I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a interleave, so the best I could do with the drive was a interleave and a data transfer of about k sec I have had that drive controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives because the ST bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer's bios Dos will see many logical drives, much more than I've had up to I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST
