From Matthew Richard Arnold Subject DX vs DX Would someone be willing to explain to me the DX MHz is not more popular than it is I would think it would be just as fast, if not faster than the DX MHz for certian applications Plus, a MHz motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the chip in the future I must be missing something, since everyone is buying the DX Many adds don't even mention the DX Thanks a lot, Matt
