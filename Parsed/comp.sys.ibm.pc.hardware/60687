From Tim Biernat Subject Re No bit box on Gateway In article A Scott Linn writes While playing around with my Gateway local bus machine last night, it became apparent that Windows didn't give the option for bit access for virtual memory I am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local bus interface Is this expected, or should I be investigating further why no bit option appears you need to massage few switches in your system ini in the virtual memory section, flip the bitaccess switch on and the associated driver wdctl or some such switch on this will enable bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives and controllers support it for seriously fast disk access throw out WINDOZE install OS i did this weekend OS is incredible finally a REAL OS for the humble PC tim
