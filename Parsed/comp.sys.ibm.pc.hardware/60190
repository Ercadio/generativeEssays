From Subject int h for joysticks is slow I'm using int h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow Something like of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick, and this is in a program that does nothing but printf and JoyRead The problem is that a lot of programs trap int h like SMARTDRV and so it is a slow as hell interface Can I read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling And that isn't platform or clockspeed specific Thanks, Brianzex
