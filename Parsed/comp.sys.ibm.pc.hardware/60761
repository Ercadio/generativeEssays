From Gordon Lang Subject Re IP numbers on Ethernet Cards Tigger wrote Hi Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card Thanks in Advance Dave Tigger 'Tiggers are wonderful things ' Dave C Johnson I think you mean the ethernet The byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number ESN assigned to each ethernet board in This is a physical layer The IP address is a higher layer The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some unknown to you or I physical identification scheme number But to answer your question assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number it is not supposed to be possible to change the Of course the manufacturer can always retro fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do If your question is actually referring to the IP address it is most definetly But it is strictly Gordon Lang
