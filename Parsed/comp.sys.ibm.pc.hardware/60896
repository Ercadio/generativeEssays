From James Chuang Subject Re Any info on Cyrix chip It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix compatible and My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model The is a instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a socket Pin Grid Array or PGA The DLC currently is available in the the and the They do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as I guess they emulate the coproc Math functions are on the level without the actual The internal cache on the is Cyrix literature claims a hit My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a performance boost when it is enabled by Overall performance boost from a to a is about The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and The performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my with external CPU cache which is around the performance for a The computer runs noticebly faster and DOS with Dblspace is not The company claims OS compatibility but I didn't test The is not a chip as commonly The is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the which contains the logic to manage the clock This board plugs into the PGA and the or plugs into this I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is There are no info available from Cyrix Anyway the is available for and Double these clock rates and you get the and the If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the then they need to put out the I also tested a motherboard along with a Cyrix With external cache performance were about faster than the but still significantly slower than an actual Intel IMHO the DLC is a great low price upgrade for people who can't afford or can't install a new It is definitely worth what I paid for it but if you need performance the won't cut I'm not sure about the DLC but I think even if it matches the performance it won't beat it in any significant The last time I posted info about the DLC people sent quite a bit of mail asking where I got So here is where I got mine Treasure Chest peripherals they advertise in the Computer The kit was I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier and became a If you are interested in the chip e mail me and I can fax or mail you more I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use So I can t post anymore info However if there are more questions regarding the itself I'll post what I jamesc If someone asks if you are a God you YES
