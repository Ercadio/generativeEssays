From James Chuang Subject Re Any info on Cyrix DRu chip It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix compatible DLC and DRU My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model The DLC is a instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a DX socket Pin Grid Array, or PGA The DLC currently is available in speeds the , the , and the They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present I guess they emulate the coproc instructions Math functions are on the DX level without the actual coprocessor The internal cache on the DLC is K Cyrix literature claims a hit rate My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a performance boost when it is enabled by software Overall performance boost from a DX to a DLC is about The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones The performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my DX with K external CPU cache, which is around the performance for a SX The computer runs noticebly faster, and DOS with Dblspace is not complaining The company claims OS compatibility, but I didn't test it The DRU is not a chip, as commonly thought The DRU is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the DX, which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler This board plugs into the DX PGA, and the DLC or plugs into this board I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required There are no info available from Cyrix there Anyway, the DRU is available for DX , and DX only Double these clock rates, and you get the MHZ and the MHZ DLCs If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU , then they need to put out the MHz DLC first I also tested a DLC motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor With K external cache, performance were about faster than the , but still significantly slower than an actual Intel DX IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or can't install, a new motherboard It is definitely worth what I paid for it, but if you need DX performance, the DLC won't cut it I'm not sure about the DLC , but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't beat it in any significant way The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail, asking where I got it So here is where I got mine Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper The DLC kit was But I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer If you are interested in the chip, e mail me, and I can fax or mail you more info I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use, So I can t post anymore info here However, if there are more questions regarding the DLC itself, I'll post what I can jamesc If someone asks if you are a God, you say YES
