From DXB Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article qmgtrINNf a dns NMSU Edu , GRUBB says DXB writes In article qlbrlINN rk dns NMSU Edu , GRUBB says In PC Magazine April , Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI, faster than IDE, and support up to devices its acceptance has long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re performance Where do they get those numbers I'll list the actual performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd SCSI I ranges from MB s SCSI II ranges from MB s IDE ranges from MB s ESDI is always MB s although there are some non standard versions By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct How is twice Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes the statment correct Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless you understood that ESDI and IDE I include SCSI and ATA are completely different ESDI is device level, like MFM RLL With a SCSI controller chip SCSI can reach MB s which is indeed faster than IDE of is ALL these SCSI facts have been Great, you can compare two numbers ATA has several speed modes, by the way but what the article said was misleading wrong posted to this newsgroup in my Mac IBM info sheet available by FTP on sumex aim stanford edu in the info mac report as mac ibm compare version txt It should be but may still be there I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs if they are really interested in this stuff Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI chip an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI chip Not at a MB s, MB s burst it does not SCSI is MB s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER It seems that Mac and IBM see Something is missing there Anyway, I agree There's a lot of opportunity for marketing jingo like SCSI compliant which tells you nothing about the performance, whether it has WIDE support, etc One reference for the Quadra's SCSI controller chip is Digital Review, Oct , v n p What does it use Hopefully a good NCR chip e g c
