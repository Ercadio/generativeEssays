From david c Dave Subject Re how to search for bad memory writes steps deleted It's an interesting idea but the worst case data patterns developed to test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect common faults in memory I was having major memory problems a few monthes getting parity error system halted error message in I ran QA PLUS Check It Diagnose as well as several shareware memory I had a total of meg SIMM in my these store bought shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't place on a memory Out of exahperation I came up with the now deleted steps to find bad memory I found moral never buy memory stamped not for sensitive or critical applications on the anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using combinations of of the meg chips and creating a RAM drive to test Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems in I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for and the commercial shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with this line David China Cat BBS c cat mimsy anagld c cat david
