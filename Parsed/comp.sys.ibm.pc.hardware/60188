From Mohammad Al Ansari Subject CACHE or Micronics EISA VLB Motherboard This might be a silly question but I have to ask it I am in the process of purchasing an EISA VL Bus computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard that's the brand of the motherboard with OPTI chip set the other is Micron formerly Edge Technology and they use the Micronics EISA VLB I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support hr days wk and a better warrantee years Micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the I would REALLY appreciate any input on Is the Micron machine the clear choice Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard Thanks very much in advance for any Mohammad Al Ansari
