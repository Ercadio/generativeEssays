From Eric Bosco Subject Ram boards on a Hello I have a ISA machine with Pheonix Currently I have megabytes of RAM installed via eight MG SIMMS on the motherboard both banks are full and there is no space for more I am thinking of running on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows and I know that more RAM would be However with SIMMS the only solution I can see is to sell my Megs for about and by SIMMS for about Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather So my question is do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a ISA I have seen some being sold used for about with Mg with space for another ' If these boards do work how do they do it Is a device driver needed or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board I know that the ISA expansions slots are bits and SIMM memory is bits so probably all of this is just wishful However any help is truly Eric
