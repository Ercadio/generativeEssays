From Tim King Subject Gateway booting from floppy I have a Gateway with my inch floppy as drive I accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up rather than getting the Non system diskette message the machine hangs and the CMOS gets overwritten luckily Gateway sends a print of the standard CMOS settings with their systems This only happens with a box of pre formatted Fuji disks that I have no other disks cause this If I re format one of the Fuji disks the problem goes I did a virus scan scan of the disks and found Anyone have any idea what is going on here Hardware problem A virus that can't be detected The system reading in garbage from the boot sector Tim King
