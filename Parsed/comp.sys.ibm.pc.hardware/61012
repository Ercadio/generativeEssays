From George Newbury Subject Re How hot should the cpu be christopher kushmerick writes How hot should the CPU in a DX machine be Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than s I keep a big fan blowing on it, but am considering using a heat sink Any advice Don't hold your finger on it When cooking with it use a very small pan and be sure to not spill liquids on the components If you do not plan to cook with it there are a number of small cooling fans designed to mount on the chip and plug into your power supply Look in Consumer Shoppers Now if only some innovative person could design and produce a heat sink which could be used to keep my coffee warm, why I might even buy a Pentium
