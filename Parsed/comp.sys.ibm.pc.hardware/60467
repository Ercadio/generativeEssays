From Wayne Smith Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article A Richard Krehbiel writes Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than M RAM not working with their IDE drives M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the mb area the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers any of them, MFM, RLL, etc don't also use DMA
