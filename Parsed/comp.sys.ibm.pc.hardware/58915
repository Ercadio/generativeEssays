From Robert Desonia Subject Re I don't understand SI MG joohwee students wrote MG I went buying SIMMs recently and the sales person told me that the MG are chip SIMMs and chip SIMMs and one cannot use them interchan MG If you use one you have to use all of the same don't believe everything you are I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks' ok and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds mixing of and SIMMs in one bank The two only differ in the type of chips it Assuming that the SIMMS are bit wide here is the two equivalent The chip SIMM uses two bit wide of bit nibbles and one bit wide chip for a total of bit wide The bit SIMM uses nine bit wide These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM At the SIMM interface they both act as bit wide SIMMS sorry if too techie for ya MG Similarly one cannot plug in two SIMMs and one SIMMs to gi MG the system a total of Why is that so If my system supports MG of MEG it has SIMM slots can I plug in SIMMs to give my MG That sounds the problem is that if your computer takes bit wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one Why you ask Simple if you understand why there is Assuming you have a bit CPU or the data bus the mechanism to retrieve data from memory is bits wide so the computer expects to see bits when it asks for To get that bandwidth bit wide the motherboard links one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in this simple explaination to get bits That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only of the bit wide If you have a bit bus two SIMMs are linked together to get bit wide data which is the reason why banks are SIMMs wide and bit banks are SIMMs If your computer required bit wide data with parity bits used in some PS and ASTs you could upgrade by one SIMM at a Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not I could of just said 'because I said ' rdd WinQwk Unregistered Evaluation Copy KMail W NET HQ or HAL BBS QWK to Usenet gateway Four dial ins FREE Usenet mail and newsgroups PCBoard uuPCB Kmail Call or Member of EFF ASP ASAD disk Serving Ann Arbor since
