From Yearsley Subject Re CTX I started a similar thread about a month ago and got many The summary CTX Nasty low CTX Proscan Not as good as some other makes however Main problem seems poor quality Some reported pincushioning the problem I had others poor focus etc I complained about mine and it was 're tuned' I dodn't even pay shipping and returned to me in It's now clear well focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at I'm very happy with it and the digital controls and mode memory are Certainly a Trinitron say would be much nicer but that's well out of my price Conclusion If you're on a budget get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not It probably won't be when you get it but has good Chris
