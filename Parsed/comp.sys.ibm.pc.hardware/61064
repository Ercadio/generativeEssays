From Mika Iisakkila Subject Re SCSI vs IDE writes Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up No All that I've seen have also an on board BIOS which enables you to use up to hard drives directly under DOS drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter Software drivers often allow for better performance, though You have to use them if you want to use other devices besides hard disks or have more than disks Will this also be true of the bit OS's Obviously these are not able to use the bit real mode BIOSes that are written for DOS, so you need software drivers That's not a big deal as long as the drivers are available , because you won't have to fight with any low memory problems either Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software
