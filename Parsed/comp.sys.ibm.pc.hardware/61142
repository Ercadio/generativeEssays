From Guy Dawson Subject Re Cached Hardrives In article A BrockU CA , BrockU CA Tim Ciceran writes After reading many postings concerning hard drives I'm still unclear about one thing These new cached hard drives is the cache on the drive itself or is it separate, like on the controller or something Thanks to anyone who can clear this up I have two SCSI hard drives, each has KB of 'cache' There several reasons for this When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache May be the drive does some read adead caching as well TMC BrockU ca Guy Guy Dawson Hoskyns Group Plc Tel Hoskyns UK Tel IBM Austin USA
