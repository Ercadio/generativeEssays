From Scott Linn Subject No bit box on Gateway While playing around with my Gateway local bus machine last night it became apparent that Windows didn't give the option for bit access for virtual I am using a permanent swap file and the disk drive is on the local bus Is this expected or should I be investigating further why no bit option appears Thanks for any Scott Linn
