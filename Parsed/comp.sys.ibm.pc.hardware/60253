from scott linn subject no bit box on gateway while playing around with my gateway local bus machine last
night, it became apparent that windows 3.1 didn't give the option
for 32-bit access for virtual memory. i am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface. is this expected, or should i be investigating further why no 32-bit
option appears? thanks for any help. -- scott linn
