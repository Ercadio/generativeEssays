From Mike Lipsie MPU Subject Re Splitting drives into two does it make them faster In article D q B Andrew Rossmann writes Guy Dawson writes the partitions take up disk space, having or partition will cost somewhere between meg of hard disk space, if you can afoord this luxury more power to you, its your choice Where does all this disk space go The DOS partition table is fixed length and every hard disk carries one What is useing this lost MB If I remember right, the partition table is allocated an entire CYLINDER To find out how much it takes up, you need to calculate heads sectors Also, if you create an extended partition, there is a second 'partition' in there for the logical drives I think the original respondent Guy Dawson was refering to something much more elementary Every partition whether it is the entire disk or not has two FATs and an initial directory If you have a small disk meg or less , I would recommend that it remain a single partition Unless you have some other consideration If you have a large disk greater than meg , multiple partitions can make sense Mike Lipsie work Mitsubishi Electronic Research Laboratory home mikel dosbears UUCP
