From Guy Dawson Subject Re Why VESA Local Bus In article gregof Grego Filippo writes Hi fellow netters I have a question for I am gonna buy a MHz with VESA Local IS the speed benefit that great Would it be wise to spend on a local bus system HD controller and graphic card for normal use I mean I won't use it for a server Also I read an article from someone sorry I can't remember your name and he said that even though you have a local bus hard disk controller your performances won't be that much greater because of the disk's throughtput So what is the use of having a fast bus if the peripherals can't cope with it Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for V for Video the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video Since there are usually VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other How about an VLB ethernet card Move the data into the card at odd MB s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over Do do however free the local bus for other cards Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't Thank you Guy Guy Dawson Hoskyns Group Tel Hoskyns UK Tel IBM Austin USA
