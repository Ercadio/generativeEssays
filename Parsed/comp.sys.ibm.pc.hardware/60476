Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings From AR A J Rowatt They don't have a conflict because technically LPT does not use IRQ The Parallel printer processor the actual number escapes me contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ , then onto the main processor as Int x F By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int x F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused Windows may be a different story
