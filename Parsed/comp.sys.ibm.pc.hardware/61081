from lance hartmann subject re diamond products boycot in article markfried fellensiek writes diamond video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) >may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>come with them might make windows blindingly fast, but: most fellow diamond video board owners with whom i've corresponded may
or may not share your opinion about the proprietary clocking scheme, but
all of those with whom i've chatted have not been thrilled with the
window's drivers, either. some modes work fine, but others cause
strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc. many have also voiced their
strong discontent to diamond's ambivalent attitude toward os/2 drivers. come to think of it, though, i hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ati boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better. does anyone have an accelerated video board with drivers for windows
(os/2?) where all the modes function properly? anyone? anyone? lance hartmann (lance%) yes, that is a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
