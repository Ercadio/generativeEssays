From b Mike Sprague Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ , which is unreserved in contemporary computers using IRQ for the drives went out with the XT architechture Not completly true For AT class and later machines, IRQ is reserved for LPT Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer DX V It has a Modem on COM , a Mouse on COM , and the other serial port was set to COM which normally uses the same interrupt as COM We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ , and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM used IRQ As soon as we disabled COM , our problems went away Grumble after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work Mike
