>(os/2?) where all the modes function properly? anyone? anyone? to be honest, up until now, i have only found one bug in the diamond viper drivers, and it seems innocuous. that is, under microsoft word, select format border, click shading and take a look at the patterns. the 5% pattern has been swapped with the 90%, and so on. the whole list is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take it to another machine (i.e., a gup or ss24x machine) or print it and iy shows--badly! keep in mind that i use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so i can't speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty solid.
