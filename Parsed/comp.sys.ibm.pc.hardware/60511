From Shea Subject Re Recommendations for a Local BUS Cached IDE Controller In article Wayne Smith writes In article writes I have a Maxtor on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is I has the save transfer rate of MB s regardless of the variations of the ISA bus I tested it with speed between and Not any The problem is not the interface between the controller and the My advice Buy of RAM save and enjoy Computer mhz Bus ISA mhz Drive Maxtor mb I'd still like to here from people with VLB I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE I still want to know if some most IDE drives can handle bus speeds I recently bought a Micron VLB computer and the the local bus ide card was getting around s transfer rates says norton I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate I was told I would need norton in order to get a true account of my ide transfer I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that but I also don't know if I could tell the I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS bus speed at the like and noticed no significant change in Frank Shea Learn of the skillful Frank Shea He that teaches himself hath a fool for his master Rochester Institute of Technology Ben Franklin
