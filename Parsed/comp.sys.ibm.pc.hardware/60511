From F A Shea Subject Re Recommendations for a Local BUS Cached IDE Controller In article A Wayne Smith writes In article A writes I have a Maxtor MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is DX VLB I has the save transfer rate of MB s regardless of the variations of the ISA bus speed I tested it with speed between MHz and MHz Not any difference The problem is not the interface between the controller and the memory My advice Buy Megs of RAM, save and enjoy performance Computer mhz Bus ISA mhz Drive Maxtor A mb I'd still like to here from people with VLB IDE I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives I still want to know if some most IDE drives can handle bus speeds mhz I recently bought a Micron DX VLB computer and the the local bus ide card was getting around k s transfer rates says norton I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results I was told I would need norton in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't know if I could tell the difference I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS bus speed at the like and noticed no significant change in performance B fed Frank Shea Learn of the skillful Frank Shea He that teaches himself, hath a fool for his master Rochester Institute of Technology Ben Franklin
