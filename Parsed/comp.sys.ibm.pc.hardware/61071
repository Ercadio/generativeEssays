From Richard Arbanas Subject Using XT Pwr Spply I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new motherboard, hard drive, and MB floppy I am interested in using my old power supply W to power the new hardware, if possible I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only wires the th wire is a v line used to charge the motherboard battery My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire out of an wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source to charge the motherboard battery I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can make use of my existing one with simple hacks Thank you for any information An email reply to would be fine Larry Arbanas
