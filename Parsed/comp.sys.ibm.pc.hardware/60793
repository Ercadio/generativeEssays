From Bill Barnes Subject Re Q SCSI IDE i e or more hard drives In article A edu writes Has anyone successfully put both SCSI and IDE hard drives on the same system I would like to know as well, since I just bought a MB Seagate IDE drive and want to add it to my computer a four year old Gateway , which currently has an MB Seagate SCSI drive The SCSI controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS setup, i e both hard drive settings are listed as Not installed, and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders I wondering if this is a problem Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin install his second IDE drive, we had to define a master slave relationship for them do I need to do something similar here I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the boot drive Same here Any help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive ASAP I'd like to know what to do and what not to do before I start Thanks William Barnes SURAnet Operations voice fax Disclaimer I don't speak for SURAnet and they don't speak for me
