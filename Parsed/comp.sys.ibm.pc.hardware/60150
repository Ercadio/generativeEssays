From R v Kampen Subject Re Adding hard drive to Original IBM PC In article C DxB Michael Schuster writes In article lsj ruINN Keith Goolsbey writes I have an ORIGINAL IBM PC not an XT or AT that has never had a hard drive Questions Do I need new BIOS to add a hard drive Does anyone sell a complete package to do this Please e mail me with suggestions I only need to add about a Meg or Meg hard drive Sent by mail too You need the BIOS which has support for ROM BIOS extensions, such as the ROM on a hard disk controller A MB hard card, available for not much over , will do the trick if you have the proper BIOS date Use Norton SI or similar program to find out you also need to set the correct switch settings on your xt controller, which can be a pain, since most pc's don't come with proper docs for all hardware contained inside it
