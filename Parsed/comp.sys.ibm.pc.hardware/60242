From JRW Subject Re Shopping for a new NEC monitor In article qjfa INN David M Todd writes From David M Todd Subject Re Shopping for a new NEC monitor Date Apr In article qhppp Bill Barnes writes Basically I'm looking for a SVGA x non interlaced monitor The NEC FG is the one most of the computer mags use as their standard, and from what I've seen and heard it looks pretty good, but it's a bit expensive bucks is the best deal I've seen So I thought perhaps I might find something as good for less Any recommendations I also thought about the NEC FGx, which has the same specs as the FG except for the scan frequency, which is more limited anybody have any comments on this one Would it work with I believe that NEC is replacing the FG and FGx with FGe and FGe models, reportedly being released at the end of this month I'm waiting for a FGe, the main difference being a year warranty and higher refresh rates at the higher resolutions It sounded from a PC Magazine note that the FGe was being boosted in a number of ways Call the NEC number and have them send you info David M Todd Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA USA Phone David Todd Psych UMass EDU Fax I have been using a NEC FGx for several months now Several others here also have this monitor We have had no problems Personally I would spend extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as MHz viz Mhz Based on the comments of others you might want to view the FGX vs the series on a PC running windows at x The refresh rate appears ok for me, but you might feel differently Finally speaking of spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is certainly worth Recently I set up a friend's PC Mhz and VESA local bus The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost
