From Richard Krehbiel Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article qsa INNm b dns NMSU Edu GRUBB writes Richard Krehbiel writes Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated MHz clock, bit width, MB sec If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the MB s sighted for IDE come from Well, some quick math on my part shows that an MHz bus, bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide M bytes sec Someone said that it really takes clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to MB s, which is the commonly used figure for ISA bus speed However, I believe a two clock transfer is possible wait states Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes along
