From Wayne Summer Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article Wayne Smith writes I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multi tasking OS's when managing data from a single SCSI hard I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus vs MHZ The Amiga has had a pre emptative multi tasking OS since ' and can operate with MB RAM SCSI is used almost exclusively on these A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple This is espically true with SCSI tape For example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the This greatly increases productivity or at least do something else while backing up your hard drive Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this Its a long story but I still use IDE on my except for the CDROM which thanks to SCSI I can move between both If and when SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines I plan to completely get rid of Wayne Summer AMIGA Simply the Palm Bay US X Quote of the week Don't hate microsoft because because they are microsoft them because their products are lame Found in
