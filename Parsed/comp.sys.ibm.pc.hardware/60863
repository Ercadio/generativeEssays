From Jeff Lab QueensU CA Wes Garland Subject CD ROM drive help Hello All I recently acquired a CD ROM drive, a Mitsumi mfg Feb Hey, it was free I'm quite pleased with the performance, but it seems to crash a lot when I use PLAYCD EXE that came with it a DESQview Thoughts This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and I load the program up If I load the program, it doesn't crash, and I start the disk, stop the program and start the BBS its OK, but otherwise I have big problems IE, they can only be solved with a cold boot If anybody can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because I'm sure somebody else would like to know Cheers, Wes Wes Garland, at Queen's University Terminal Velocity Kingston Kingston, Ontario, CANADA Fidonet Usenet Access free Jeff Lab QueensU CA school v bis bps Wes G home Send Email to set up full access account
