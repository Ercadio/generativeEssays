From Micah Lax Subject HELP BIOS upgrade on Compaq Deskpro Howdy I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro with a Phoenix replacement BIOS in order to support an IDE hard drive and a high density I assumed that this would be a plug and play procedure but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen Everything is hunky dory except the floppy which will read but NOT WRITE Any write attempt merely corrupts both I have tried everything I can think Any takers Micah Lax on INTERNET
