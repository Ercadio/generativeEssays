From ab Freenet carleton ca Micah Lax Subject HELP BIOS upgrade on Compaq Deskpro Howdy, I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive, and a high density floppy I assumed that this would be a plug and play procedure, but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it Everything is hunky dory except the floppy, which will read, but NOT WRITE diskettes Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs I have tried everything I can think of Any takers Micah H Lax on INTERNET
