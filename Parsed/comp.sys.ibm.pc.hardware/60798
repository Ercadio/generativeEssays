From michael jester GUN de Michael Gerhards Subject Re Modems and UARTs RYAN JEFFREY BAUCOM wrote What is a UART I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally, the older boards have a or UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received The UART has an internal byte buffer, so with the right software installed it generates an IRQ every chars What does it do for high speed modems Is it necessary for k or higher throughput If you ran dos, you don't need a , because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS , Unix, etc windows , the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts Is it only for internal modems NO The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board If you have any experience with or higher speed modems, please let me know what you think Also, any particular brand name reccomended, or will a cheapo clone do just a well I use a Zyxel B with a UART under COHERENT I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem Michael Michael Gerhards Preussenstrasse Germany Neuss Voice
