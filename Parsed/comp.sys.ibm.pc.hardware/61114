From john a siegel Subject Can't set COM G Ks answer Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people who responded to the original request for help The ATI VLB video board uses the addresses for COM They could suggest no work around I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM even though it could not possibly work for credit against a bus mouse This will free up the COM port I need too bad the original salesman who suggested either the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know enough about the hardware Otherwise I must say that the DX system has worked very well no problems with any other hardware or software John Siegel
