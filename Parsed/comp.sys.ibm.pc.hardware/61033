From UC handy Subject Help needed on installing nd IDE HD greetings I'm a novice in messing comp hardware My original IDE HD is a MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it And I just got a MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive I did change the jumper settings on A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my M Western Dig, since I didn't have any doc on it And as I predicted, It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller So, I had to take my M off install my A to be my only HD any help on this matter would be much appreciated before I trashed my MB Thankx much Handy Trisakti
