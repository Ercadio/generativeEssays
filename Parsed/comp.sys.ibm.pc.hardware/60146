From GRUBB Subject Re Why VESA Local Bus Guy Dawson writes How about an VLB ethernet card Move the data into the card at odd MB s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over How about s for bit VLB or s for QuickRing Apple's implimentation of VLB Byte QuickRing is interesting in that it allows interleaving with other card so that the s can be divided among many cards at the same time NuBus and MCA are about the only card interfaces able to DO anything with that kind of speed and even NuBus ditzes around at s with a burst mode MCA Also called Micro Channel IBM's and bit bus allows use of more than one CPU in a computer DCT and anything can talk to anything as fast as the two components involved can handle Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA and Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC Carl Jabido IDA can't handle VLB speed never mind QuickRings's speed so it is EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds s burst mode s so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by PCI is a competing interface that is still in
