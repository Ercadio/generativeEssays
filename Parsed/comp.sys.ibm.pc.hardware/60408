From Daniel J Thumim Subject Re or grayscale displays A quick look through the Computer Shopper gave the following companies that sell monochrome monitors for less than PC or PS compatible Cornerstone Technology, Digital Technology, Hardware That Fits, IBM, Ikegami, Image Systems, Nanao, Radius, Ran Ger Technologies, Sampo, Samsung, Sigma Designs Most of these are single scan monitors, which are useless for most PC users I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which were mostly fruitless, but I have managed to track down two multisync grayscal monitors in the range, one and one I am still looking into it, and I will post the results when I get more info I am looking into a group purchase as well aniel Thumim
