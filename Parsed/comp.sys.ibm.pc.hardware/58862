From Keith Rice Subject Re Drive Controller Compatibility Thanks to all who responded to my original I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super It will handle hard drives with up to read write heads and up to The upgrade is payable by check or money Send to Western Digital Corporation Technical Support Group Box Irvine CA The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the The BIOS on my system would only handle up to The responses to my request for help follow my Warning It's Keith Keith Rice University of North

ponder you write I recently bought a used Seagate ST hard The guy told me that it had been fully tested and that it was I took it home to install in my Compaq Portable OK I'm a little behind in technology I already had an MFM I installed the drive and powered up the I got a post error My controller is a Western Digital As I said above the drive is a Seagate ST The system is a Compaq Portable circa Ah finally a question I can I mess with this older stuff Kinda First problem I can forsee is that the ST will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios Check the numbers on It should be the only non smt chip on the Slightly below center and The bios should read either or If the last digits are you got Controller jumpers are set as follows represents jumper Looks and are factory jumped with a trace between pins and to select the primary controller The drive jumpers are as follows represents jumper Looks art deleted Here are my questions Are the drive and controller compatible w each other I notice you left out the jumper table Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it If you have the rom set it like this open open open open closed closed open open Note those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper Top to 's represent the jumper Pins and select the first drive setting drive and pins and select the second drive drive If you have the rom it's a auto config and I'll have to look up how to do I don't have the big book right Are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly See You might have problems if the jumpers are not Also at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and On the jumper on the try moving it to the opposite side of the It's one or the The narrow data cable goes to I've thrown it on a few times and banged my head for a Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade IBM roms had to be later than A quick way to check is to boot dos and run Enter d fffc the is the debug prompt This will return the rom date if it's of any Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above I It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking Bob Valentine From Mon Apr Received from by ponder id Mon
