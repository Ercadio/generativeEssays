From D Keith Rice Subject Re Drive Controller Compatibility Thanks to all who responded to my original post I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS It will handle hard drives with up to read write heads and up to cylinders The upgrade is , payable by check or money order Send to Western Digital Corporation Technical Support Group P O Box Irvine, CA The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the WD series The BIOS on my system would only handle up to mb drives The responses to my request for help follow

I recently bought a used Seagate ST hard drive The guy told me that it had been fully tested and that it was good I took it home to install in my Compaq Portable OK, I'm a little behind in technology I already had an MFM controller I installed the drive and powered up the system I got a post error, My controller is a Western Digital WD S WX Rev C As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST The system is a Compaq Portable circa Ah, finally a question I can answer I mess with this older stuff alot Kinda fun First problem I can forsee is that the ST will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom Check the numbers on it It should be the only non smt chip on the board Slightly below center, and left The bios should read either or x If the last digits are , you got problems Controller jumpers are set as follows represents jumper W W W W W W W Looks right W and W are factory jumped with a trace between pins and to select the primary controller address The drive jumpers are as follows represents jumper Looks right art deleted Here are my questions Are the drive and controller compatible w each other I notice you left out the S jumper table settings Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has If you have the rom, set it like this open open open open closed closed open open Note those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block Top to bottom 's represent the jumper pins Pins , , and select the first drive setting drive and pins , and select the second drive drive If you have the rom, it's a auto config, and I'll have to look up how to do it I don't have the big book right here Are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly See above You might have problems if the S jumpers are not right Also, at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good On the jumper on the , try moving it to the opposite side of the drive It's one or the other The narrow data cable goes to J I've thrown it on J a few times and banged my head for a day Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade Dunno IBM roms had to be later than A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug Enter d f fff fffc the is the debug prompt This will return the rom date, if it's of any use Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to Bob Valentine

drive When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not boot To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W or add a jumper at position R depending on which model of XT controller you are using NOTE TANDY SYSTEMS The WD A WX , WD A WX , WDXT GEN and the WD X can be modified to operate in Tandy series computers, models SX, TX and the original or A version These computers utilize an interrupt of IRQ instead of IRQ , the IBM standard To modify the WD A WX or the WD X to operate in these systems, you must cut the etch between pin and pin at jumper position W Then solder pin and pin at the position W To complete the modification, a jumper must be added to position of switch S rows of pins PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD To modify the WD A WX , WDXT GEN or
