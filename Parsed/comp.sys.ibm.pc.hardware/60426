From Richard Krehbiel Subject Re IDE vs SCSI In article The Great Randalli writes Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS I might need an SCSI controler rather than an Will performance suffer that much For a or so drive If I don't have a tape drive or CD ROM Any help would be Richard Randall There is a way in which a multi tasking computer actually gives you more CPU power then you had before and that is with I O With I O overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish and disk operations take an eternity compared to a fast So when you've got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you One way is with DMA or bus Either of these make it possible for I O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the The alternative is for the CPU to move the There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes with no Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes
