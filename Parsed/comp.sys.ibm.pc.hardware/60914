From mw rrz Uni Koeln DE Markus Wischerath Subject Re Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings In article , Paul Bartholomew writes When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's because they're implemented by a single card Interesting Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ successfully I assure you that they are both set to IRQ and that I have no problem My computer is a DTK IBM clone Paul Bartholomew You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them simultaneously , under Dos at least Both LPT and SB just sit there until you tell them to do something You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per second Markus
