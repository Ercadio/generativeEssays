From ab cleveland Freenet Edu Sam Latonia Subject Re Monitors I have a Sony S monitor and I don't see any lines across the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode But because of the hor lines and poping that I do see and hear when I am usinf x x and x x modes and switch back to anything of less I would not buy another Sony at what ever price Oh ya this is I guess a viewing area It don't impress me one bit Sam Gosh I think I just installed a virus It was called MS DOS Don't copy that floppy BURN IT I just love Windows CRASH
