From Nic Percival x Subject Non turbo speed Just taken delivery of a MHz DX machine, and very nice it is too One query the landmark speed when turbo is on is or something MHz thats not the problem The problem is the speed when turbo is off Its MHz The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button that turns it into a skateboard Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of turbo vs non turbo I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about or MHz with turbo off Cheers, Nic Percival Well that was a piece of cake, eh K Micro Focus, Newbury Piece of cake master Radial slice of baked Ext confection coefficient of relevance to Key to Time zero Dr Who
