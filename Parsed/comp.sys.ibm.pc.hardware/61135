From Guy Dawson Subject Re SCSI or IDE The Bottom Line In article Randy Ellingson writes Which would YOU choose and why I have both I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it has a SCSI hard disk CD ROM and I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices For the price of one irq and dma I have three different types of device connected Faster drives are also available for SCSI I have a DEC that realy does have a average seek it finds data faster than my Toshiba Like lots of people I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard Right now I have a IDE drive Seagate and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus I'm currently thinking about adding another HD in the to And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit I believe I'm getting something like sec transfer right now according to NU s is pretty How would this number compare if I bought the state of the art SCSI card for my ISA PC and the state of the art SCSI hard drive the best system I could hope for Many state of the art SCSI disks use the SAME mechanicals as many state of the art IDE Only the interface electronis differ look at the Fijitsu drive for an example Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost I use an Adaptec on my Unix box and no name IDE cards on Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top of the line IDE caching controller for my HD And how much would it cost Caching controller Why What does it give you that smartdrive for DOS does not About extra lower memory That's about A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching controller My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at s That's faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain Thanks for any Randy Guy Guy Dawson Hoskyns Group Tel Hoskyns UK Tel IBM Austin USA
