from mike white subject i've lost com help i have a clone, and an internal modem set to com4.
it worked fine until i upgraded to dos 6.0 and at the
same time reloaded windows 3.1 now the system can't
find com4; msd says com4 is "n/a", and three of my
four comm programs say "hardware not present" or some
similar error message. procomm, however, finds the modem
no problem and works fine! curiouser and curiouser. any
hints/help? thanks. mike ******************************
