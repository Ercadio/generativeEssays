From Mike White Subject I've lost COM Help I have a clone, and an internal modem set to COM It worked fine until I upgraded to DOS and at the same time reloaded Windows Now the system can't find COM MSD says COM is N A , and three of my four comm programs say hardware not present or some similar error message Procomm, however, finds the modem no problem and works fine Curiouser and curiouser Any hints help Thanks Mike These are my opinions only
