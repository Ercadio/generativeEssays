From Roger C Pao Subject Re Booting from B drive Gordon Lang writes David Weisberger wrote I have a drive as drive A How can I make the system boot from my B drive Optimally, the computer would be able to boot from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk But if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that it can't boot disks, that's OK Also, boot b won't do the trick for me Thanks, Davebo We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway I finally got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives The only reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several bootable 's and some based install disks which expected the A drive I order all new software and upgrades to be and the number of stupid install programs that can't handle an alternate drive are declining with time the ones I had are now upgraded And as for the bootable 's I just cut replacements If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up a drive switch to your computer chasis I haven't tried it but I think it would work as long as it is wired carefully I did this I use a relay Radio Shack PDT instead of a huge switch This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the drive switch will work correctly for some programs rp Roger C Pao gordius,bagdad mts rpao,
