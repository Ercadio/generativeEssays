From bs tekig PEN TEK COM Robert L Swarts Subject Re DOS In article Apr ucsu Colorado EDU koberg spot Colorado EDU Allen Koberg writes In article AA Danny Halamish writes Also, DBLSPACE is crap It writes about slower than stacker, reads about slower, and compresses about LESS All tests were made on the same computer with the same disk, no cache, and the same big files were used Couldn't agree more On my I don't miss the speed It's still faster than a normal disk read would be As for the less compression, koberg I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access Does anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker and Dblspace bs
