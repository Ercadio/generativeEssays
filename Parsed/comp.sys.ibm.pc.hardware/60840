From Chris Crayton Subject Date is stuck On John Bongiovanni had the unmitigated gall to say this Suddenly the date no longer rolls The time is reasonably accurate allways but we have to change the date by hand every This involves exiting the menu system to get to JB Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance something like JB a clock has to make a Get Date system call Apparently the clock JB hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this date advance JB The Get Date call notices that a midnight reset flag JB has been set and then then advances the When a program uses a DOS call to get the system it resets the flag that tells the BIOS that it has passed It then uses this flag to increment the If the menu does a call to the system to get the time before midnight before the BIOS sees the midnight flag then BIOS will not know that the day passed and the date will not get I might have some DOS's and BIOS's mixed up darned cold messed up my brains but this has been a well documented problem for I don't know of a Hope this helps Two most common elements in the universe Hydrogen Blue Wave QWK The Ozone Hole BBS A Private Bulletin Board Service Full Service Nodes USRobotics bps Gigs Files SKYDIVE New Orleans RIME Network Mail HUB Usenet Newsgroups Please route all questions or inquiries to
