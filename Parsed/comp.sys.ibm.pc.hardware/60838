From Gordon Lang Subject Re HOW is a Null Modem Cable Kevin Kimmell Computer Science German Undergrad wrote I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem Actually I have NO idea so don't count that last What I'm asking is what pins does it use or what are it's specifications I just want to solder one myself instead of buying I don't even know what port is Help me please at Kevin I'm intending to use the cable for PC to PC transfers via Lap Link or Ideas and info gladly I do not have specific knowledge of Lap Link or Telix but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null modem The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS and null modems but you should still check your software I will eplain a couple of details of RS RS is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a Actually it can be between any end system and any communications The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment DTE and DATA Communications Equipment DCE RS spells out the voltage levels the connector type the pinouts and the signal The connector is a DB but IBM has set an alternative standard of DB The primary signals are Transmit Data TD Recieve Data RD and Signal Ground SG There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the For example the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready DTR DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the Similarly the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready DSR DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the Ok that's five signals there are only four more of The Request To Send RTS signal is an output from the DTE and an input to the DCE that is used to ask the DCE permission to send If the DCE agrees it sends an ok via the Clear To Send CTS For completeness the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE The other two signals of interest are Ring Indicator RI and Data Carrier Detect DCD These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the RI is just what you would expect a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the This is rather specific to the modem telephone line DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the connection has been established the local DCE is talking to some remote There that's Oh there are many other RS signals defined but they are I have explained the nine signals that are on a The pinouts are as follows Name DB DB SG TD RD DTR DSR DCD RTS CTS RI Now to address your problem at When you connect a PC to a PC a DTE to a DTE there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS signal definitions don't work out quite There is no DCE to assert the CTS DSR DCD or So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as If this is done you simply make a null modem a cable that passes through SG and crosses TD and RD pin of one end connects to pin at the other end etc The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is It would have to just send the data and hope it got Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR DSR pair A particular point a confusion is in the software Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft ware will use If you are using the built in BIOS to control the serial port then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be But if you have a package such as Brooklyn Bridge or Lap Link or Telix then those packages dictate the cabling The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG TD and The DTR DSR is also fairly There is one more issue that needs to be addressed And that is flow In the RS scenerio the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over run the By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted the DCE will send data without requesting permission Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio the question is do you need flow control The answser is But how For non binary communications one common technique is XON XOFF which is implemented in software no wires are dedicated to flow control the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol A work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes but the hardware flow control is prefered The problem with hard ware flow control is that there is no There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS CTS for one But beyond that anything is fair Again you must look to you comm package for cabling But I bet you'll find that one cable if wired properly could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same By the way I am familiar with one package that uses RTS CTS and DTR DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to This does not mean a differnt cable it is just The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support ing it in For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end or perhaps the DTR to the CTS Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires Specifically I am talking about the Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole One more gotcha signal is the Some software including the PC BIOS expects to see the DCD before it will This signal sometimes gets shorted with the But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to And of course the DTR DSR are crossed as are the TD RD and of course the SG must pass This null modem works with most The flow control if any can use the RTS DCD with the DTR If your package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection then I suggest you use this TD RD RD TD DTR DSR DSR DTR DCD RTS RTS DCD CTS CTS Gordon Lang
