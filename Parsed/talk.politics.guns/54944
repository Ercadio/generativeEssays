From Jason Kratz U Subject Statement to everyone on Ok here Yes folks I realize I have stuck my foot in my mouth quite a few times already so please let me make some My inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of Thanks to you kind and some not so kind people I am Some people have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti gun I have said several times before but nobody seemed to be listening that I am pro gun and anti gun As far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one thing to say I am in no way Some of the things I have stated were said to demonstrate that I am not prejudiced and or a racist but I have been accused of being too aware of race and I will not say anymore about that subject because no matter what I say it will be the wrong Boy what a start to being on a new Oh well things have been worse in my I hope this clears things up but I guess that will remain to be By for now Jason
