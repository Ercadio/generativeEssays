From Tavares Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article CMM Thomas Parsli writes If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and or records of SERIOUS mental Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun club for months BEFORE I could collect my So like what do you do during those six months to be active My town has a similar requirement and it's rather Before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun Well how active can you be without a gun chief Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing IF it couldn't be abused by the But every time this is proposed there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a And we oppose It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US is around times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners I'd think twice before using this Besides the problem is criminal use of guns not There are about criminal uses of guns in the US every year but only I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets Just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses IF they couldn't be abused by the But they already have One state doesn't hold the courses another doesn't fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political Is this fair Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets How many are borrowed stolen smuggled bought on the black market Use of knives It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or 'open' You Americans think it's ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth Some states allow ONLY open Some allow ONLY concealed Some allow Some allow both but require licenses for concealed All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences a bad way to Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive' We northeners are not as hot livered as southeners but when we decide to take action we Hot I LOVE that Here we say hot Individual vs masses Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others Typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime Of course it is a crime for a felon or ex felon to possess a gun but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre felons waiting to commit We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as I don't understand this IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in But should it have to be like that Life isn't I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either or flood and theft insurance or to lock the doors of my house and But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy some states None of ours I'm If you believe it's smart neccacery to have drivers licence WHY do you think it should be free to buy guns Frankly I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone The people who drive safely never use it and the people who drive drunk drive without it However a car is a good tool but not one that protects my right to I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel I'm not a pacifist or anti I would defend my home loved ones and country but I don't view guns as neccities or I HAVE done army service and HAVE used a variaty of weapons but wouldn't want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good' The question is not whether or not you want to own guns It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one If you believe that I speak for my company OR write today for my special Investors'
