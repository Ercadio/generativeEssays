From Jason Kratz U Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article Vincent Fox says stuff all mine Define armed better Go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the Colt Does one fires faster than the other Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just YOU trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose This is why the military is limiting it's M now to Aw come It worked great in the 's or the movie version of the ' anyways round burst Simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful A revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same stuff deleted about how revolvers are just as good as semi autos All your points are very well taken and things that I haven't considered as I am not really familiar enough with Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old Too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they Not that Glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched The only thing that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on Sure there is that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay I do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a Actually I don't watch those shows And you're right at least partially I don't know much about I'm more familiar with Gun control is hitting what you aim If you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a I own a Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime Why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often Well actually some police prefer the much heftier Magnum but ObPlea Don't flame me I prefer semi autos for most But they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone If everything had gone as planned everything would have been BATF spokesperson on CNN regarding failed raid attempt in No flames All your points are well Guess I still have a lot to learn but thanks to this discussion I already am Guess I assume too many things like more bullets are better and that sort of Of course you know what happens when you assume Jason
