From Charles Scripter Subject Re Some more about gun In article John Lawrence Rutledge wrote In article Aaron Ray Clements writes The Second Amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear Clearly and unequivocally without Unfortunately the Second Amendment is not as clear as you If last part of it is taken along it follows what you have The problem I have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the The Second Amendment is A well regulated militia being necessary to the security Militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear State arms shall not be Arms You didn't even get the capitalization correct Try reading USCA on the Constitution or get any other CORRECT version of the This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses According to the Federalist Paper's a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers James Madison Federalist Paper Besides the advantage of being armed which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with James Madison I Annals of Congress June The right of the people to keep and arms shall not be A well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free Alexander Hamilton Federalist Paper on the organization of the militia Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a Alexander Hamilton Federalist Paper speaking of standing armies if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow But surely Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they said people right That's why the Amendment refers to the Right of the Militia Your average year old male does not fall into the You're right the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males and probably females under current interpretation Therefore most members of The Militia the one the every gun advocate refers to are not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly The Amendment does nor refer to well organized it says well regulated I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how well regulated I mentioned in the If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep and bear arms why did it specificly mention a well organized militia in the SAME SENTENCE as the right to keep and bear arms That's why the Right is reserved to the And that was to insure the People could form a well regulated Militia not a well organized militia It could be argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last If so why was it include in the same atomic unit of written What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument Any moron can set h bar C instead of a separate sentence Oh I see what your question is Why don't you read the federalist Papers James Madison Federalist Paper regarding the General Welfare clause Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the He only wrote The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with the security of a free The Federalist Paper's mention of a well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects the security of a free All these examples are actions of a very organized force not some John Public with a That's obviously because you've never actually read the Federalist All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the people's right to form well regulated militias shall not be That is people have the right to join a well organized This well organized militia will of course provide training in how to use arms and in basic military These training members of the militia can keep and bear the Can't read huh Show me where the document says well organized militia Lastly reading through the Federalist Paper's on well organized militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these One reason stated is the protection from a standing These days the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every year old male and female not in the armied That is exactly why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own any weapon currently in use in the armed Another reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need for a standing Well the US Armied Forces have been a standing army for more than half the history of the But the major reason is to protect against that very same It seems to me the whole reason for the Second Amendment to give the people protection from the US government by guaranteeing that the people can over through the government if necessary is a little bit of an anachronism is this day and Maybe its time to re think how this should be done and amend the constitution Abraham Lincoln

Sir is the use of a militia It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always attempt to destroy
