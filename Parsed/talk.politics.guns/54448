From John Scott Subject Luser Awesley wrote That was the entire point to you What exactly did I claim I've heard eye witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper Quite I wasn't wrong I've heard those If you're paying attention I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes but the main gun firing was an account I That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the to use your words bullshit filters Stating that I claimed this is a Later in the same post Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt some were in Based on what I remember I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or Fine now you are stating that you believe their claims or that you are inclined See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs Those claims are still ludicrous Previously Awesley had written You can also read of the troops using grenade Prompting me to write To fire fragmentary grenades I doubt that as To fire concussion grenades To fire tear gas But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags wouldn't you since it makes your other claim seem more To which Awesley replied John again strawman Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down What I read said nothing about what they And so I put nothing in If you need some help let me know and I'l take your side of this for a You're not scoring here you're boring But why did you mention grenade launchers at all Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary But that too is I wrote If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half I would know about Awesley relied Glad to know you're such an Nice to hear some an I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge if it had happened you would have know Since you are such an authority you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover up in the number of people killed in the Detroit Some claimed dead others said The offical number is but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was several I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat You'd assert that I claimed they were Yes if it happened I would have heard about Everybody would Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 's without it becoming common knowledge without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again without civil libertarians saying this has gone far So yes my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the Now I have more reasons to disbelieve Not one poster has written to say yes I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired This is the If it had happened somebody here would remember Furthermore your own research failed to come up with any support for the The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence extraordinary or Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the I do I wrote Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it Awesley wrote Taking the tour after the riots it was pretty easy to tell the difference between Army and Guard Or so I recall from years And I seem to recall it was the Army running the So it would have been an Army cover Fine it was an Army cover Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt ridden participant has come forward and said yes I shelled Americans or I gave the orders to fire the cannons or I helped cover it up I wrote If your mind is open enough to believe that well good for I prefer to live in And here in reality I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells much less fired Awesley replied Given the level in destruction in Detroit I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they Your belief fails a basic reality check why isn't it known Awesley concludes Now then we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the account I Actually now we have established that I don't believe what you believe as well as why I don't believe And if it's boring then I yield the last word to you if you want You may say anything you like with impunity I am dropping the John Scott
