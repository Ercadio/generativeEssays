from larry cipriani subject the dayton gun buy back re boston gun buy back according to wnci fm radio this morning, dayton, ohio is operating a
gun "buy back". they are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in.
they ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of
some sort. they are looking for more funds to keep operating. another
media-event brought to you by hci. is there something similar pro-gun people can do ? for example, pay $100
to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ? sounds a bit
tacky, but hey, whatever works.
