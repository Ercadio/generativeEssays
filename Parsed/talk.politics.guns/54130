From Geoff Miller Subject Re The 'pill' for Deer No Hunting writes Promising field experiments are being done this year in several areas of the country relating to chemical contraceptive baits for Preliminary data suggests that this will be a cost effective and humane method for preventing over population of Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost effectiveness of this It may be cost effective for deer if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is negative a profit because the majority of hunters pay for The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals which is not in fact the You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor General's residence has now reached plague Despite the whines of the rampant animal libbers the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled So now why should we allow hunting to prevent over population of the deer bear whatever Sorry but that 'justification' of blood lust is now gone with the Once mass production of this stuff begins animal populations can be easily managed without a shot being This leaves only the fact that some people like to go out in the woods and kill Some people take satisfaction IMHO legitimate satisfaction in eating food that they have harvested The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden and in general game meat is probably much freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket That may be a motivation but it cannot now be Expect PETA and like organizations to use this argument to get hunting banned By cannot now be justified I guess you mean that you personally don't see any Fine but what makes your opinion so important With no legitimate hunting with the papers filled with stories of senseless murders I guess there won't be a chance in hell of building a case for the RKBA that will withstand either public opinion necessity or scientific Don't give me that silent majority wants guns crap they are and will be 'silent' No votes for RKBA no Certainly the last point is If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the incidence of violent crime they won't do these Geoff Miller Computer Centre Australian Defence Force Academy
