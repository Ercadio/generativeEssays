From Young Hoon Yoon Subject Re JFFO has gone a bit too far Morris the Cat writes Would somebody please post evidence that the gun control act of is a verbatim transcription of a nazi law The evidence is that the two laws are basically identical However, that's not evidence that one is a copy of the other There's no evidence that the GCA's authors used the nazi law as a guide Yes, they ended up with roughly the same thing, but that comes from their shared goal, disarming those menacing minorities I thought the same thing too, until JPFO's RKBA article in the latest Guns Ammo at the newstands This article makes it certain that Sen Thomas Dodd D MD back before definitely asked for a translation of the German weapons laws back then Read the article, and see what you think of JPFO's argument They note that Ted Kennedy and John Dingell are among the three of the originals left from the stuff, and they are asking that folks request of John Dingell that he introduce legislation to lift GCA ' , something which I would support whole heartedly andy Can someone post a general idea of what GCA ' does Thanks
