From John De Armond Subject FBI Murders was Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN Jim De Arras writes I have believed all along that they could not let them live the embarrassment to the BATF and the FBI would've been too Remember this was a suspicion of tax evasion There were no witnesses except the All information filtered through the All they had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the building and the press could've done their job and would've been able to back the FBI's story with close up video while incurring no risk to the Unless they did not want the public to see The complete lack of any other source of information other than the FBI really causes me Sick to my stomach and getting sicker from all the Government apologists Well put I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing Can you imagine the media outrage the lawsuits the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind What's going on here Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened I'm a student of human phychology particularly in the area of psy ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business That puts me firmly in the amateur This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh's behavior was emminently It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their It would also be typical given Koresh's religious orientation for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the IMHO the FBI knew all this and decided after days of concentrated psy ops to initiate that I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of They KNEW that sending tanks oops combat engineering vehicles obstensibly to perform gas insertions love that NewSpeak WOULD push him over the Look at some supporting Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the The FBI through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning claimed to have listening devices in the If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would at the first sign of preparations for suicide have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the Instead they continued with the gas insertion right up to the point where flames The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound gloating over the Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back abandoned the assault torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him Exploiting his ego would have been A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have He could have then been nabbed when he left the Simple clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought it was totally out of the Not without all that testesterone floating After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls Yesterday was a sad sad day for the American I am sick to my very John John De Armond Interested in high performance mobility Performance Engineering Magazine TM Interested in high tech and computers Marietta Ga Send ur snail mail address to for a free sample mag Lee Harvey Oswald Where are ya when we need ya
