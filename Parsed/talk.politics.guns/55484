From R Subject Re Gun Buy Back On Thu Apr GMT R wrote Firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and From the rkba archive Total firearm deaths for children through at is one of the SMALLEST causes of deaths in Cars falls burns drowning food ingestion are all much larger cause of deaths So firearms are the leading cause after drowning and choking on food at least for Sorry to the National Safety Council ACCIDENT FACTS In gun accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental death for children ages and I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is So guns don't kill as many children as car What is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths The difference is that a rational person would address the leading cause first and address the lesser causes That thinking is so screwed up I don't even know how to respond to A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths and not attempt to affect childhood falls drownings gunshot injuries So this so called rational person using your definition if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged through would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease injuries stroke suicide liver disease chronic lung disease homicide HIV infection or Oh okay Charles that makes a lot of I tell you what Charles I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of And you call your local police homicide department liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser Please quit wasting my time with this silly shit I've got an idea Charles why don't you start a group or group This is Don't confuse the Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another we should not try to address it I don't I'm not posting to to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their A humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a year old would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm Ignorance is our greatest Again Charles you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who like you expressed concern over making youth gun violence a I guess maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh Both would be defined as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood If that is the case I'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence What other sources of information do you have which confirms their data These folks are well known for misrepresenting the Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Sorry Charles the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the But if you insist according to the UCR Firearm murders of youngsters and under increased percent between and Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you They state that Every day American children ages and under are killed in gun accidents suicides and Many more are wounded Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry They say Gunshot wounds to children ages and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between and Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles They state that Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased from to Charles I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to If you don't realize this fact I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data or if you go into the homes schools and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself I'm not going to bother to try to convince Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political I really don't want to do or the Centers for Disease They have firearm statistics Are firearms a disease Charles it's obvious that you know nothing about the They don't just study cancer and heart I've got news for you interpersonal gun violence IS an In Surgeon General Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer heart disease or auto that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of In the lives of youths or in their schools I know a number of youths who have firearms present in their lives Is is quite appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms this is a presence right What are you trying to say This innuendo reminds me of listening to Bill WHO THE F K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE FIREARM CHARLES In the future if you are going to post to and jump into a previous discussion please read the entire posting not just sentence that you decide to respond What the hell are you saying here You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn' The CPHV reports that youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that bring GUNS to school at least once a I wouldn't trust their statistics without independent The CDC estimates that out high school students carried a gun to school at least once in Based on CPHV statistics Based on UCR Based on what The CDC also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their Therefore What is the purpose of this claim Charles buddy I'm getting really tired of Do you live on the planet Mars As a physicist I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in In addition spend a few minutes talking to these Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods whether they know anyone who has been shot whether they know anyone who has a gun whether they have ever held a gun and whether they themselves have ever been Believe me Charles THAT will be your INDEPENDENT Rodney
