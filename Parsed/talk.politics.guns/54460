From Young Hoon Yoon Subject Re Gun Talk Legislative Update for States Dan Sorenson writes Larry Cipriani writes IOWA All firearm related bills are dead Senate File dealing with off duty police officers carrying concealed remains viable The POWER of the word processor and a stamp at work The fact that around here the state rep generally lives no more than nine miles from any constituent doesn't hurt, either Dan Sorenson, DoD ISU only censors what I read, not what I say Don't blame them USENET Post to exotic, distant machines Meet exciting, unusual people And flame them Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File Does this bill allow or deny off duty police from carrying concealed From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy on CCW If S allows police off duty to carry concealed then I would be inclined to oppose it I don't believe off duty police officers should have any more rights than civilians If law or policy prevents law abiding citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off duty police officer be treated any differently
