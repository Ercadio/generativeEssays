does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed? from what information that i have, iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on ccw. if s 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then i would
be inclined to oppose it. i don't believe off-duty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians. if law or policy prevents law-abiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
officer be treated any differently.
