From andy Andy Freeman Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article Jason Kratz U writes I have been at a shooting range where gang members were practicing In article CSD andy Andy Freeman says How do we know that they were gang members and not undercover cops or even law abiding menacing BTW Why the sneer quotes We know because the area that the gun shop shooting range is in is right on the border of the west side of That is a gang infested So Kratz was there does that mean that he's a gang member Even in the most gang infested areas most of the residents ARE NOT gang that only minorities have gangs Not As far as the quotes are concerned it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for How was it obvious Were they not trying to hit the target Or does Kratz confuse marksmanship with trying to simulate a post If so that excludes self defense shooting but the rest of us understand that that exclusion would be an It excludes a lot of legit gun games as don't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start Sounds like practical pistol or maybe It also sounds like how a self defense shooter might well The only things that action excludes are hunting and like a post Kratz should get out more andy
