From Keith Marchington Subject Re Your Evil Tax Dollars at Work was RE ATF BURNS RANCH ETC Mark 'Mark' Sachs MBS wrote Oh Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places In particular three different places where there were no APV's The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins of the BD The key word is When that baby was crushed the gas would have gone all over the And when ignited would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV Ammo doesn't go up all at once kind of like fireworks going Propane gas goes off in a big Gee that's kind of consistent with what the pictorial history And if the government did start the fire then why weren't people trying to get out of the compound Remember PRESSURIZED People all over the Conflagration in less than a Huge Gas masks being worn by the Makes a lot of sense that very few of those on the inside would even know that the tank was If they thought it was just a normal fire they would probably be trying to put it Then BOOM the After that explosion and concussion I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable of And oh I don't know why I'm even Good Take an objective look at what happened listen to the things that the FBI said The BD's started the The BD's bodies were found with gunshot that are now being refuted by the evidence being Seems that the FBI is deliberately making statements that have no rational basis in fact and trying to make them sound like I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe a murderous heavily armed religious cult despite much evidence to the Thought Experiment Suppose this exact same thing happened under the Bush What would your answer be then Would you still prefer to believe the cultists Yes I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non stop string of lies and half This is consistent with their operations on numerous And as for the BD's being murderous they did not cause any problems until they were assaulted by the So now a thought experiment for you If the BATF had never stormed that farm would four agents and BD's be dead today No I don't really expect a response to that But then again that is how Clinton was elected by people who believe that his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into Um isn't that how all politicians are elected That is how politicians are Kind of scary isn't Now if we as a people actually held Clinton to his promises instead of apologizing and denying that he ever made them and actually expected accountability by our government I doubt that debacles like Waco would happen as often as they So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty people Are they like just plain evil or what Did they just wake up one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the United States to figure out who to oppress that day I'm eager to Acutally THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for Oddly enough their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after the initial raid on the BD' Coincidence I think not And as for the fire what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of The FBI tried to convince the world it was suicide but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to cover its And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader How is he on diabolical laughter Does he look good in a cape These things MUST be You Oh If you want to argue If you merely want to demean those who see this differently than you then please go somewhere Mark Sachs IS Keith Marchington
