from daryl biberdorf subject re hb passes the texas house hb is for concealed carry in texas. it provides for licensing
citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction
course (30 hours, if i remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for
4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal
character, etc. while i don't agree with all of the criteria, i feel it's high time
that pro-gun types fight the same way hci et al. do -- by getting
incremental changes in the law. daryl daryl biberdorf n5gjm d- + sola gratia + sola fide + sola scriptura
