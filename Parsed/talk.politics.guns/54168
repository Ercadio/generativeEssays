From Rick Bressler Subject Re Gun Lovers was Re My Gun is like my American Express Card iftccu Vincent Fox am Apr This isn't so maybe this is getting a bet technical but I can't A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger Depends on WHY it A double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next Assuming the cylinder WILL A revolver can be carried with the chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one Never hurts to err on the side of safety but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties it's unnecessarily I'd rather have the extra Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi Can be faster depending on Quite Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines A misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it's jammed before starting to do anything about clearing True but this is a training Most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the Some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety I do not consider this safe You must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make The series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this There are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you On the other hand I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the For example I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the An auto Jack the slide and I've had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from turning see clearing paragraph About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double This can be cleared in Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto' There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting Dropping the gun or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto take a gun smith for a In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction but as a rule when it does you're out of the The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that Vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing view of most of A real good starting place is Ayoob's The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self In general I'd agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense Most cops are notoriously indifferent to If the department isn't going to train them they aren't going to take the time on their There is no doubt that training is an The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a Many cops don't For myself I'd hate to be limited to one or the I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination what I'm wearing that day and so Like the Moderator on says buy em all That said I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is right after taking a class get a Ruger or Smith Sorry Colt Colt revolvers are ok too If this post had gone the other way I'd be arguing for
