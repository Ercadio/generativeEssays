From Oded Feingold Subject Dealing with cults a few thoughts In the wake of the Waco denouement I had email discussions with people from this In particular we discussed how cults operate why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar I include an edited account of what I The identity of my correspondents have I hope been The editing process makes the text choppy sorry about I've tried to retain the information Ellipses indicate where text was A few of the comments in parentheses are new intended to make it easier for outsiders to These notes are preliminary feel free to Cheers Oded begin included text I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS The course included cults and briefly mentioned analyzed Did some external reading too William Adorno edited a series of books on the psychology of evil mass starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY University of Chicago Press an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII and by extension in other wars in racial lynchings I don't think the books are perfect and the study of psychopathology has advanced but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first So I think they're onto How cult psychology I'm an Hope I'm not hopelessly So long as Koresh could own his people he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them away from Otherwise he'd Koresh be During the siege ex Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless Absolutely classic brainwashing As long as they believed him they'd ignore BATF FBI Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come After all if they ever left him God would catapult them straight to Hell and the combined forces of the US gummint with all the goodwill in the world doubtful couldn't save them for a If I believed it I'd stay and die too like the folks in For a prosaic analogy replace a cult leader with an estranged wife or husband and notice how many folks show up kill the ex and then That's the consequence of shattered It really does happen all the By the way the treasured ideal in such cases without which life is meaningless is the relationship no matter how abusive rather than the individual's Why No News Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation I agree that official explanations are in I can also see good reasons for news The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted yesterday those people would be alive that no matter what those people would have died because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI He held them hostage as his trump against going to jail but nothing would really stop him from offing Even if the FBI went away Look at Rep Leo Ryan and some staffers visited Jonestown at the request of constituents who had relatives Once Jonestown was discovered and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage they all killed themselves because Jim Jones knew he'd be Internal arguments asking to spare the children brought up by some of the women in the cult were shouted There are The logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is it wouldn't kill the kids was shouted down as blasphemy and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the I suspect it's the same with the Branch There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN I don't know whether it's good never read The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment or organizations buying full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill So the only way the BATF FBI could save those people and future cults is by ignoring such I suppose there's another way outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go or somehow influencing his people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the a mighty tough row to I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts noise and other sensory However maybe they're not very sophisticated or maybe the job is It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from Koresh they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them or well meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it I hate playing chess when the world screams in my face especially if at checkmate time people really die and I could be I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy unless you deny the FBI BATF Child Protective Services of whatever stripe and the rest of the gummint should exist at the end Okay have at
