Subject Re Gun Buy Back From R In article Jim De Arras writes In article R writes In article writes In article R writes buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level What gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things Evidence please Please don't misinterret what I was saying I was making the point tha there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common If you're a Research Associate in Urban Child Research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes Follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the is a serious Firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is So guns don't kill as many children as car What is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths I am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their Any death is Wanna discuss match control Firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent I hate to repeat myself Jim but like I told Joe I was not attempting in any way to justify gun You're right any death is THAT was my point to Joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a No I don't want to discuss match I don't equate a book of matches to a loaded millimeter Don't confuse the And please don't say that tired old NRA line Guns don't kill people people kill people Sure people can kill people without But easy access to guns makes it a lot more Guns don't kill people People with easy access to guns kill people More than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the In that sense I think they might do a little Please explain why you think symbolic offerings do My point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments MIGHT I stress might do a LITTLE I stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique Overall I thought that I had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were Providing false hope then is the intent Jim I'm just saying how it I'm not saying if that is a good thing or From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well So in answer to your question no false hope is not the I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or Look if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test evaluation what is the point It must be symbolic in The police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it we'll give you for we care about the community If you I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics I suspect you'll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of The CPHV reports that youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that bring GUNS to school at least once a The CDC estimates that out high school students carried a gun to school at least once in The CDC also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their California schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and Florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd These are the statistics increase in California schools eh Gun control is working fine there I didn't anything about gun control what are you talking about thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah Got news for you folks if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger Holding kids Time for a reality check These kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill Would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did Okay maybe I worded it I meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my I'm not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive Thanks for the reality check Joe its been So your religion is Does that make it his wrong Even assuming Koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on Jim listen to me I said I'M NOT RELIGIOUS WHATSOEVER do you understand Religion has nothing to do with I could care less what religion they were okay To put children in that situation is wrong pure and Difference is good Jim I am the most progressive and diverse person in the But if different is allowing kids to be exposed to tanks and tear gas then yes Jim DIFFERENT IS
