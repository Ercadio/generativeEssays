the feds *knew* that the children's health would be in danger and proceeded
under the assumption that the "motherly instinct" of the davidian women

woman's "motherly instinct" would never wash with feminists and liberals
if a republican were in the white house. i say that such an justification
could *only* come from a feminist mindset. btw - i'd read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was cs2.
the paper didn't provide any specifics about it. "guess i'm still writing..."
