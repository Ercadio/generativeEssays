From KENNEDY JAMES SCOT Subject Re BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today From article by Michael Larish In article Bill Vojak writes both of my Senators and my I also called the White House comment line was on hold for minutes so maybe LOTS of people are calling Please call your Congress Critter WH comment line NOW Just a general note I have seen several polls lately and they show a large majority a thinks that this incident was handled ok and b thinks that the FBI and BATF gave them more than enough time days to come I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if a bunch of people say it is For instance if some people go on a murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad This is an example of mob rule not a democracy a democracy in which people's rights are I hope that I've made myself clear on Make the following points Your outrage over todays And what if I'm not outraged have the right to hold any opinion that you want But let me ask you this are you outraged over this tragedy I hope that you are your opinions of David Koresh and his followers not I know I Since BATF Chief Higgens AND Janet Reno were the who signed off on this plan demand that they be fired Actually they should both be Why I'd be interested in hearing your Point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the building it came as a direct result of the actions of the FBI And the people inside including children deserved a trial instead of What I want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do I can see it o'clock FBI and BATF agents still surround the Waco compound after I don't think They gave them every They had days to surrender to proper They had attornies representing them Koresh lied time and time I don't wish them dead but you can't let it stalemate It was time to do something and the FBI and BATF What happened was unfortunate but acceptable as long as the FBI didn't set the fire intentionally Michael Larish Amateur Radio Callsign Golden Empire Amateur Radio Society GEARS California State Chico State Amateur Radio Society CSARS University Chico Butte County Sheriff's Search Rescue Scott Kennedy Brewer and Patriot Before David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the Bible through the barrel of a ATF spokesman After The ATF is a cheap thug who interprets the Constitution through the barrel of a Me BATF Cigarette Cops FBI Fuehrer's Bureau of Incineration
