From KENNEDY JAMES SCOT Subject Re BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today From article r jINN , by Michael Larish In article A Bill Vojak writes both of my Senators, and my Rep I also called the White House comment line was on hold for minutes so maybe LOTS of people are calling Please call your Congress Critter WH comment line NOW Just a general note, I have seen several polls lately and they show a large majority a thinks that this incident was handled ok and b thinks that the FBI and BATF gave them more than enough time days to come out I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if a bunch of people say it is For instance, if some people go on a murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad This is an example of mob rule not a democracy a democracy in which people's rights are protected I hope that I've made myself clear on this Make the following points Your outrage over todays behaviour And what if I'm not outraged Fine you have the right to hold any opinion that you want to But, let me ask you this are you outraged over this tragedy I hope that you are, your opinions of David Koresh and his followers not withstanding I know I am Since BATF Chief Higgens AND Janet Reno were the who signed off on this plan, demand that they be fired Actually, they should both be commended Why I'd be interested in hearing your reasons Point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the building, it came as a direct result of the actions of the FBI BATF And the people inside including children deserved a trial, instead of this What I want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do I can see it now the o'clock news FBI and BATF agents still surround the Waco compound after days I don't think so They gave them every chance They had days to surrender to proper authorities They had attornies representing them, etc Koresh lied time and time again I don't wish them dead but you can't let it stalemate forever It was time to do something and the FBI and BATF did What happened was unfortunate but acceptable as long as the FBI didn't set the fire intentionally Michael G Larish Amateur Radio Callsign KD CTZ Golden Empire Amateur Radio Society GEARS W RHC California State Chico State Amateur Radio Society CSARS University, Chico Butte County Sheriff's Search Rescue Scott Kennedy, Brewer and Patriot Before David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the Bible through the barrel of a gun ATF spokesman After The ATF is a cheap thug who interprets the Constitution through the barrel of a gun Me BATF Cigarette Cops FBI Fuehrer's Bureau of Incineration
