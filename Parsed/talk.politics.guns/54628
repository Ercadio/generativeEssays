From Robert Paull Subject Re FBI Director's Statement on Waco Standoff Nice Guy wrote The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their The BD even released the ATF agents they It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for This is the first I've heard of the BD capturing and releasing ATF Is there any more info about this Rob
