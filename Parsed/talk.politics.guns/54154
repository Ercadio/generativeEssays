From Rick Bressler Subject Re Proper gun control What is proper gun control was Re My Gun is like my American Express Card iftccu Strider pm Apr I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT You still haven't offered I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now even contributed a few comments but this stuff I'd rather face a knife than a gun has GOT to come from ignorance I used to think pretty much the same thing then I got ' ' People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how quickly you can be killed with Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick within a minute or so The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area to feet in Most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by From feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only moderate From inside feet or so a knife is a match for a DRAWN A knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out of It is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it's Criminals in general are young fast and It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of I've talked to several well trained martial They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as the Practicing with firearms requires facilities and Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth Criminals practice their knife attacks in If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker parts of your body falling off onto the A year old man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about one and a half Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in I've seen people close that distance and strike in I'm old over weight and I can do it in I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK In this case the attacker used the HANDLE not the pointed Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a Except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take ' This is true of even heart There is the case of the police woman in the first recorded survivor of a shot to the That lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it All four of her shots fired after SHE had been shot struck the Atta girl The bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized She died about six times on the operating table but was out of the hospital in days and was back on full duty in eight months She was off duty at the time and not wearing her She was on her way home so happened to have her No she doesn't think civilians should have the same The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker you'd better be planning on doing some A good alternative is to shoot for and break the People can often walk a little on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the ' Hot 's on up will usually do Remember folks the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequences for This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal or in many cases even good enough to keep us I don't want to face a violent attack of any Knowing what I now know I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an It would have to depend on the attacker and if I could pick and choose I WOULDN'T BE This is really the bottom Criminals do not fear the Criminals do not fear the They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it
