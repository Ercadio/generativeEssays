From Subject Re RKBA on NYC radio station Actually the real reason that Stern was getting a bigger rating share was that he was new in not because of the quality if you can call it that of his After the Fine was issued he started to get better ratings because of the curious individuals who wanted to see how bad he actually Since he came to he has had a greater turn over of listeners than the Grease In other words more people get sick of him sooner than they do of the Grease After all saying vagina or penis on the air is hilarious at first the second time it is still a little funny but when you do it all the time and at the same time think you are the greatest man on the planet and tell everyone so than you are going to get old really Give it up Mark you are Excuse me but if you really new what the show was about you'd know that he doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his He also addresss real issues as well as being I don't hear any of these other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the same time he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are WRONG and by the way if he is such a flash in the pan why do his ratings sustain so well Hmm Greg Lazar J E T S JETS JETS JETS
