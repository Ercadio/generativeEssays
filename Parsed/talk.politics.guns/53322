From fcrary Frank Crary Subject Re Gun Control was Re We're Mad as Hell at the TV News In article Steve Manes writes That's all very well and good but I was refering to all homocides not just ones involving handguns what is this fixation on death by shooting as if it were somehow worse than death by stabbing What relevance are ALL homicides in this debate The issue is guns not baseball The issue is reducing crime not If gun control doesn't lower crime overall then is doesn't address the a simpleton knows that he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun and rarely shoot their A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate So while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun criminals are more likely to actually use the knife as opposed to threatening the victim with It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce Stabbings might just become more That's why it is important to look at the overall not the with gun homicide It avoids the issue of substitution different criminal techinques of using different weapons and measures what we want to prevent As for knives see my earlier I'd much rather face a knife than a gun Face However facing knife welding attackers isn't too common Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual Very few criminals shoot from cover It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your Overall I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a the best defense against a knife isn't another Anyone trained in unarmed self defense won't have much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife assault which probably means of knife assailants Actually the exact same statement is true of guns Training in unarmed self defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much You also ignore the criminal's reaction The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals unarmed armed with a knife gun or whatever are unwilling to risk their lives in a If faced with a serious threat almost all prefer to leave and find an easier Therefore using or threatening to use as is much more commonly the case a weapon is the best defence against an attacker regardless of how he is Knives however are much less effective than guns Criminals don't consider knifes as a serious threat nearly as often as they do Frank Crary CU Boulder
