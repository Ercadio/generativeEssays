From Scott W Roby Subject Re BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today In article fiddler steve hix writes In article Scott W Roby writes Why didn't they release the children weeks ago It would have been inconsistent behavior for them to have done Some people believe that there is more to life than the physical These folks believed that the generally held standards of the surrounding community heck most of the world were morally wrong and letting the children be abandoned to this godless unbelieving culture would be condeming them to eternal loss and separation from By their standards letting the children go would be abandoning them to a fate literally worse than The FBI and BATF and media people working on the issue I suspect just couldn't get their heads into a similar enough to say nothing of identical mode of thinking to realize what they were Physically there was no reason why the BD's shouldn't have given up and come out a long time From the point of view of the BD's they were up against the wall and had nowhere to go at They apparently really did love their kids too much to abandon them to a godless bunch of the end result was horribly I didn't say the BD's were right I just said that that's the way they perceived Koresh was a nutcase and a bunch of other people paid for And the FBI and BATF miscalculated and misunderstood what was going on from the word Very likely Reminds me of the movie The Rapture Some things are too important not to give away to everybody else and have none left for Dieter the car salesman
