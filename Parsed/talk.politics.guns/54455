From Ron Phillips Subject Re Armed Citizen April ' In article A , Colin Kendall writes In article A writes THE ARMED CITIZEN Mere presence of a firearm, without a shot being fired, prevents crime in many instances, as shown by news reports sent to The Armed Citizen Perhaps so, but note that of the accounts cited, there was only one in which no shot was fired Of the other twelve, five described cases in which the assailant was wounded by a shot, and six described cases in which the assailant was killed by a shot And, had not these citizens accepted the moral responsibility to protect their own lives, there could well have been at least innocent victims lying dead and several criminals still out walking the streets perpetrating their crimes on others Ron Phillips Senior Customer Engineer Intergraph Electronics East Evelyn Avenue VOICE Mountain View, CA FAX
