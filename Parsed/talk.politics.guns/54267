From PA David Veal Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article CMM Thomas Parsli writes Overall Crime rate It like Two questions When was this and do you have the relevant Please note this is not in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct but when the drop occured is Acquiring weapons in Norway You can buy almost all kinds of weapons in Norway BUT you must have a permit and a good reason to get the If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun The primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do is that it makes guns a play thing and tool of the rich and It discriminates against the Is self defense considered appropriate and if so under what conditions Are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and or records of SERIOUS mental This has been suggested in the and generally supported among gun What many object to is that many if not most proposals contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even if you qualify in every Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun club for months BEFORE I could collect my It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed At this point it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the is for the most part nothing like its European I understand getting one is far more difficult there than In the it's a But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different For instance in the a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public It is not necessary to own one or to operate it on private That is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public A permit to own an automobile for instance which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property but in restricting activity on private Use of guns in crimes in Norway Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' for a long time but these are rather the Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the Use of knives It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or 'open' You Americans think it's ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth This varies widely One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the has fifty unique jurisdictions where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another Some places allow open carry of both guns and Some allow Some prohibit both or allow one or the And it can be either a state or local Individual vs masses Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others The question must be asked Is the right of this individual affecting the rights of this other What we usually get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting the rights of some other If for instance Bob were using his gun to attack Steve you'd have a But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by The issue I believe the issue is GUNS and gun The issue is crime violence and The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in But should it have to be like that Of course It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt But currently we don't have that Nor do I expect we Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy some states No state In any case there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's wisdom on Freedom in general is an unwise If you pre emptively restrict everything which might be unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless If you believe it's smart neccacery to have drivers licence WHY do you think it should be free to buy guns I'll raise my hand against driver's As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents But as I mentioned they're two different David Veal of of Education Services
