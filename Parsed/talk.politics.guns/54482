From Peter Cash Subject Raid justification was Blast them next time In article Francis Chiu writes Initial assault on the compound more like a wooden farm house if it burned to the ground like it did for WHAT Regardless of who started caused the fire NONE of this would have happened if the ATF can HONESTLY justify their initial assault and handled it properly I just got through listening to the o'clock news on Channel here in They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after months of investigation for their I couldn't believe the junk on this list For example the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of and ammunition that can be used in and assault rifles Imagine that they had ammunition They also had aluminum dust Yeah it's a component of thermite but so far I haven't heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M grenade Anybody know about this Months of investigation For this people died Die Welt ist alles was Zerfall Peter Cash apologies to Ludwig Wittgenstein
