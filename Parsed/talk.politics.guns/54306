From Dan Swartzendruber Subject Re Ax the ATF A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight The explanation we were given at least at one point was that they thought the cult members would be at religious My only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi military unit you'd better understand basic military One cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect the operation will fail We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were outgunned they didn't expect such heavy When questioned about why such an overwhelming military style assault was planned we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily Can you say contradictory I knew you could The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs I'm more than ever convinced that's right on An anecdote not related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up some of the evidence in the World Trade Center There's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the FBI will not be admissible in This is not I was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI His opinion of the BATF was ummm well let's just say I have still not been presented with one iota of evidence that the BD's had any of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the reason for the raid in the first BTW we're still hearing this AG Reno on CNN yesterday made references to this issue without any She also waved around the He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children A point re the Feds in general their handling of the whole siege reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought processes of the AG Reno said they pushed the button because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the My only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to the edge what the hell did she think their reaction would be to an hours long assault on the compound where holes were punched in the walls and CS gas pumped in If I were a BD I'd expect the forces of the godless government to assault me at any In that light whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones Kool Aid is Also look at how the siege was conducted Bright lights loud rock music cutting off communications and other contact with the All measures designed to make the BD's feel more and more isolated and This might have been a great strategy if they were dealing with As it was it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's paranoid include std Dan
