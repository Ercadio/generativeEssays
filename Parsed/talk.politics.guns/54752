From Dan Hartung Subject ABC Confirms Two Points of FBI's Version Well the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the compound has been ABC aired a report including the tapes from The FBI called within minutes of the fire's Unfortunately dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief who was not available literally out to lunch the operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out By the time trucks arrived minutes later the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little too late there were just two pumpers and no water The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco from Georgia asking if anything was being Civic minded but probably irresponsible if everyone watching television did that no local calls could get ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound not just the standard pool shot and agreed that the fire a must have been started in at least places and b must have had an accelerant to spread so Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the theories floating around the Score FBI Branch Or is that Branch Davidians The Koresh cult standoff is over may his victims Recquiescat in Pace the above is a of silence Daniel Hartung Ask me about Rotaract
