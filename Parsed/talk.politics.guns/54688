From andy SAIL Stanford EDU Andy Freeman Subject Re CLINTON JOINS LIST OF GENOCIDAL SOCIALIST LEADERS I've yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambell's soup and M 's AR 's and banging marrying thirteen yuear olds With one exception, that's a pretty good description of many of the Baptists I know The exception is that they know the difference between an M and an AR Heck they even know that it looks like Richard Petty's stock car doesn't mean it's a racing stock car They may be uncouth, but they've figured out that appearance isn't function andy
