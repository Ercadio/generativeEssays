From Jim De Arras Subject Re Gun Buy Back In article R writes In article writes In article R writes buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level What gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things Evidence please Please don't misinterret what I was saying I was making the point tha there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common If you're a Research Associate in Urban Child Research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes Follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the is a serious Firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is So guns don't kill as many children as car What is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths I am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their Any death is Wanna discuss match control Firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the More than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the In that sense I think they might do a little Please explain why you think symbolic offerings do My point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments MIGHT I stress might do a LITTLE I stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique Overall I thought that I had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were Providing false hope then is the intent I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics I suspect you'll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of The CPHV reports that youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that bring GUNS to school at least once a The CDC estimates that out high school students carried a gun to school at least once in The CDC also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their California schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and Florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd These are the statistics increase in California schools eh Gun control is working fine there thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah Got news for you folks if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger Holding kids Time for a reality check These kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill Would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did Okay maybe I worded it I meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my I'm not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive Thanks for the reality check Joe its been So your religion is Does that make it his wrong Even assuming Koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on Rodney Jim I'm always rethinking There's never been a day when I haven't rethought But I can't do that by Bill Clinton April If I were an American as I am an Englishman while a foreign troop was landed in my country I never would lay down my arms never never never WILLIAM PITT EARL OF CHATHAM
