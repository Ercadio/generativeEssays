From Vincent Fox Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In Jason Kratz U writes deleted And as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city gang Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming The majority that I see are still carrying Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I mean semi auto handguns you're going to be at a disadvantage even with I have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing They were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren't doing too badly The University cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the Chicago It seems most state cops Define armed better Go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the Colt Does one fires faster than the other Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just YOU trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose This is why the military is limiting it's M now to round burst Simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful A revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger A double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next A revolver can be carried with the chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi Can be faster depending on A misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it's jammed before starting to do anything about clearing Most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the Some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety I do not consider this safe You must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a There are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old Too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they Not that Glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay I do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a Gun control is hitting what you aim If you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a I own a Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime Why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often Well actually some police prefer the much heftier Magnum but ObPlea Don't flame me I prefer semi autos for most But they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone If everything had gone as planned everything would have been BATF spokesperson on CNN regarding failed raid attempt in
