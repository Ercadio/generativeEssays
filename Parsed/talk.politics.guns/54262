From Jason Kratz U Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article CSD andy Andy Freeman says In article Jason Kratz U All your points are very well taken and things that I haven't considered as I am not really familiar enough with That's not all that Kratz doesn't Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched The only thing that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on Sure there is that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a Now we know that Kratz doesn't understand what a safety is supposed to He also confuses things he can see with things that exist Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to It's basic purpose not to let the gun fire until you're Christ I've known that since I had my first Crosman air You don't know me so don't make assumptions about what I know and don't I do know that the Glock has multiple safties from reports looking at them at a gun shop and friends who own A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's what the user With Glocks one says I want the gun to go off by pulling the If the safeties it has make that work it has a real safety no matter what Kratz andy From the things I have read heard Glocks are always knocked because of the trigger They are supposedly harder to learn to use Every article that I have read can't be wrong about the damn And don't ask me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and or articles laying Boy you can't make a simple statement on here without someone getting right on your No wonder why there are so many problems in the Everyone takes everything just a little too By the way I'm not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore as someone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to And yes I know that I had something to do with that Jason
