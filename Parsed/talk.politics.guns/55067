From KENNEDY JAMES SCOT Subject Re Waco survivors April From article by Phill Hallam Baker In article Andrew Merritt writes Path dscomsa dxcern mcsun uknet pipex uunet apm From Andrew Merritt In article writes stuff about British cult members deleted What exactly are you trying to say And why were there no fire engines within a mile of the compound Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with amunition that has a range of They were using caliber ammunition not would be a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the Besides the ranch house not fort apocalypse it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says was on fire The Gun loonies couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the The bastards waited until the fire was well under way before they called the fire department in They didn't even tell the fire department to be on I sincerely hope that the FBI ATF Attorney General Janet Reno and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly Someone should pay for this needless tragic waste of human Sadly these evil SOBs will probably never face The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's Sadder still the American people will probably believe Next The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first This is not the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every If people decide to own guns and live in one place together then that is their On the other hand if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their But the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any David Koresh was accused of abusing children but if this is his only crime then the presence of the ATF can't be The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms tobacco and alcohol ATF agents are basically cigarette should stay out of other kinds of law enforcement actions that are out of their Better yet they should be s tcanned The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an If the FBI had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the Sounds like something the SS would Human life children and adults alike should be treated with respect even if they are heavily armed religious wackos David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out It really was a no win Koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the ATF Instead he ordered the murder of the Don't be so sure about I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on This cult member also said that David Koresh had no intentions of committing mass David Koresh's lawyer also confirms Therefore if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE Even if this is not true the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire Perhaps they wanted all these people to In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder The Koresh gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue For all practical purposes they were unarmed the B D followers had automatic You're wrong on several ATF agents were adequately They had AR and Some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all The ATF's initial claim which they later retracted that agents were underarmed is simply The B D seige could not be allowed to go on The B D were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective that would have been very risky orders of magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Airplanes and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged Rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too Can you think of a better way of getting the children out A certain way The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government This is simply It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as That would require them to come up with a solution Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation Gun control isn't the only issue If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f ed up they What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s t like they did in are becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the This greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got of its agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of Texas being shot at by religious Still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage No govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully The blame does not rest on the FBI it rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far in particular the person who tipped the B D off in advance has the murder of ATF agents and children on his or her There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed The fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first The next WACO may not be religious nutters but a political A splinter group of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them No other government in the world has faced such a this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little Phill Hallam Baker Scott Kennedy Brewer and Patriot Before David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the Bible through the barrel of a
