corresponds to one Reading right to left the fields are the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in bytes and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned To get a file run the command get followed by the name of the file you want for example get INDEX or get noduty After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this Transfer bytes received in seconds Kbytes s You can repeat the get command for every file you want to You can use the mget command to retreive multiple If the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress get Once you're finished you can log off with the command quit If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little First of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba For example File whitemanslaw White Man's Law by William Tonso from the December Reason magazine Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above Once you are in the incoming directory use the command put file name In this case put whitemanslaw Again there'll be a Transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds Now your file is on the archive Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file names Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file or you'll get an error message Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know If you have
