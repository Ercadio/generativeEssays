From Tavares Subject Re The 'pill' for Deer No Hunting In article writes You might have missed the News World Report excerpt I It is fairly consistant with other such polls finding that approximately of households have at least one OK a near majority actually OWN firearms but I will still claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even threaten anyone with to self defense incidents a YEAR doesn't count with you What do they do right or are they just lucky Maybe they're just If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston chances are almost certain that she won't be counted as one of those self defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner In either case this means the 'average threat level' in this country is rather Ironic words for somebody who lives in The average threat level in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your Come on up to Boston or NYC or Washington DC and see how much diddlysquat the average threat level in the country means to a resident I think you have weapons on the I never said that these alternative means of self protection involved any Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' It isn't because every person is armed to the It is because of attitude and In the 'good' neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking 'Good' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime watch' to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the When hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say THAT'S the one officer He was robbing Jones' house Sometimes this Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into I've misplaced the original text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang Sure enough a few nights later there was a drive by performed at the resident's Except that this time unlike in LA the entire street came out and returned fire putting an end to the car's The gang packed up and Of course in LA or in a place like Florida after the hurricane your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell In short the alternative to firepower is gangs or at least a benificent manifestation of that social Replace lead with flesh the flesh makes a better conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a block Look nobody is arguing I have a fire extinguisher at That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches on the I live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue cleaned twice a year and test my smoke alarms But if DESPITE all this a fire does start it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the But legality and legitimacy also If a government's charter makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the basis for its Enforcement of its will becomes a matter solely of force of Oliver The man is positively worshiped in many all American 'conservative' He and Big Ron set up a secret government and did all sorts of severely illegal deeds the kind of stuff you and I would be doing twenty to life for yet he walks This BS happens all the In fact it happens so much that no one really cares 'Legitimacy' is a non Legality is a non So long as we get T bones and our MTV who gives a rats ass You seem to be agreeing with your You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators white collar blue collar epauletted or tank Ultimately no one has the power to enforce your rights but Unless you've given up that I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical aspects of the Pure emotion like the abortion Too many people fit that category that is Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T You seem content to underestimate the electorate I'm willing to try to raise their Argue away you can't I think we HCI was founded in what In the mid 's they ran a One Million Strong campaign for two years before reaching this My understanding is that they reached it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues paying I can't speak authoritatively on this maybe somebody else has Then they started running a Two Million Strong campaign for a while but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of In just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings the starting point of the modern gun control movement the NRA had a mere By barely after the first murmurs of future registration it had about a Today it has over three million members making it the third largest membership organization in the country next to AARP and AAA And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous Historical figures from Kukla's Gun Control and As you say many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T bones and That leaves hard core gun owners against hard core gun I know a number of ex HCI members who have recently become NRA I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other Yes I think we can and will win this Firearms related mindless mayhem will be related to the availibility of If they become scarce and and expensive a different psychology will take I think they would be used far less to settle trivial I think they would be used far less to hammer nails as well but like you I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal If you can I'm If you believe that I speak for my company OR write today for my special Investors'
