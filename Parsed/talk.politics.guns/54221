From Strider Subject Re guns in backcountry no thanks Paul Reimer writes There are a lot of automobile accidents but atleast there is some regulation to try to combat When I got my drivers license I HAD to take a drivers safety I HAVE to be licensed to My car MUST be I MUST at least where I live have liability insurance on both myself driving and my car if someone else had an accident with it Hmm wouldn't manditory saftey classes registration of both the owner and gun and manditory liability insurance be nice for gun As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now none of the above measures are required for you on your own property You do not have to have a license your car does not have to be registered or inspected and you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes when you own and operate that vehicle on your own If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy at least make it And by the way in Texas you can drive a car in public with the proper credentials but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his her So I won't even consider registration manadatory safety classes or manadatory liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local state and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment and a non discretionary federal weapons carry permit good anywhere in the United Come on you wanted the Mike Ruff This above all to thine own S T R I D E R self be Polonius Those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor Franklin
