From Jason Kratz U Subject Re What to do if you shoot somebody In article Jason 'Think ' Steiner says Jason Kratz U writes Say you're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on You give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their action anyway and you end up shooting and killing My question is what do you do Should you stay and wait for the cops or should you collect your brass if you're using a semi auto and get out of there provided of course you don't think that you have been seen What kind of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation What would be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and it was a first offense What would happen if you took off but someone saw you and you were caught do you have any idea how much trouble you'd get into for taking off like that leaving the scene of an auto accident is bad enough killing someone leaving is times who's going to seriously believe it was self defense when you took the time to collect your spent casings But officer I reload Well like someone said in a reply to this it really all depends on the area that you live See David Veal's reply to I have heard exactly the same thing that he said in his reply to fade away if you think that you haven't been seen I heard this from a police officer For the record though he was talking about in Tennessee not even if you could get away with it you're still a do it nice legal keep your law abiding status send your story into the Armed Citizen column of American jason Jason
