From Dan Sorenson Subject Re guns Amex AND new Thomas Parsli writes Remember me Tom I hope you'll respond and I seem to be a Voice of Reason or some such I've been recieving fan mail so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late and hope to make a few points I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them and especially to many in wrong And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don' A fairly simple problem given our size and Do you agree We all believe criminals particularly violent criminals should not have The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast Nobody here seems to be able to do it and I doubt anybody in Norway can Thus we are left with a philosophical difference does the safety of a few justify restricting the many We say no while others say Now IF you would like to reduce the number how would you do it without affecting good responcible gun owners Can you provide a method that cannot be abused I doubt I DO believe in a persons What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for Of This is not in What is in contention is how much one has to MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals and that you HAVE to give 'a little' to make that society It is this giving a little that makes Americans We have seen this argument You might remember how a Chamberlain gave a little to a particular fascist short asshole and how such appeasement While it might work in some instances it doesn't work in others and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of Cars and guns should really not be mixed I just tried to make a Like America Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b so a car is essential in most Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway so we don't argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a Thus cars are not essential for your However the arguments presented show that since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does How one defines essential often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that When we look at the raw data such comparisons are not individually EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and could be avoided if there were more guns in Germany in the 's PLEASE read some HISTORY This depends upon what the populace was willing to As Desert Storm proved even an armed populace won't just revolt even when given a Still would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace We have to wonder as some of his first acts were to confiscate Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the Thus we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a One can argue both sides one also has to live with each Is this discussion about Banning weapons for ALL Americans or Making it harder for criminals to get one It is about but so far all proposals to curtail have wound up enforcing as I only wish that or was so Change of That was on my part purely in I merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially but of wholly different backgrounds I thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other Child abuse for instance BATF can only enforce gun tobaccco alcohol Child abuse is a matter for the individual states and local Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the hierarcy Some seems rather mis unInformed That hierarchy is a paid for feed at many Most people do not get it for this reason and I suspect money not censorship is the main Do you get at your site I can't read it here because of censorship and legal fears so again our differences You have topless sunbathing and in the USA we can watch a murder every fifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on Dan Sorenson DoD ISU only censors what I read not what I Don't blame USENET Post to exotic distant Meet exciting unusual And flame
