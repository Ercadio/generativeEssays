From Dan Sorenson Subject Re Nuclear heavy weapons and the Militia Long fcrary Frank Crary writes Down to some odd We must be making progress On an ironic note where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message Garbage Think it's trying to tell me something Dan Sorenson writes And thank you It's a great change from the same tired old You lurkers can join in at any time you know the kindler gentler Who would have thought No not exactly The only reason for this sort of restriction is the possible endangerment of A poorly maintained rifle is dangerous but only to the user since it doesn't endanger others there is no justification for such I remind you of I consider ' a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the My point was at what distance or level of threat we draw the Is it the endangerment of others so we do a ' restriction or the possibility of being shot hence we draw a mile restriction or a nuke and draw a mile restriction To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the Perhaps Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to protect their homes and Using nuclear weapons close to home will not accomplish I disagree on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was If this is not the case the tactical and strategic implications change quite a Personally my home is worth say twenty Martians intent on taking over the My family All of The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my There is however another problem In any case of civil war the strength of the militias fighting on each side should reflect the popular If the public is split versus then the minorities' militias should be at a Such a need for popular support would hopefully prevent insurrections unless the people really were behind the But heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia could distort this What if the minority included all the tank and artillery owners That seems to be the case already given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the With such low numbers obviously due to cost I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior Furthermore it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in I think it is vital to avoid such a situation where a small minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power through To prevent this it may be necessary to give control of heavy weapons those which only a small number of individuals would own and whose firepower would grossly distort the relation between popular support and military strength to someone other that individual This is certainly not a good thing but I think it is the lesser of two Whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body responsive to the will of the I had envisioned that the armorer perhaps the officers of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex But if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it Follow orders from the officers Since the expense of a tank is so large though chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and Here I think we have to be carefull about which state we are talking about Certainly one role of the militia is to overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely destructive to that end for that same government to control the militia's But the United States have several levels of government each able to act independently but not all likely targets of As such rebelions against state and local governments are very I think therefore that the state or possibly local governments could safely be allowed to keep the select militia's heavy The risk of abuse while still something to consider is far less than the similar risk were the federal government in This I'll agree with to a The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally Keep them spread out such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so Otherwise I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed The select militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly trained For the reasons I have outlines above I think these heavy weapons tanks artillery aircraft are better off being kept by local governments than by a small number of However local governments shouldn't be able to use the select militia without the support to the Ideally the general militia under the direct control of the people and the select militia under the direction of democratic local governments would opperate But even in the worst case the general militia should be able to functional without the select Similarly the select militia should be incapable of action without the aid of the general I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons fairly few in numbers could not be easily wielded by a few people with government Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the I think a better mix is called But I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry Consider then the effect of removing the National Guard's infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local The government controled select militia could not fight effectively without infantry support provided by the general militia an inherently infantry On the other hand the general militia could function although at a disadvantage without the backing of local governments and the select We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government controlled forces and if they've all the equipment an infantry force the size would be in I'd like to see that heavy stuff say tanks offset by the local troups having a few 's and anti tank weapons in their These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy a mechanized infantry unit is what builds dikes in times of flood sets up disaster relief cities and the I would much rather see these things handled by the local general So would I but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well Thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of the select militia as I thought I was considering them to be the heavy weapons armor arm of the militia not the infantry arm of the regular Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different I think main battle tanks self propelled artillery and and up field pieces are heavy troop carriers ton trucks HumVee's old tanks Howitzers are more the stuff of a mechanized Actually this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti tank capability in the local Similarly local units would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response means mechanized Finally the militia is more than just Equipment is needed for other The Federal army I'm convinced should have a very minumum of infantry relying on the state and local militias for these Dan Sorenson DoD ISU only censors what I read not what I Don't blame USENET Post to exotic distant
