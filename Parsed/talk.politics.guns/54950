From cathy Cathy Smith Subject NO SURRENDER Lenda Jackson NO SURRENDER Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver April It is a fact of modern life that urban residents particularly women feel A certain number of them actually are There are immediate threats the things that women will tell you they're afraid The noise downstairs at The lonely walk to the The stranger at the The abusive husband finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their The The And what are we told is the solution Get a Keep the door Call the as a next to last resort learn martial and always there's the implied question what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you But what if you don't like dogs Like living alone Don't have years to devote learning judo What if after examining the facts a woman learns that rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed and were less likely to be injured Kleck than those using any other form of resistance Kleck also true for robbery assault Kleck What if to our horror and despair we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection they usually respond after a crime has been In truth the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual only the whole As a society are we going to ask women once again to sacrifice themselves Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves Here's a Neil Smith in his book The Probability Broach says no pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things But if a woman decides to protect herself with the easiest most efficient means possible people especially other women are Eughh how could you I'd be terrified they How could you hurt someone They'll repeat the lie it'll just get taken away from In truth of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking the gun away from the Kleck Well despite the lies and the social pressure some of us have already made that hard We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers burglars or We're buying more guns than every We're learning how to use them and teaching others women and men how to use Most importantly we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own We're taking our own security literally into our own We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE But there's another threat more insatiable than any mugger more secretive than any burglar more soul destroying than any That menace is government and it threatens us We know that governments throughout time have suppressed rights and oppressed It's the way they In our names and with our money it interferes with innocent people both at home and It lies to us cheats us steals from us and threatens us with No one knows exactly what it'll do next what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides it's for your own safety or we know best Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual But this monster called government persists and And we who should be its masters have become its unwilling Do you doubt me Then why did you file your income tax Like any reasonable person I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after And make no mistake they're after you and they're after Their names are familiar Brady and Reynolds Groff Metzenbahm Moynihan and If we're lucky they'll settle for our assault rifles our shotguns our handguns and our As citizens we have only two They are the same two choices given to women to surrender or to Surrender leads to the gulag to the genocide of Pol Pot to the disappearances to I do not intend to A battle can be philosophical or political in the main the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of But if they have to they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of As a patriot I will point out the error in the government's I will do my best to vote the villains out of I will protest and write and speak and teach our children justice honor and And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and it can lead to Tiananmen When the time comes to stand up if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future I intend to be And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a My opinions are of course my
