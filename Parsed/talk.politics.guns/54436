From James Barker Subject NRA address Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA I'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the amendment to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they did in After all from what I know of the Federalist papers it is this kind of tyranny the amendment was supposed to be designed to protect Honestly M tanks against the civilian population Attack helicopters We need the right to keep and bear anti tank Actually if they intend to mass armour against the weakly armed at that civilian population we need the right to field tactical Government tyranny Who would have ever thought it would happen here I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next because the SUSPECTS child Maybe yours Maybe mine And what is an Illegal Weapon which they have yet to show us if the amendment is designed to do what I believe it is and the uses tanks against you Government self serving Not Time was when the used armour attack helicopters against small Now we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a half of First they came for the Jews but I did not stop them because I was not a Jew Then they came for the catholics but I did not stop them because I was not a catholic Then they came for the lutherans but there was now no one left to stop them Martin probably didn't get it verbatim but you get the idea If the NRA reads this then never mind about the God save us James Barker Portland State University
