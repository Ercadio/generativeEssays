From Dan Hartung Subject Re The Truth about Waco John De Armond writes Nothing could at this What WOULD have gone a long way toward convincing me would have been media video particularly from diverse IMHO if the government didn't have anything to hide they would have allowed cameras near the compound from the I agree I saw no reason they could not have had close in pool cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or Points made by Dick DeGueran Koresh's lawyer The tanks were NOT pumping CS gas but were ejecting exploding canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls before Okay their word against the FBI's at this See ya in court The tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people at great Dear They could have COME The construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that were very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as shields against the government's Okay they were living in a fire That they Said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills and that the supplies they had on hand were for No crime irrelevant either Their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible study and some were sleeping when the fire was Ah yes that is exactly what I would Hold Bible Take a Always a wise course of action when you're being There was no group instruction of any kind from Koresh or his aids after the tank invasion referring to any kind of suicide pact or counter assault I don't believe there was a suicide pact I believe that Koresh wanted a fiery conflagration which he may not have told his In fact this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' Everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was Yes that's And once the whole compound was demolished where did they expect to go Women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the building and distorting the The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS That's almost as bad as running into a Hallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for the fire and trapped almost everyone in His experts have told him that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear to have started at several places at Hm an interesting We'll Koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to be in his floor room with some of his More Bible study no Hey it's a priority The texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies recovered so far had bullet wounds directly contradicting the FBI's Actually on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' We'll know more In any event it's The survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten out they would have that they were trapped by the tank destroyed building and the speed of the For six hours they were trapped The building was not destroyed They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY The underground bunker cited by the FBI as the place Koresh could have put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access Six hours to move it Or COME Dick said that he had sat in Koresh's bedroom talking to him and had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without air condition or other luxuries directly contradicting the FBI's claim that he lived in Irrelevant PR one way or the other but no crime or innocence Dick saw bullet holes in Koresh's room made from the outside in which indicates the BATF was indiscriminately shooting down through the No word on whether they were being fired back at which is an operative question The fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over Coleman Lanterns that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted through though none of the survivors saw the fire For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at any point and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN Near BALES OF Every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the FBI about starting the fire hearing someone say the fire was lit or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the It's ultimately irrelevant who lit the They had ample opportunity to He said when he first met Koresh in the compound he expected to find a raving lunatic but instead found a rational charming and intelligent young man and was very surprised by that Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent They tend to be excellent actors and skilled Ted Koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against Medical assistance was jsut a phone call Gee all he had to do was COME Women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids that were appointed as nicely as Koresh' Not relevant to any Dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time did he ever see any signs of While he was Anyway outsiders RARELY see It's a secretive All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case and the mistrial in No one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any The people who were murdered in the fire were there by their own By their OWN He called for an independent If ever there were a need for one this is Looks like there will be several investigations starting with Congressional committee hearings next His closing comments were They don't look upon themselves as a They view themselves as highly religious They sincerely believe what they And who am you or I to judge that as wrong His last sentence says it Who the hell ARE we or the government to judge their religion as This event I hope will be recorded in history as the American These people were murdered by the US government just as surely as the jews were by the I hang my head in shame for what I've allowed my government to I have NEVER judged them by their religion but by their If they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would have been no raid no siege and no Instead they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID if not The first was to stockpile The second was to shoot federal The third was to stay Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this The Koresh cult standoff is over may his victims Recquiescat in Pace the above is a of silence Daniel Hartung Ask me about Rotaract
