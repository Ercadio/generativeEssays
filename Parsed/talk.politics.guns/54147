From Morris the Cat Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city gang Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming The majority that I see are still carrying Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I mean semi auto handguns you're going to be at a disadvantage even with I have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing They were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren't doing too badly The University cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the Chicago It seems most state cops I don't know where you are originally from David but you live in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news and in the I think the situation is just a tad different here than However don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock which is not approved for carry Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka who happened to let off a stray round of This is the same anti gun police chief that wanted full auto Uzis for his patrol Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest a close to reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a reliable I note that in Germany where certainly the semi auto handgun is king some of the more elite police types want I don't think the issue is cost because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least Your presumption of disadvantage I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops there the cops usually come out on top with their standard Spl I've seen S Ws Rugers and Beretta in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago in the past I've seen others have seen Browning Hi Jason
