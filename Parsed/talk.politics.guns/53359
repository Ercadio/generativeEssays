From Brandon Ray Subject Re Statement of Sarah Brady Regarding Texas State Carrying Concealed Legislation In a previous article nigel allen says Here is a press release from Handgun Control Statement of Sarah Brady Regarding Texas State Carrying Concealed Legislation To State Desk Contact Susan Whitmore of Handgun Control WASHINGTON March Following is a statement of Sarah Brady regarding Texas state carrying concealed legislation A handful of lawmakers in Austin today have told the public that their safety is of less importance than the interests of the National Rifle This action comes as local state and federal law enforcement officials continue their stand off with a religious cult that has highlighted the need for tougher gun laws not weaker ones like the carry concealed A handful of anti gun zealots are telling the public that their right to self defense is of less importance than the interests of Handgun Control This action comes as local state and federal law enforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian compound an assault which has already resulted in the death of one two year old child at the hands of federal This has highlighted the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children against the excesses of their own Any suggestion by proponents that this bill will help to reduce crime is a distortion of the facts at This so called crime fighting law has resulted in a percent increase in violent crime in the state of Florida and I have never heard law enforcement officials bragging that more guns on the streets is the way to reduce Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a distortion of the facts at The aggressive outreach by officials in central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in the level of assault and rape in that Of course this program is a rare gem as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an unarmed citizenry will be easier to control and thus favor tighter The vote today is an insult to the law enforcement officials who are putting their lives on the line every day to end the standoff in The entire country now knows just how easy it is for an individual bent on destruction to amass an arsenal of Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total disregard for those law officials on the front lines and the families of those who have The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their lawful The entire country knows how vulnerable the average citizen is both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our own Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total understanding for those innocent law abiding citizens on the front lines and the families of those who have I urge the House of Representatives to listen to the percent of Texans that oppose this measure and reject this ill conceived I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs of their constituents and not be stampeded by ill conceived arguments from ideological Nigel Allen Toronto Ontario Canada Remote Systems Toronto Ontario Ain't propaganda fun The opinions expressed by the author are insightful intelligent and very carefully thought It is therefore unlikely that they are shared by the University of Iowa or Case Western Reserve
