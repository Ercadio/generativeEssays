From Jason Kratz U Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article PA PA David Veal says stuff deleted me What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city gang Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming The majority that I see are still carrying Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I mean semi auto handguns you're going to be at a disadvantage even with David This is the arms race That somehow bigger guns make an individual The problem is that for each corresponding level of offensive power the is not an automatic level of defense The problem is that there's a sort of lethality threshold that once you get past you're only talking about a metter of Regardless of what cops are up against there's really no reason for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him as a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the I mean think about Carrying a monster pistol or sub machinegun doesn't make the cop any less wounded if somebody shoots A lot of police departenments have switched to semi automatics as better more reliable weapons and more stopping power but there's a point of diminishing This is a very very good Who cares what kind of gun you've got if you're lying on the ground And as far as automatics go any gang member carrying around a couple of automatics an incredible rarity is going to be far more of a menace to himself and innocent bystanders than anything he might be tryinh to aim One auto is hard enough to Anybody who could control two is going to get the police officer regardless of what the police officer is armed more stuff mostly mine My question is this What would a police officer gain from having a sub machinegun or similar personal weapon that he already doesn't have with a or semi automatic pistol I don't see as how the police should be hosing around full auto fire nor has my experience with police officers or the stats regarding how many police officers get killed by other cops made me feel such would be a good Precise fire is far more Nor should they using bigger Most standard sidearms have more then sufficient stopping power when properly All more powerful weapons would do is make the likelihood of death higher without really giving police significantly more Another very good point that is well It seems that when lots of lead is flying either the cops or the gangs someone innocent always gets caught in the David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I'm beginning to think you don't love me Weird Al All points made above are well I guess I am in the mindset of having more makes it better which is obviously not the correct mindset to take in this Now that I think about the situation a little more carefully I see your point exactly David and I wholeheartedly sp Like I said I'm just assuming that more bullets and or bigger bullets is better Once again though I want to state that I am a pro gun individual and do NOT believe that gun control is really a viable option here in the United States regardless of the drivel that I spout here Jason
