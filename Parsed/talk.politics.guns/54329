From Todd Helfter Subject Re BATF FBI revenge Does anyone have any idea about the size of Waco I'm just curious because if it were a small town that may have something to do with Possibly It sure didn't take it very long to burn down I was watching ABC and it only took like a little over minutes to burn Waco is a city of about The population temporarily raised to about people when all the feds and state police officers I tell you what I stayed in a hotel room about miles from the BD compound around weeks I have never felt more paranoid in my whole There were at least state police in the The claim we had the water turned off so the fire engines had to bring their own doesn't hold up If they had cut off the water they surely could have turned it back on just as They just didn't want to There were some scores to Message to anybody else is very clear DON'T FUCK WITH WE WILL DO YOU Not that I am one to believe that everything that the government tells us is true but if that was the message they wanted to send why did they wait days I think the message would be better sent by charging in there right away not waiting for days and pounding them with sound A bunch of dead BD members are not going to be so able to tell their side of the story so now all we have is the story according to the BATF and Also Mr care about the rights of people Clinton or his administration approved this action FBI said 'Washington had approved it' They FBI said the gas masks used by the BDs have a finite life and were close to running WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE JUST WAITED Well there are people supposedly They can tell their As far as Bill Clinton is concerned don't you think he has more pressing matters to attend to besides some small group of people in Texas How about Bosnia Now there's a Why couldn't they have waited They waited too long as it Something should have been done They gov is trying to say it was a mass In the past they had expressed this was a real possibility but now they decided it wasn't a possibility so they could go on with the Apparantly what they feel Korash was or was not capable of or going to do was driven by what was most convenient at the Now this means that The public and media will forget about all this having become weary of This has already happened for many There will be no investigation independent or otherwise or a Very much a There will be no unsealing of the warrant and related What anybody will know about this incident will be the BATF With the way our government is I wouldn't doubt The BATF has just been given Carte Blanche for further abuses with the effective support and approval of the Clinton said on the news that he knew about what was happening but that it was all in the hands of the That is if you choose to believe the There WILL BE more abuses with no concern of Administration The precident has been established that the Feds can kill in quantity to achieve their Especially if the target is excercising their rights under the Second Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights and is a government declared un nice If they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why shouldn't they have done something What possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher Also is child abuse covered by the Bill of Rights LLs and CLAMs will be Dung Tsow Ping sp will be Saddam Hussein sp will be Idi Amin would be Stalin would be Even Hitler would be Any self respecting despot would nod and say Well Done Bill Clinton Well then there are probably a lot of self respecting despots in the US cause I'm sure they feel the same God Bless America Land of the Free past tense Well maybe I AM But I see on the TV as I am typing where Maybe maybe There are a lot of questions that should be raised about this The problem is who will do it and be heard govt spoksewoman the new attorney general known to be almost rabid about private ownership of guns wants to ban 'assault guns' and just about everything else is saying the FBI had amazing restraint then falls back into the official goverenment line about how the BD were guity of child abuse and were into it in an on going basis and so Note that according to the Liberal Elite giving a child a spanking is regarded as child abuse seriously if it gets known the STATE can take your child away from you if you spank your kid She also is saying Which state is that The federal government or an individual state government CLINTON PERSONALLY APPROVED THIS OPERATION she told him it was appropriate and so on and he SAID OK DO IT Somehow I am not surprised the people MUST KNOW WHO IS BOSS WHO IS IN CHARGE And it is obviouly no longer the It seems to me that the people haven't been in charge for a long If they really were I don't think the government would be doing as many things as it has in the And I maintain the appropriate response as far as this raid by BATF is concerned regarding child abuse is so what BATF are not our Child Protective Services After all the BD had been TRIED on that charge before and found NOT The gov't people have pretty much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns BD supposedly has and stress the continued child abuse apparantly to make it a seem as sort of a 'rescue' operation figuring everyone hates child abusers and anything is OK to use against them Occasional references to ammunition possesed by the BDs and so on is irrelevant it is NOT ILLEGAL to have ammunition yet True but is it illegal to have a rocket launcher Am I having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this thing Or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug and Business as Usual will continue to be the Order of the Day in the New Order Who will be given the official title of Thought Police I And if Clinton and friends have their way highly likely at this point the New Order Government will also have all the So what if is going to be ten years I think we are going to discover that we will be paying DEARLY for putting this fellow in office for decades to Even some die hard supporters are having serious doubts about their Shit if people dont get what they want right away there is an instant Clinton has only been in office for a few Give him a chance to get something The guy had a lot of shit thrown in his lap in the Give him a chance to work on things a As they say Rome wasn't built in a Yes I am I see NO GOOD as far as civil individual rights to come of any of his proposals decisions for the last month or We have really been Or Bill of Rights is now nothing but a quaint I highly doubt that it is that bad How about the Rodney King trial The two people who were most responsible got the How bad the axe falls tho is yet to be Anybody for impeachment I would prefer to give Bill a little more than four or five months to solve the nations Without prejudice UCC Pat Myrto Seattle WA If all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat WISDOM Only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the Albert Einstien Jason
