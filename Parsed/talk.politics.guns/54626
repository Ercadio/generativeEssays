From Tavares Subject Re Waco survivors April In article Mitchell S Todd writes David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out Koresh had lied and lied and lied about coming out of the To the To his To just about I keep hearing this but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except As far as I am concerned I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL Well it never was it was broadcast locally in a chopped up fashion and that's And even then they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure but not so cleverly that we didn't hear The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his We'll never know if he would have kept that The FBI can't wait forever for Koresh to come As long as they thought that Koresh's intended to surrender When they lost hope in that they decided to go Strangely enough the previous day they said they were prepared to wait as long as it Further while the Mondays tactics were silly and clumsy they were obviously intended to drive the Davidians out of the compound not to kill Koresh and his Quite But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing line between guilt and innocence only the line between murder and negligent If it is I read in the paper that the government listening devices inside the compound picked up orders to burn the joint down shortly before the fire was I'm waiting to see what the tapes really This would be an interesting The Davidian may be telling the truth or he may be lying to save his skin from possible murder charges resulting from the Koresh's lawyer being the attorney for at least one surviving Davidian has an interest in claiming that the gov't caused the fire at least as much as the gov't has an interest in blaming Koresh for the It's the physical evidence that will decide who's telling It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go state's evidence parrot the FBI story hang the whole suicide on Koresh claim they only stayed at gunpoint If any of them do this in the next few weeks it doesn't prove much but if none of them do it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is dead If you believe that I speak for my company OR write today for my special Investors'
