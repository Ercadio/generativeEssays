From mfrhein Michael Frederick Rhein Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS In article writes I will be surprised if this post makes it past the censors but here goes Monday April EDT MURDER MOST FOUL CNN is reporting as I write this that the ATF has ignited all I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have accidentaly started the the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco The lies from ATF say holes were made in the walls and 'non lethal' tear gas pumped in A few minutes after this started the whole thing went From my understanding of the CNN report it was HOURS after they ALL buildings are NO ONE HAS I think it obvious that the ATF used armored flame thrower vehicles to pump in unlit The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle the type used to tow tanks of battle fields and not an armored flame thrower napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm day in It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood stove to ignite the napalm when the stove would probably not be in And I doubt that it would have taken hours to ignite THIS IS MURDER ATF MURDERERS BUTCHERS THIS IS GENOCIDAL MASS SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN I have predicted this from the start but God it sickens me to see it I had hoped I was I had hoped that there was still some shred of the America I grew up with and loved left I was The Nazis have Right Clinton is in Sorry I couldn't resist please no flames I REPEAT AS OF THIS TIME THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS God help us PLEASE CROSSPOST DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF THE CHILDREN Gorman an American in In short Gorman I am assuming as a title because I don't think a woman would be stupid enough to make this post I don't know what episode of CNN you were watching but it obviously was not the same one that I was watching or your tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye Please excuse any mispelled words as I am a product of the Arkansas education system which Slick Willie of the Double Bubba Ticket has so greately improved during his tenour as Governer of my great state taking it from in the nation in and allowing it to drop to how I don't know and bringing it to and back to either or in sorry I can't rember the source of these numbers but they can be found Michael Rhein
