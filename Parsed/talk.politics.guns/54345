From mfrhein wpi WPI EDU Michael Frederick Rhein Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS In article AEJ D CMUVM BITNET AEJ D CMUVM BITNET writes I will be surprised if this post makes it past the censors, but here goes Monday, April, EDT MURDER MOST FOUL CNN is reporting as I write this that the ATF has ignited all I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the fire They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have accidentaly started the fire the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco, TX The lies from ATF say holes were made in the walls and 'non lethal' tear gas pumped in A few minutes after this started the whole thing went up From my understanding of the CNN report it was HOURS after they started ALL buildings are aflame NO ONE HAS ESCAPED I think it obvious that the ATF used armored flame thrower vehicles to pump in unlit The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle the type used to tow tanks of battle fields and not an armored flame thrower vehicle napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day in Texas It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood stove to ignite the napalm when the stove would probably not be in use And I doubt that it would have taken hours to ignite it THIS IS MURDER ATF MURDERERS BUTCHERS THIS IS GENOCIDAL MASS SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, INCLUDING CHILDREN I have predicted this from the start, but God, it sickens me to see it happen I had hoped I was wrong I had hoped that there was still some shred of the America I grew up with, and loved, left alive I was wrong The Nazis have won Right Clinton is in office Sorry I couldn't resist, please no flames I REPEAT, AS OF THIS TIME THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS God help us all PLEASE CROSSPOST DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF THE CHILDREN W K Gorman an American in tears In short Mr Gorman I am assuming Mr as a title because I don't think a woman would be stupid enough to make this post I don't know what episode of CNN you were watching but it obviously was not the same one that I was watching or your tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye sight Please excuse any mispelled words as I am a product of the Arkansas education system which Slick Willie of the Double Bubba Ticket has so greately improved during his tenour as Governer of my great state taking it from th in the nation in and allowing it to drop to st, how I don't know, and bringing it to st and back to either th or th in sorry I can't rember the source of these numbers but they can be found Michael F Rhein
