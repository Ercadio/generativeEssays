From Kenneth Whitehead Subject Re Your Evil Tax Dollars at Work was RE ATF BURNS RANCH ETC Mark 'Mark' Sachs MBS representing the Students for Increased Beverage Access SIBA writes Oh Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places In particular three different places where there were no APV's Well I only saw it start in one A tank punched a hole in a wall and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that a mph wind was I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday and fires started at of the holes that the tanks A terrible negligent And if the government did start the fire then why weren't people trying to get out of the compound Maybe they couldn' I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive in the upstairs of a story house on fire but it happens all the What if they were in sealed rooms trying to avoid the gas and didn't know about the fire until it surrounded them Remember the Israelis hiding in sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas bearing Scuds Cripes Mark are you REALLY a college student Maybe you ought to stop worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your Ever heard of questioning authority And oh I don't know why I'm even OK I'll buy You do seem totally I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe a murderous heavily armed religious cult despite much evidence to the They weren't They'd never harmed or even threatened anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and And as far as evidence what are you talking about Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about Maybe you and your Increased Beverage Access buddies sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda killed 'em all days ago don't feel that way but then you're probably one of those people still saying about Klinton Give the guy a chance we don't even know what he's gonna do Burp Thought Experiment Suppose this exact same thing happened under the Bush What would your answer be then Would you still prefer to believe the cultists No I don't really expect a response to that No problem you don't have any questions that scare any of Most of our minds are apparently more developed than The answer is YES In a f cking heartbeat Thought Experiment Would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth open blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president What no comeback OK go ahead say Read my lips no new taxes P But then again that is how Clinton was elected by people who believe that his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into Um isn't that how all politicians are elected Not in such a great Bush broke one promise maybe two taxes guns and we held him accountable for Of course it took him the better part of years to do it Slick's only been in office days and he's broken lots of I imagine he'll also be held accountable for I can just see the campaign buttons now ABC Anybody But Clinton So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty people Are they like just plain evil or what Did they just wake up one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the United States to figure out who to oppress that day I'm eager to Apparently you just got Nobody's claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess And as far as how they picked the Davidians who knows Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs during their religious services which was the reason the Feds gave for the timing of the raid rather than running into Maybe they KNEW that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are trying to tell the Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the Of course their reasoning doesn't matter only what they did and this time people are just paying more attention to And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader Not if you mean that stupid don't stop thinking about tomorrow How is he on diabolical laughter All I've ever heard is Hillary's diabolical Waffle Man seems to have lost his sense of Does he look good in a cape Don't know never seen him in He probably looks fat and puffy faced just like in a I saw him in the Rose Garden the other day and I couldn't get over how much he is starting to look like Teddy These things MUST be You Don't worry these things WILL be Now go back to your beer you I've heard a lot of people compare Bill Clinton to Jimmy Carter and I'd like to go on record as saying that I don't think that it's Jimmy Carter was a veteran and he had personal And even though I can't agree with Carter's policies I always believed that he was telling the truth as best he understood I can't say that for the Fat Ken Whitehead
