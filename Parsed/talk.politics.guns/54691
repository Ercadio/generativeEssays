From andy Andy Freeman Subject Re criminals machineguns In article Jason Kratz writes In CSD andy Andy Freeman writes In article Jason Kratz U writes people are getting killed by gang violence every day Every single day I hear about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapo s that are being Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M from an AR That he can see the difference between a semi auto and a full auto UZI That he can see the difference between the various versions some full auto some semi auto only of the M Well let me UZI M I see that I misphrased my I should have asked WHICH full autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi auto look I should have also included some semi auto only guns in my list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their non existent full auto relatives Let's do the former Kratz has claimed that he can visually distinguish full autos from semi For which full autos is he making that claim How does he do it Let's get specific and as exhaustive as M AR I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR If I remember correctly please correct me if I'm wrong the switch would set to an off position or an on position because the gun AR is semi Wouldn't the M have a position for semi auto fire and full auto fire or maybe round bursts Maybe Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from a two position switch via TV inspection Does he even get to see the switch in the typical police display of guns Note that one might well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection even though it won't be seen on And to think that Kratz was telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being How about the other guns Do they also have selector switch to switch between semi auto and fully auto fire Why all the questions Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction and now he's asking us how he did Well what about what I said above If that is correct I guess TV would be acceptable if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower receiver of the AR M What about it It only demonstrates that as I predicted Kratz was blowing smoke on andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private Jason Kratz didn't take andy's offer to back down in private andy wonders what Kratz is learning from this
