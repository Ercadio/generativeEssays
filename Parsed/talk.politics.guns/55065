From Dan Sorenson Subject Re The Dayton Gun Buy Back Re Boston Gun Buy Back In A Charles Scripter writes Is there something similar pro gun people can do For example, pay to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm Sounds a bit tacky, but hey, whatever works How about a gun buy back charity Get some sponsors to fund the purchase of used firearms, have a gunsmith check them over, and give or sell them at a low price to poor persons wishing to own firearms Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately The NRA is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes Mention that the NRA trains our boys in blue and you've got the media between a rock and a hard place City pays per gun to reduce crime or NRA to pay per gun to provide training guns for police and citizens Classes expanded with money saved Dan Sorenson, DoD ISU only censors what I read, not what I say Don't blame them USENET Post to exotic, distant machines Meet exciting, unusual people And flame them
