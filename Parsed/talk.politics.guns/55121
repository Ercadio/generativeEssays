From Subject BATF FBI Do Right Thing in Waco Everyone is complaining about the debacle in It is hard to understand all this What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to Why all the sour grapes BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Alas no propaganda value The FBI screwed up big time all the They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like A quick second assault before the BDs could decide on a strategy would have been the better The BDs themselves were the biggest screw ups They imagined that US law and US law enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country' WRONG They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF and if they mistook their identity initially they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they If the BDs had a problem with the warrants they take it to court just like the rest of If they wanted full auto weapons they could have obtained the proper permits just like the rest of us would need to What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does They get their chance like the rest of us at the voting If the BATF and FBI have become latter day Gestapo then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be We get to vote on laws and on the By our choices over the years we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos' the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra constitutional When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations we don't mind the heavy When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads the public doesn't Suddenly when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies we get all bent out of SUPRISE You reap what you Waco was an encapsulation of the All American experience religious fanaticism militaristic thinking and overwhelming Don't blame it on 'them' the FBI and They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the We made 'them' We ARE 'them' Jim Mason
