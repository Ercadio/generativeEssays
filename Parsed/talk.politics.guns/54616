From rjl Richard Loether Subject Re Arlen Specter's address In article Bryan Williams writes In article R In article Kenneth Whitehead writes Anybody got Arlen Spectre's address I want to write to him and thank him for showing the leadership to demand a Congressional investigation into the Waco If I had Arlen's address I would go to his house Do weasels live in houses or in holes and personally tell him what a pathetic idiot he Arlen is the personification of the word jerk I'm no fan of Arlen Spectre's but he did the right thing and attacking his motives in this case is Pardon me here but I don't trust Spectre's motives here at Spectre was a major part of the Warren Commission remember the magic bullet theory and is NOT to be trusted if there's even the tiniest chance the guv'mint may have done something If he gets a chance I'm afraid he will satisfy the public outcry with another Unfortunately if some of us get our wish and the BATF is disbanded or folded into the FBI we may end up with a more efficient agency than the bumbling and competition we have Some agents should be Some should be But keep them as bumbling as possible we retain more of our liberties that Right on the money We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set up the assault on American We must NOT count on Spectre though to get it RJL Rich Loether Snail mail University of Pittsburgh The Ideas EMail rjl Computing and Info Services Mine Voice Epsilon Drive all FAX Pittsburgh PA
