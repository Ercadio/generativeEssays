From cathy Cathy Smith Subject THE LIES OF TEXAS Neil Smith Posted for Neil Smith by Cathy Smith THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay what have we learned For reasons still being kept secret a federal agency already known well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years for a longstanding violent disregard of the law invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate violating his rights under the First Second Fourth Fifth Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the The man and his followers fight back killing four of the outlaw agency's minions wounding many more and suffering their own losses in the The agency responds by cutting off his electricity water and especially his contact with the outside They are then free to say anything at all about him in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for straightening out the mess and more importantly to script his side of the subsequent negotiations any way they The impasse lasts almost two months ironically at the same time four cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual sparking one of the ugliest riots in Armored vehicles surround the house already ringed with snipers using scoped high powered Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume and searchlights deprive those in the house of sleep in the aftermath nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic may have had on their judgment Finally another irony on the anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an At least lives including those of more than a dozen children are snuffed Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies the Attorney General and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme blame the He had illegal weapons as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being examined by the agency that created He was abusing children the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK He set the fire our snipers saw him doing Film at in He shot his followers who tried to escape or was that Jim Jones Best of all he's dead he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole A leading national paper claims of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that But when did you ever know of Americans to agree on anything doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll Very well what can we infer from the above For starters never forget that although Democratic careers are on the line and rightfully so over this fiasco by the outlaw agency's admission it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican Which may explain why Paul Harvey who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind at about the same time I did about the war in Viet Nam has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of More importantly when Rush Limbaugh who's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton it's time for fundamental changes if not in the system then at least within On March back at the beginning Mary Gingell national chair of the Libertarian Party issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its In fact the LP has promised in its platform since for at least years to abolish both agencies involved in I'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that True the LP is tiny and insignificant although less so than in ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it But alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies the LP is right about what happened in And if their advice had been followed in Waco never would have Think about And think about the fact that if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights let alone human life than in defending and expanding individual liberty maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single Think about Neil Smith Author THE PROBABILITY BROACH THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE HENRY MARTYN and forthcoming PALLAS Editor LEVER ACTION BBS FIDOnet Libertarian Second Amendment Caucus NRA Life Member My opinions are of course my
