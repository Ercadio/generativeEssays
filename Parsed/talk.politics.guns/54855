From David Garrod Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS In article Dan Hartung writes pat Pat Myrto writes If the FBI started the fire why didn t people flee the burning building Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about by the tanks pushing on the walls would shake a building pretty good perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the fire from the other side Like they were surrounded by the fire and rubble which finally combined with teargas and combustion gasses overcame and enveloped them In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames heat fumes and rubble Wait a The story being pushed here is that the fire started in ONE This is not consistent with the story that they were TRAPPED by the fire particularly in a building that all of a sudden had many more exits Choose one What What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out at least the mothers and the children so they the FBI did not bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using tear let s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the building by an upset oil What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they the FBI had killed the children by starting a fire at the other What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians made it Answer What
