From Ron Phillips Subject Waco Questions Folks It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV radio and newprint Ideally these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and hopefully wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and My list is up to that are really nagging at my The list will probably What were the contents of the original warrant now sealed that the BATF obtained It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition could not be flushed down the Therefore a no knock raid could be ruled Prior to the initial assault on the complex did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness without a contingent of assault and news media personnel attempt to knock on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law On the day of the initial assault on the complex BATF agents were aware that several small children were inside the In the ensueing gun battle BATF agents fired into a building known to contain children killing at least one two year old Knowing children were present why didn't the BATF have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over in firearms and Did David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms License were they actively participating in the legal business of selling buying firearms and ammunition and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed Does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed After the original assault on the compound tragically failed a BATF spokeswoman stated We were outgunned Yet TV newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents armed with MP and AR Although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's bodies they also may have had AK and SKS What type s of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily why did the FBI treat it as a hostage situation Along the same lines why did the FBI use psychological warfare techniques including sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their Since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out why did the FBI expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch Davidians setting fire to the Branch Davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a Video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass Yet bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building This seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through What evidence does the FBI have that a mass suicide pact existed FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition and or powder cache Yet the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source Was any evidence found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball If so and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter's car which had been left at the Is there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charges will be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act FBI Director Sessions states that during the final assault on the complex over shots were fired at the On the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles Yet there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were Also there are no indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows buildings or other structures in the Surely these should be evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored Finally the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the Do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high power rifles CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare The United States has signed international treaties which prevent the use of CS gas in If the United States could not morally use CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land On April FBI spokesmen state that at least bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed On April the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the Were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head Ron Phillips Senior Customer Engineer Intergraph Electronics East Evelyn Avenue VOICE Mountain View CA FAX
