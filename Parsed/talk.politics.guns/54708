From Dillon Pyron Subject Re S Brady bill loopholes In article shepardC p y GC , Mark Shepard writes Hi I've just finished reading S , and have several questions about the Brady bills S and HR Good Are these the current versions of the Brady bill What is the status of these bills I've heard they're in committee How close is that to being made law Not very Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate, things are backing up The House judiciary is going to start looking at our friends from the ATF, so that bill will be held up a little, too NOTE Things can change quickly S and HR seem fairly similar Are there any important differences I missed S seems to have some serious loopholes A S doesn't specify an appeals process to wrongful denial during the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit S has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established, but not before I thought there was a correction process in both bills for both parts B the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying approving using existing records so who would I sue in A above to have an inaccurate record corrected Very correct C S includes an exception to waiting period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law Enforcement Officer CLEO of an immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member But S doesn't say exactly what is considered a threat , nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception statement Welcome to the world of the privileged True Have I misunderstood Any other 'holes How about no compulsion to allow purchase if there is no evidence against With just S , what's to stop a person with a clean record from buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this It is already illegal to do this 'Seems at min a gun counting scheme would be needed e g , John Doe owns N guns So, if S passes, I wouldn't be surprised to see legislation for stricter, harder to forge I D 's plus national gun registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work This is the health card Or so some paranoids claim I say that just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you Please comment I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any all waiting period bills ever proposed Dillon Pyron The opinions expressed are those of the TI DSEG Lewisville VAX Support sender unless otherwise stated when I'm here when I'm home Texans Vote NO on Robin Hood We need solutions, not gestures PADI DM
