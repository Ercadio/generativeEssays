From Dillon Pyron Subject Re Brady bill loopholes In article Mark Shepard writes I've just finished reading and have several questions about the Brady bills and Good Are these the current versions of the Brady bill What is the status of these bills I've heard they're in committee How close is that to being made law Not Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate things are backing The House judiciary is going to start looking at our friends from the ATF so that bill will be held up a little NOTE Things can change and seem fairly Are there any important differences I missed seems to have some serious loopholes doesn't specify an appeals process to wrongful denial during the waiting period other than a civil lawsuit has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established but not before I thought there was a correction process in both bills for both the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying approving using existing records so who would I sue in A above to have an inaccurate record corrected Very includes an exception to waiting period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law Enforcement Officer CLEO of an immediate threat to his or her life or life of a household But doesn't say exactly what is considered a threat nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception Welcome to the world of the privileged True Have I misunderstood Any other 'holes How about no compulsion to allow purchase if there is no evidence against With just what's to stop a person with a clean record from buying guns grinding off the serial numbers and selling them to crooks At minimum what additional laws are needed to prevent this It is already illegal to do 'Seems at a gun counting scheme would be needed John Doe owns N guns So if passes I wouldn't be surprised to see legislation for stricter harder to forge 's plus national gun registration justified by a need to make the Brady bill This is the health Or so some paranoids I say that just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get Please I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any all waiting period bills ever Dillon Pyron The opinions expressed are those of the TI DSEG Lewisville VAX Support sender unless otherwise when I'm here when I'm home Texans Vote NO on Robin We need solutions not PADI DM
