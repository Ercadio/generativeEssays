From Daniel Oldham Subject Blast them next time What happened in Waco is not the fault of the If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of The BATF needs more people better weapons and more armored When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand If you are going to do a job then do it The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this Look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death days
