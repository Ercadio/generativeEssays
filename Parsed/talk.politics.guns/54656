From Jim De Arras Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS In article C tEnu F ns nodak edu green plains NoDak edu Bill Green writes Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported AP, etc that there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc as the cause Widely reported , eh Remember, this has had a news blackout since day The FBI is the single, sole, source of these rumors It may be the truth, but it may not be We may never know We MUST question it, though Why no media coverare What were they hiding What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb th raid It would seem so Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome They would still be alive, today Another day is another chance Were FBI actions blaring loudspeakers, etc the right course of action I think it contributed to the outcome Folks that are sleep deprived tend not to think clearly And a few other questions Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in general, were proper But I still have some reservations I feel strongly they were NOT proper One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the balls to go ahead and take full responsibility Seems like the waffle boy had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue As expected If it had come out well, he would not have hesitated to take full credit Jim I'm always rethinking that There's never been a day when I haven't rethought that But I can't do that by myself Bill Clinton April If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms, never never never WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM Nov
