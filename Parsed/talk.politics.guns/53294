From Steve Manes Subject Re Gun Control was Re We're Mad as Hell at the TV News Jim De Arras wrote Last year the US suffered almost wrongful or accidental deaths by handguns alone FBI statistics In the same year the UK suffered such deaths Scotland Yard statistics The population of the UK is about that of the US Weighted for population the US has as many handgun related deaths as the And no the Brits don't make up for this by murdering as many people with baseball You just can't compare this way All homicides must be shown per capita not just The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in as the As a favorite As lethal not A study of violence in Chicago produced this table Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks Resulting in Death Weapon Deaths As Percentage of Attacks Knives total attacks Guns total attacks Source Firearms and Violence in American Life It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with If this were so knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used like Vancouver would show a higher fatality But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun In fact the reverse was What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stabs wounds wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest Most gun homicides did not show this Rather more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the Source Report on Firearms and Violence Then since England USA my ancestors left because of the oppression you must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to be able to draw any meaning at England has essentially legalized drugs so there are no drug gangs battling for turf If you drop out the drug related killings here the USA would look a whole lot more There are a lot of factors which make a Actually I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and There are more cultural beahvioral and economic differences between us than I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US whether we banned guns or required every law abiding citizen to carry a loaded On the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar namely the In fact an exhaustive seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver British Columbia and Seattle cities with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun In Seattle handguns may be purchased legally for self After a day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed The recreational use of handguns is minimally In Vancouver self defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a Concealed weapons are not Recreational uses of handguns target shooting collecting are regulated by the Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted weapons A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked In short gun control but not unreasonably Both cities aggressively enforce their gun Convictions for gun related offenses carry similar The researchers studied all cases of robbery assault simple and aggravated burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from to In defining the cases they used the same standard the FBI's Unified Crime Results during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates assaults were recorded in Seattle versus in The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher However when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons firearms were far more likely to be used in In fact times as Over the seven year study homicides occurred in Seattle per homicides in Vancouver per After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle as compared to Vancouver was found to be When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons excluding firearms in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by Handguns accounted for roughly of homicides involving Handguns were times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in The authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides self defense Only such homicides occurred during the seven year study of which were committed by Only cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred in Seattle and in Only involved After excluding these cases there was virtually no impact on these earlier This is I feel a very fair One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of NYC Chicago Los Angeles and Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other This report shows If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in However during the study interval Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle suggesting that few would be assailants switched to homicide by other As well ready access to handguns for self defense by law abiding citizens was not endorsed in this Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense these cases accounted for less than of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study And as was reported Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self Heavily quoted source Handgun Regulation Crime Assaults and Homicide A Tale of Two John Sloan Arthur Kellerman Donald Reay James Ferris Thomas Koepsall Frederick Rivara Charles
