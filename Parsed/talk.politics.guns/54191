From VEAL David Veal Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In article CMM Thomas Parsli writes Abuse by the goverment This seems to be one of the main problems Any harder gun control would just be abused by the Either some of you are a little paranoid no Parsli I have to take exception at There are verifiable previous examples of levels of governments abusing gun control I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the OR you should get a new You do have elections I'd love But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents there's not a lot I can It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change Down that road lies total government I've never been a fan of Guns 'n Criminals MOST weapons used by criminals today are This is very Known criminals can NOT buy weapons that's one of the points of gun And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled The North American Continent is not Europe no matter how many people would like it to Drugs are very illegal and they're For years Canada has crowed about its gun If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the yet they still don' Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled then I really can't accept that Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS No there are approximately deaths due to guns in the two thirds of which are Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for However this makes the per gun death rate about half the per car death The issue I I think we all agree that the criminals are the main Guns are not a problem but the way they are used and what are they for I think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex Jugoslavia They should all have weapons it's their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other Innocent people the problem is humans not The problem's been humans since before we had stone The fct of the matter is simply this If nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally Yet weapons are built I'd suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre dates Anyway the Bosnians et have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand Taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the If of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it's the 'axer' An example don't flame me just because not exactly are killed by In the approximately of murders are commited with with handguns with non The reason I say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries entire violent crime I don't really think we've got more knives or In any case I think examples of gun control applied to the have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of Until you deal with why people are doing what they are doing you won't solve your And if the problem is violent crime you shouldn't concentrate on the tools The vast majority of guns is never ever On the order of over the entire lifetime of the gun This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect Is this a good situation The situation is not good in that people fear for their But recall the scenes of the store owners during the last riots protecting their shops with Would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles no it isn' However if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in You have to examine which problem you're referring If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above mentioned store If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen I mean if everybody had a gun in USA of Households have some form of firearm usually a long That accounts for a level of access for at least million Firearm ownership is most likely among educated well off whites the group least likely to be involved in violent You may take that for what it's David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your
