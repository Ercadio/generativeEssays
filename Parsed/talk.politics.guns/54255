From andy Andy Freeman Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card In Jason Kratz U writes What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city gang Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming The majority that I see are still carrying So Look in the trunk some Heck look at the That funny thing attached with a quick release is a The ones in the trunk are better I don't have numbers for Chicago but Philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and thousands of rounds as standard issue in the Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I mean semi auto handguns you're going to be at a disadvantage even with What is the nature of this disadvantage If the cop can shoot rounds will do the job against a single opponent especially since the cop has guaranteed backup If the gang member can shoot the extra rounds don't The only time this difference can matter is if neither can shoot and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around like BTW most cops carry multiple You're not supposed to know about the second third and so I have been at a shooting range where gang members were practicing How do we know that they were gang members and not undercover cops or even law abiding menacing BTW Why the sneer quotes They were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren't doing too badly Then the extra rounds won't make any difference so why is it an issue andy
