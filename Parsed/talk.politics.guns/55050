From Dan Sorenson Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas Foxvog Douglas writes Dan Sorenson writes That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining these weapons This means you would support a ban if it were narrow Very Very very If you'll recall I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn't is only the start of and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of modern practice five months or five centuries down the I would hope Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon whose majority of energy comes from fission and or fusion of atomic And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being Reactors blow with a steam explosion but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the See what a can of worms this is Last I heard Calhoun station just north of Omaha Nebraska wasn't considered a Given the sodium cooled breeder designs on the blocks now I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty With the PRISM design there is no operator input needed on the reactor itself and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the So your definition is flawed in a few respects Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause death or serious disease further defined to a significant number of people if released in a city similarly populated area resevoir or Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she If you don't mind extrapolation any HIV positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the Finally that manure pile I mention below fits this definition as does say releasing a pet rattlesnake to the Nerve gas and mustard gas are well Other poisonous gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there is no use not related to Licenses should be available for research purposes on such And I can show where any such gas has other For example perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne It can be used for welding in miners lamps for gassing gophers or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon just like any other flammable So now my miners lamps won't work I can't do any welding and I still have those pesky I am not a lawyer but these ideas could certainly be a basis for The basis for but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any I'll give you a little hint see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the road In the USA that is a weapon of mass destruction It is not considered a It is under your proposed So is a silage pit if there is run So are underground fuel biological in nature because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking So where do you draw the line In the USA the EPA has ruled that a pile of scrap iron is Care to draw a thinner line this time It is not defined as a weapon of mass Many things are banned for other It meets all the criterion of a It is an instrument that can be used for fighting even though that is not its intended purpose and despite there being better weapons Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water mass destruction is rather a It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or The looser your definition the more ripe for abuse that law Furthermore if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the Again ripe for Dan Sorenson DoD ISU only censors what I read not what I Don't blame USENET Post to exotic distant Meet exciting unusual And flame
