From pat Pat Myrto Subject WACO Willie Authorizes Cook Out was Re FBI Director's Statement NOTE local tx groups trimmed out of Newsgroups line In article Donald Nash writes In article Tavares writes No you were right the first Law enforcement agencies should keep HIS opinions in mind before breaking into or assaulting ANYBODY'S OK let me correct my unfortunate choice of words I just hope that the law enforcement agencies keep your attitude in mind the next time your wife is gang raped by a bunch of juvenile drug dealing thugs while she was jogging in the No strike The BATF came out with horse trailers men ninja uniforms machine guns and stun grenades and used them before Koresh could even look at the Koresh fought back and people The key part of this sentense is Koresh fought This was his big When the police decide to exert their authority over you you don't fight back unless you want people to get You cease all resistance and signal your submission to their The cops They are the You are the The concept of defense against illegal action under color of law is No longer is it government of the people by the people its government of the people by the biggest The idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine but one has to GET TO COURT IN ONE PIECE to do Korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that see below aren't in it to beat up and kill people in spite of the actions of a few bad If you quit resisting they quit Perhaps the BATF did over react to the threat posed by Perhaps they did use too much OK I'm willing to concede to that point if sufficient proof is produced and I admit that there is some evidence to indicate this However resisting the BATF is the worst thing Koresh could have If they hadn't resisted there is a good chance that no one would have been Remeber they were using stun grenades not anti personnel If the BDs were not in violation of any Rember Korash didn't get to sort this all out serenely typing at his He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off he saw he was being ATTACKED with no overt action from him yet He could no more say 'oh its ok its only stun grenades' anymore than I He slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the He felt in genuine fear of his life I know I would be in fear of MY life at that Have you ever been shot at How clear and logically could you think under that pressure when you MIGHT have ALL OF or SECONDS to evaluate what is going on And it would not be the first time that 'law enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect For all we know he was informed by someone saying something like Hey guy the BATF is coming like gangbusters and they mean to WASTE According to the latest news the released warrant so we are told said the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around on firearms and related stuff over an undetermined period Now even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure for people that isn't really all that much you priced decent guns lately Hell I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL mostly machineguns Sure he is an avid collector but unless a new law has been passed it is NOT illegal nor an indication of anything illegal to have a lot of Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE So what is the justification of this cowboy raid other than a romp gone bad for some anti gun media hype to support Clinton's push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons This administration has only one thing in PEOPLE Whether it is gun control Clinton Cripple Chip National smart ID cards it all boils down to PEOPLE Can you say only years late I knew you laws they would have been released as they had been If this had happened and it turned out that the BATF had used too much force then the BDs would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges of civil rights violations Sounds a lot like LA huh Don't take that wrong I'm not commenting one way or the other about the Rodney King case But that's not what they They got tipped off that the BATF was on the way in and rather than adopting a non violent non threatening posture to greet the BATF they decided to And BATF knew the BDs were expecting them via minutes report But they decided they were so big so bad they would have a cakewalk at the BDs expense for a nice media show But it all turned to shit and the FBI taking over to manage things we see it all turned to shit Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility' Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes Bet you NOBODY pays any serious 'Responsibility' only has meaning as media PR or as a means to corner the average Joe Figure it Clinton Reno the FBI and BATF will all be Can you say WHITEWASH I've said enough of this I'm probably not going to convince any of you folks and you're certainly not going to convince I've got work to Don Be VERY afraid of our In the land of the And if you decide all this is acceptable get even MORE especially when it is YOU they decide for some reason they When they no longer feel the need to confine their cowboy tactics to 'kooks' or 'wierdos' Without prejudice UCC Pat Myrto Seattle WA If all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat WISDOM Only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure
