Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card From Jason 'Think ' Steiner Jason Kratz U writes PA David Veal says Jason Kratz U writes Don't be Of course you The police have everything the gangs have and then Plus they've got access to the National Guard via the Governor if things get too That's tanks for those of you who've never seen them at Of course they've got rifles and And as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city gang Of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to Every day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming The majority that I see are still carrying Not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I mean semi auto handguns you're going to be at a disadvantage even with how so i think you're making assumptions here that might not necessarily be my personal choice would be a semi auto but revolvers are just as effective if not more I have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing They were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren't doing too badly relevancy please you sound shocked but that hardly proves The University cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the Chicago It seems most state cops I don't know where you are originally from David but you live in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news and in the I think the situation is just a tad different here than wait doesn't Chicago have serious gun control if so why do the police need all that firepower in the first place sarcasm alert all the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to the dash IMHO that's all the police need to outgun just about jason The Crystal Wind is the Storm and the Storm is Data and the Data is Life The Player's Litany from The Long Run by Moran
