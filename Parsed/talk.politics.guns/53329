From KENNEDY JAMES SCOT Subject Re A universal RIGHT to bear arms NOT Nathan F Janette writes In article A KENNEDY JAMES SCOT writes Gary Coffman writes In article A writes In article C sK w L Stephen D Grant writes Nathan F Janette writes I suppose that's true if you maintain that AK s and AR s are hunting weapons I think they are fun to plink cans targets random VC with, but not suitable for real hunting Wrong Both are legal to hunt with here in Kentucky I have a picture of a friend with a nice point buck which he shot with his AR rifle I don't think many deer hunters would condone your friends choice of rifle I must agree with Nathan As a deer hunter, I find it inhumane to use underpowered weapons for deer hunting To kill cleanly with the little requires extremely good marksmanship Most hunting situations don't allow for perfect shots Hunters should use sufficiently powerful weapons to drop the deer with a single hit to the chest The x from the AKS or SKS is adequate to this task, having similar ballistics to the familiar , but the little is very marginal In the hands of the expert, or the lucky, it will do, but hunters really should have more respect for their quarry Gary I'll agree that the popular gr loading for rem is too small for deer sized game However, if you use a gr semi spritzer or the Sierra gr semi pointed bullet this would be suitable like any round, you keep your shots within a reasonable range It would still be on the lower end of what I'd consider acceptable performance, especially those long distance shots out West hunting Monster Mule Deer The rem has been declared legal for deer hunting in Oklahoma The is excellent for varmit hunting and pest control The AR in particular is well suited, given its heavy barrel and heat shielded foregrip Add a high power scope, and you're in Dog heaven However, I don't think Nathan Janette was refering to the specific chambering of the rifle in question Maybe he thinks self loading rifles have no place in deer hunting That may or may not be his opinion, but many sportsmen do use self loading rifles and shotguns Wrongo, NRA man I was definitely referring to the round, not the auto loading aspect of the rifle I have no problem with responsible hunting That doesn't include machine guns from choppers, but a semi is fine My uncle has bagged several deer with gauge slugs I would prefer that a hunter use as much of the catch as possible, and I don't condone hunting for sport only IMHO, of course Two questions You asserted that both the AR and AK are not suitable for real hunting If you have no problem with hunting, or using self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this If not for deer, then what about other, smaller game When did I get the nickname NRA man Notice I have never referred to you as Janette which you don't seem to like Do I get any super powers, like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man Scott Kennedy Brewer, Patriot, and now NRA Man, defender of Truth, Justice, and the nd Amendment
