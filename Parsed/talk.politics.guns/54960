From Scott W Roby Subject Photographers removed from compound Relay of coverage seen There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier today Wednesday It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without It was explained to the press that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' It was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention It will probably be mentioned in the papers My opinions I find this While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last days of patient opportunity I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to It will be interesting to see the hearings on this I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous Please also note that I by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy type theories I have read here and in other As usual I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility As such my opinion is subject to change as more information is made Scott Roby Standard Disclaimer
