From Scott W Roby Subject Re BATF FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today In article Strider writes Scott W Roby writes Strider writes According to an Australian documentary made in the year before the stand off began Koresh and his followers all believed he was Koresh had sex with children and women married to other men in the These were the perfect children resulting from the great seed of his magnified horn Ex members describe him in ways not dissimilar to the way Jim Jones has been I don't know how accurate the documentary was The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex The documentary disucussed Koresh's Christ status inside the cult cult brain washing techniques and unusual sex practices the leader gets any he wants and tells others when they can or can't I will let others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is technically child abuse or however Koresh was never convicted of any crimes against children nor was the BATF after him for child Their purview in this case is strictly in firearms violations All so this information is irrelevant to the Well if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult then the history and background of the cult is very The history and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding what happened at Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in this badly handled FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background Plus those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their decisions in great detail to Why would the FBI want to fulfill Koresh's own prophecy Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain something but whether their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never And who is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled It only holds meaning for the nine who It is likely that there will be at least two investigations JD and congress at this Correction The FBI said that two of the cult members said this so far no one else has been able to talk to So when they talk to the news reporters directly and relate the same details will you believe them IF they confirm the story I probably Definitely not until then Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come I have reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional or accidental and how it started and why it spread so Mike Ruff
