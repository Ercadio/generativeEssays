From Richard Cower Subject Waco dates are these coincidental The ATF agent interviewed on Street Stories reported that the raid was ill planned and went ahead even when they the BD's knew the ATF was WHY I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had days to plan it and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President I would even suggest that the loss of ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents Street Stories report requests for sufficient fire Important dates Feb NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon Feb Compound in Waco On the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that It looked like it might be a tight vote but the Senate in was going to vote to overturn the It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban given Clintons stated agenda on gun I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present they were initially at the incident in Waco to record the event for the TV The agent on Street Stories reported that a supervisor was urging them all to get ready fast as they know we are coming I believe this attack continued even tho the probablility of failure was high because it came from the top After the assembly vote the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill
