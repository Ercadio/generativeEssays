From Steve Hendricks Subject Re Limiting Govt Was Re Employment was Re Why not In article writes In article Steve Hendricks writes don't specify the means through which the government is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business As a left wing big government conventional liberal I'm just as willing as you are to vote against anti competitive regulations that favor auto But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws and a desire to eliminate legislator's Each strikes me as a particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special interests cannot influence public In fact they seem clearly designed to accomplish the government is not allowed to use non initiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest can influence the government to use non initiated force on their Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and For example does non initiated force coercion include tax collection Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state how is the state to deal with it Exclusively through after the fact arbitration legal compulsion The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy Statists run the education monopoly so we have to be The Advocates for Self Government reports of their Seminar participants embrace That's the best means I've seen We should lobby for compulsory Seminar in jest Well I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a complex conflictual industrial I'd venture to point out however that if libertarians couldn't convince at least of a group of seminar participants to embrace their philosophy their propaganda skills need to be Frankly however it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which almost everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government Once that is assumed all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with elections police And as Marx said the state will just wither On the way there however would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives Or is it like socialism just some short term pain that we'll have to bear until everyone has had the benefit of re education through regular seminar training jsh Roger Collins Steve Hendricks DOMAIN steveh One thing about data it sure does cut UUCP uunet isc br thor steveh the bulls Hofferbert Ma Bell
