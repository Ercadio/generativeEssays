From Clinton HQ The White House Subject CLINTON President's Press Conference THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT The East Room EDT THE PRESIDENT Terry do you have a question Q President there's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something anything to stop the Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites THE PRESIDENT Well first let me say as you know for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further And I want to say too let's look at the last three Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward first on the no fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrops on the war crimes investigation on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace We have made some And now we have a very much tougher sanctions And Leon Fuerth who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President is in Europe now working on implementing That is going to make a big difference to And we are reviewing other I think we should We should lead the United States should We have led for the last three We have moved the And to be fair our allies in Europe have been willing to do their And they have troops on the ground But I do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do I think we will have And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the administration as it should have over the last days or I think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate Q Can I follow up THE PRESIDENT Q Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust THE PRESIDENT I think the Holocaust is on a whole different I think it is without precedent or peer in human On the other hand ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long And I think you have to stand up against I think it's We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning and I think we're making progress on that But what's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the Q President by any count you have not had a good week in your The tragedy in Waco the defeat of your stimulus bill the standoff in What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently How do you look at things Are you reassessing THE PRESIDENT I don't really believe that the situation in Bosnia it's not been a good week for the world but I don't know that the administration could have made it On the stimulus package I'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American We have abandoned trickle down We've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from trillion to trillion in only a The budget plan which passed the Congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a year low in mortgage rates dramatically lower interest There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very very good for the And so we are moving in the right direction I regret that the stimulus did not pass and I have begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the administration but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics part of it was a difference in There are really people still who believe that it's not I just disagree with I think the recovery the economists say it's been underway for about two years and we've still had months of seven percent unemployment and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating So I think there was an idea base an argument there that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go Now I have to tell you I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in and voted times for regular supplemental appropriations like I just misgauged And I hope that I can learn I've just been here And you know I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for years and it took me a decade to get political reform So it takes time to change But I basically feel very good about what's happened in the first days with regard to the Q Waco THE PRESIDENT Well with regard to Waco I don't have much to add to what I've already I think it is a I want the situation looked I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone But I still maintain what I said from the beginning that the offender there was David And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill And I'm sorry that they killed their Q President to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill Ross Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people in your tax He was strongly critical of your stimulus He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade How are you going to handle his political criticism Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill THE PRESIDENT Let me answer that question We're going to revisit all of that over the next few I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about With regard to the economic plan I must say I found that rather I don't want to get into an argument with I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are but I would go back and read his book and his There's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the But otherwise the plans are remarkably So I think it would be I'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to I'll be glad to hear Q To follow up sir how do you plan to handle his political criticism He's launched a campaign against Do you think you can sit back and just THE PRESIDENT Well first of all I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to And if he's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what his ideas Maybe he's got some constructive I think the American people have shown that they're very impatient with people who don't want to produce And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last even if they don't agree with what I do is that I want to get something I just came here to try to change I want to do And I want to do things that help people's So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good that is constructive that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will change people's lives for the better But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the Q President to go back to Bosnia for a You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of The United States is the last remaining Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally THE PRESIDENT Well the United States surely you would agree that the United States even as the last remaining superpower has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Q But you have a mandate and THE PRESIDENT They do and that is one of the things that we have under I haven't ruled out any option for I would remind all of you I have not ruled out any option except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities We are So we are reviewing other But I also would remind you that to be fair our allies have had the French the British and the Canadians have had troops on the ground They have been justifiably worried about But they have supported the airdrops the toughening of the They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have I don't have any criticism of the British the French and others about Q Would that be military action Q President several of the leading lights in your administration ranging from your FBI Director to your Ambassador to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in your Why is that Are you losing your political grip THE PRESIDENT Give me an Q Example Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's newspapers at least that she favors air strikes in All of these are things you said that you didn't THE PRESIDENT First of all I don't know what we know that David Koresh had sex with I think that is undisputed is it not Is it not Does anybody dispute that Where I come from that qualifies as child And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill I think that qualifies as And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I don't know exactly what he In terms of Madeleine Albright Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her or memo in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do And I'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do then I will announce what I'm going to So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of Q How about the Value Added Tax President THE PRESIDENT What was that Q The Value Added Tax Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good THE PRESIDENT I don't mind them saying they think it's a good There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care No decision has been made on And I have no objection to their expressing their views on We've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global I took no that wasn't taking a line against an administration Q President a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would fulfill those Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations THE PRESIDENT Well I don't know about And I don't know what their it depends on what the expectations But I'll tell you this I believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of I believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for I believe we need the services of all of our people and I have said that And not as a political The first time this issue came up was in when I was in I was just asked the question about And I might add it's interesting that I have been attacked obviously those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in When I was Governor I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities and I'm going to stick right with Q Are you concerned sir that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue THE PRESIDENT Yes but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the I've just simply taken my position and tried to see it And that's what I It doesn't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do and that's what I'll continue to Q President getting back to the situation in Bosnia and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes perhaps to cut off supply Without telling us your decision presumably you haven't made any final decisions on those two options what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision THE PRESIDENT I'm reluctant to get into There are those are two of the There are some other options that have been All have pluses and minuses all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress where I would remind you heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new I do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action apply If you take action if the United States takes action we must have a clearly defined objective that can be We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be The United States is not should not become involved as a partisan in a With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace Will it lead to more bloodshed What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options we Q Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent How can we afford to go to any more of these wars THE PRESIDENT Well I think that's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war But we are after all the world's only super We do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences and goodness knows there have been many but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions Q Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday And in general how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia THE PRESIDENT No I have not made any agreement and he did not ask for We never even discussed that interestingly The Russians I would remind you in the middle of President Yeltsin's campaign abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and I'm sure the rest of the free world very much Q Do you wish President that you'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation And how would you handle that situation differently now THE PRESIDENT I don't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that One of the things that I'm sure will come out when we look into this is the questions will be asked and answered did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten And I look forward to But at the time I have to say as I did before the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed once we knew that the FBI was going to go in was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi as least military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use And then on the day before the action I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously and which at the time I thought were I have as I said I'm sure I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have Q President what is your assessment of Director Sessions' role in the Waco affair And have you made a decision on his future And if you haven't will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide THE PRESIDENT Well first of all I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with And I mean no negative or positive I have no assessment I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the And I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the Q President since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree why do you then tell us that the United States cannot take a partisan view in this war THE PRESIDENT Well I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia or that that would ultimately be I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our allies And if it were easy I suppose it would have been solved We have tried to do more in the last days than was previously It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression and we are now looking at what else we can Q Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider THE PRESIDENT There may I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat We were then at war with Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so series of incidents so But we have as I say we've got all of our options under Q The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of What can you do to salvage it short of a full scale military operation THE PRESIDENT Well you may know something I don' That's not what our people tell I think Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government It's obvious what their concerns They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place and President Aristide we feel should be restored to We're working toward I get a report on that we discuss it at least three times a week and I'm convinced that we're going to prevail there and be I do believe that there's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized But I believe we're going to prevail Q President would you care to make your assessment of the first days before we make one for you THE PRESIDENT Well I'll say if I believe first of all we passed the budget resolution in record That was the biggest That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society reversing a year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up while the deficit went from trillion to trillion the total national debt and the deficit continued to go We have a year low in interest rates from We have lower interest rates across the We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their We have established a new environmental policy which is dramatically The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobbying And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the campaign but with turning the country The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this We are working on a whole range of other The welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to And of course a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of So I think it is amazing how much has been More will be We also passed the Family Leave A version of the motor voter bill that has not come out of conference back to me And everything has been passed except the stimulus So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right I feel good about Q Sir a follow Wouldn't you say though that one of your biggest initiatives aid to Soviet Russia is now practically finished if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own country how can we do it for them THE PRESIDENT Let me recast the question a little It's a good question laughter it's a good question but to be fair we've got to recast We have already the first round of aid to the Soviet to non Soviet Russia to a democratic Russia is plainly going to go through the first The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G to provide through the international financial institutions which is a big dollar item is plainly going to go The question is can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress And that is a question I think Mary that will be resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their I think the two things will be tied by many members of Q The tailhook report came out this morning documenting horrendous and nearly criminal conduct on the part of the How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy THE PRESIDENT First let me comment a little on The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve It is very specific in its allegations and it will be The only thing I said to the Secretary Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him I think is that I expected him to take the report and to do his And I believe he will do Q President to back to Russia for just a The latest poll show that Yeltsin will probably win his vote of But there seems to be a real toss up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic THE PRESIDENT I understand Q Can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decision though or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid THE PRESIDENT I believe the answer to your question is for the United States the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy which is who wins the If he wins the election if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President then I think we should do our best to work with him toward You know we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication their leaders were Leaders from Eastern Europe leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there's economic slowdown And in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn You can understand But if they have confidence in the leadership I think that's all we can And the United States will if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with I think he is a genuine democrat small d and genuinely committed to I think that we should support Q President Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished THE PRESIDENT I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near You know our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side We're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement The Mexicans say and there is some merit to their position that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral Even in the United States to be fair we have some folks who are worried about that about giving that On the other hand if we're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating So what we're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations if you keep on violating it past a certain point maybe not an isolated incident but a pattern of violation there is going to be some There must be And we're working out the details of But I still feel quite good about And this is just an area where I disagree with Perot and with I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America and gives us a bigger world in which to I think that's the only way a rich country can grow If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own So this is an idea You know you've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics you know who's for this and who's for that and if this person is for this somebody else has got to be for A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas over who's right and wrong about the world toward which we're And the answers are not self And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate So I just have a difference of I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound even though as you know I thought that the details needed to be Q President there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic he believes that it was Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue And more broadly do you believe that in fact the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord THE PRESIDENT First let me say I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this As to whether the document had any basis in fact let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents I do not know whether that is right or We are having it basically evaluated at this time and when we complete the evaluation we'll tell And of course we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were I think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to There are still some cases that we don't know the answer But I do believe we're making some I was encouraged by the last Q I'd like to follow up on Before the normalizes relations allows trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith THE PRESIDENT A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case every one that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved going back to the Second World But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time and that there was a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those And we're not there Again I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this I just am very influenced by how the families Q your economic stimulus package are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans your legislative plans for the coming year including the crime bill the health care initiative and other things Are there any plans to do that And also did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole THE PRESIDENT No what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self evident case particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over billion in deficit When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture and I underestimated I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with I also thought that if I made a good faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be Instead every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader So it was a strange set of But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately President I'd like to be for this but I can't And we're all strung out and we're And I think we need to do a reality As I said what I want to know let me go back to what I said what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on and Republicans or Democrats is what could I have done differently to make it come out Because the real losers here were not the President and the The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs We could have put another kids to work this I mean we could have done a lot of good things with that And I think that is very very And it became more political than it should But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water that it was deficit That just won't Q and redo THE PRESIDENT I mean you know for example you mentioned the crime I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime I mean the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last And they were all fighting over the Brady Surely surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months with the kind of mindless violence we have seen we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the That's another thing that I really believe that once we move some of that money not all but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who'd been laid off that would be a compelling I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime Q President back to the tailhook report for a That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's senior leadership in general but did not name any of the senior Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers THE PRESIDENT You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this I am in the chain of There is now an Inspector General's report and the law must take its If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this I don't really think I think all I can tell you is what I have already I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report and I want appropriate action to be Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken I have been advised that because I am the Commander in Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough Q President could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia You said that you were not considering introduction of American Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces sir THE PRESIDENT I said ground Q You said ground Could I ask you sir if you fear that using air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there THE PRESIDENT I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options I've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict Q With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities THE PRESIDENT Q Why not THE PRESIDENT Because I and basically I wouldn't participate in other I think once you become President on balance except under unusual circumstances that is not what should be But more importantly I'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that and just And that's always been my position not only for the gays who will be here but for others as Thank you very EDT
