From Marc Mueller Subject Re ABOLISH SELECTIVE SERVICE In article A fpa Trumpet CC MsState Edu Fletcher P Adams writes Kenneth C Mitchell writes Dave Borden wrote The Selective Service Registration should be abolished To start with, the draft is immoral Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now, and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior with a volunteer army than with draftees Finally, the government has us on many lists in many computers the IRS, Social Security Admistration and Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this He seems to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first, so why not this one as well Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it he admits it the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would be inclined to risk any extra exposure on Let me say this about that, as a retired Navy officer I agree Cut it But let's not stop there Eliminate the C transport Wrong We need its capability Sure it has its problems, very few airplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the answer What do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane from scatch It'll have its problems as well and there will be calls again, for it to be scrapped THe other option is to try to extend the life of the C s and C s that are getting extremely old If you read Aviation Week, the C line can be reopened and the C s would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the program Politically, though, the C is popular pork Scrap the Seawolf SSN nuclear submarine Ground the B stealth bomber It'll cost jobs, but I'm for it We especially don't need a B THe SSN , I know litttle about Agreed Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to Navy Times and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not In addition, more bases need to be closed Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being required to home port a total fleet of ships The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress Marc Mueller
