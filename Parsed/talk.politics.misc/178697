From Robert Lewis Glendenning Subject Re Welcome to Police State USA In article writes The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the Branch Davidians in an unprovoked Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare a private state has drifted into There are laws to control the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that they were being They set out to obtain a legal warrant and attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang the The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked assault assumes that the BATF were on a death Had they expected the B D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day So you approve of the BATF launching a person raid complete with flack jackets men hidden in horse trailers stun grenades semi auto weapons on peaceful citizens who would also accept a search authoried by a court There is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal Nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF unless they were thought to have a still or be smoking untaxed The automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter You don't serve no knock warrants on someone with CAL It isn't necessary they can't flush a machine gun down a toilet you know and it isn't smart if you are right you got a good chance of getting blown if you are wrong you shouldn't have done The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by ludicrously underarmed and unprotected The stupidity was indeed related to But the stupidity may have been to attempt to serve the warrant by ludicrously over armed over protected and over confident Escalation isn't automatically IT WAS A TAX MATTER YOU CAN T FLUSH MGs DOWN THE TOILET YOU DON T NEED NO KNOCK WARRANTS FOR Actually IMHO nothing justifies them but that is another argument If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could hear There wasn't any murder of police There was probable cause to arrest them for murder We US citizens are innocent until proven There also wasn't any killing until the BATF screwed up real Phill Hallam Baker Lew Lew Glendenning Perspective is worth IQ Niels Bohr or somebody like that
