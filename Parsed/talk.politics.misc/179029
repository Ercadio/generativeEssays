From Chris Struble Subject Re Waco is Gov't fault Was Re Libertarian Party on CIA FBI ATF In article In article writes Here are several shreds of evidence that prove the Waco disaster is the government's fault They raided an American's property because of rumors about Koresh's intentions with some converted yet still amendment protected firearms a judge approved warrant justifies nothing In a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a The US constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to mount a search for illegally held A search for illegally held weapons IF there were any no evidence yet produced to this effect does not justify firing into a house with women and children It also does not justify shooting first without identifying oneself the ATF and FBI have done this before so don't say they haven't please or producing a Guess it depends on whose story one believes huh It took them days to think of a basic terrorist tactic tear gas and this could only be justified in support of rescuing any supposed hostages' inside The Govt has a right to use lethal force in certain Attempts to capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others Which others are we talking about here is In this case they used sub lethal Sub lethal Excuse me but those people are dead The gov't immediately imprisoned these so called hostages' The children were held Evidence So far the FBI has produced Don't hold your The adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to Only a few of those being held in chains and s hackles are wanted The rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses It took hundreds of gov't agents with tax funded cellular phones ten minutes to dial for the fire department They should not have called the fire dept at There was no role for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might well shoot at It was not the Feds decision to make but the Calling the fire dept meant that WACO was deprived of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation where it could have been used This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY Since fire departments do answer calls that deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for not calling Further since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other And las far as I know even criminals in prison are not left to burn to death in a By cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area the gov't guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal Any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you The government says it so it must be so Or haven't you been reading this thread well enough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story No one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the first place They are a scarce A bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood of a resource that might be required in a genuine Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires Besides as I explained some of us here believe their distress might have been Are you SO certain it wasn't The gov't conveniently forgot all that freedom of religion' stuff Freedom of religion does not include human Nor does it include other forms of There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice either before of after the initial And self defense is not The gov't arguably started or at least fanned the fire themselves The govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral He did not say it was Accidents do not require conspiracy theories only wanton disregard for human The initial raid alone agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce ment procedure proves they did not mind killing Finally and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there but Koresh's original reasons for holing up in such a compound may have something to do with the continual interference from the gov't new taxes new regulations and increasing involvement in every aspect of our personal and economic lives Life on a compound might become the way of the future it might have to be Let us hope that those who support Koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon the rest of No one here is supporting Koresh We are opposing the illegal use of excessive violence by our government against our That is Their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their nightmare vision of the A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious views will destroy itself in due It is the feds who disrupted the fabric of society in Waco not It is the feds who forced a nightmare onto the people of Mount It would be a good thing for people to study On what basis do you assume we haven't Don't you really mean It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from history that I do In particular a group of Militant implies acts of aggression against one's The Davidians left their neighbors heretics who left to set up such a community some time A few years latter they had captured Medina and destroyed the idols in the Within ten years the whole of Arabia was under So what The Mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are When they finally got to set up a community they left people So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon hordes crying to avenge Joseph Just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be left alone does not mean that that is how they will It doesn't mean they won't Anyway the whole purpose of a system of laws is to punish people for what they DO not what they MIGHT The Pat Robertsons Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggarts of this world are quite telling other people how to run their Telling is not the same as forcing When the police knock at my door I cannot make them go away by changing the As for Pat and friends I don't even WATCH their channel since I am an So far not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed If you allow such people to get guns and point them in your face you are likely to find that they are running your Right now the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the And they are trying very hard to run my Or haven't you noticed Phill Hallam Baker Christian Struble College Libertarians of Texas UH Chapter Box Calhoun Houston TX The true
