From Lance Bledsoe Subject URGENT TED FRANK WANTED FOR KILLING AJ account that Many important issues and some not so important ones are discussed here on the net on a daily I have just been informed of what I feel is one of the most important things that we could ever discuss The out and out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people don't like what he says or We have all seen the postings here by AJ Although many of us have not agreed with their content I'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in I for one am greatful to live I thought in a country where people like Teel are allowed to say what they If I don't wan't to read it I can just skip on by or But unfortunately some people cannot let others live and let They feel an overwhelming need to snuff out the little Now it seems that Teel will be with us no more due mainly to our brother and cheif net police Ted PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET POST ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse NOT Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that you may understand this vial act for what it forwarded Newsgroups Subject Officer Ted Frank Thought Police Badge Number NWO Summary Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent Expires Sender Teel Sui Juris Followup To Distribution Organization University of Colorado Boulder Keywords NWO Ted Frank Well well Thanks to Mark Eckenwiler and Ted Frank my account is to be I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal They ONLY Ted and Mark have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the In his defense Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad it has been posted in one of the newsgroups However it was not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via While I disagree with Ted I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him Name calling was not enough jumping on every post I made was not enough ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT Even now I do not wish to have him axed but I do wish to express my disgust about Argumentum ad silence your opponent um I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo to himself I think The issue that seems to be Is the following an advertisement Apparently Ted and Mark think I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken off the net from last If reposting an article constitutes posting an ad then I am This post did have a name and address and yes a If one had posted the address and subscription price of Newsweek would that be an ad I get nothing from showing this I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of proof that was REQUESTED BY TED He then complains to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and lo and behold poof there goes my This one had an address in it Oh no I Guess that means it is an ad If you value the alternative view I have been discussing or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the They rarely get Ya know that user on your net was real or whatever they only get I don't like what that user is doing Please do not send the note to the I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying Thanks for the info or Could you send me such and such or Your posts are very keep it and only a handfull of Go aways But I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense TM of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about Knock My name is Ted and and this is We're from the thought Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here and we're here to confiscate NWO Indeed Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new Thanks Ted and Hope you are I will be on for a few more days and that's all folks Your comments and support are I can no longer post to I ask what this has Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish Not in my Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut Images of ah but And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging Oh It takes time to come up with the info requested and I was just getting It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the Further what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of interest to the government and Ted sure seems to have a personal interest in debunking just who does he work for The University of Chicago which he attends is well known as one of the biggest NWO And finally if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder Denver area I would greatly appreciate I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC IP Any help here would be greatly Since I am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY soon I hope that anyone who

Sui Juris Editor's Note The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct Ted Frank It's inexcusable to post lines of bounced mail headers to four A simple four line post would have been Resolution Lazlo yes i BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone here we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings by flaming the user into shape which i assume this is ment to be we CS operations don't like to get involved in this stuff unless its illegal repetitive posts of gifs harassment or something else that offends the community in general my suggestion is that you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look like or tell him to RTFM laz Editor's note Obviously Ted had no such intention of doing ted frank However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound if you follow it the u of c law school you will probably wind up in standard disclaimers James Donald in Editor's Note From this it seems obvious that Ted Frank has an axe to Why that particular quote Sure makes me Lance Bledsoe Ye shall know the TRUTH and the TRUTH shall make you
