From Mitchell S Todd Subject Re WACO burning David Garrod It is interesting sometimes to listen to news as seen through the eyes of another world news service on short wave originating out of London reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank when making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene lamp and that is how the fire Attempts were made by the people inside to put out the fire but it spread too Has anyone in heard anything similar or are government spin doctors censoring such information It was on CBS The explanation is reasonable Then again if the fire was accidental why didn't more people get out The news is also reporting that about of those that died were british That's I think there were several Australians in the group as Mitchell S Todd ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '
