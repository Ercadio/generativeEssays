From Ervan Darnell Subject Re Limiting Govt was Re Employment was Re Why not In article Steve Hendricks writes In article Grinch writes In article Steve Hendricks Of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using government power for their own But apart from that little This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a Another approach is to try and amend the The original constitution restrained the government from economic intervention for to years depending on just how one wants to count The First Amendment though weakened in many ways still restrains government particularly state and local even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of I think libertarians would be happy with another years of restraint via an amendment or two not that I think that's likely to happen Not necessarily Hendricks but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism that it cannot be That might be true but it is not an objection to libertarianism per If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again we would just be back where we are This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist Ervan Darnell
