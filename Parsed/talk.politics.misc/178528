From PA David Veal Subject Re re fillibuster In article Phill Hallam Baker writes In article PA David Veal writes Come to that under the original plan there wasn't meant to be anything much for the federal government to do except keep the British That's also untrue but at least we're wandering a little closer toward That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough proof it was there for just a tad bit Well yes and The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from There are a couple of ways to look at One is We want you to support this Constitution so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you or the more straightforward This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good You clearly consider the former to be the primary They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true Well I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government And is writing in support of something automatically propoganda to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty wide Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock set I wasn't aware the House of Lords had wide I was under the impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons and certainly didn't have almost equal their The Senate is restricted only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was In fact they both were because the British government had much greater power than did the American system My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely no reason to believe the Senate wasn't intended to make use of their law making In fact grid lock appears to have been designed into the system with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act as a check on the more often elected The system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up a bit too I The system is not too slow it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it As somebody in Washington put it whose name I forget Congress has become everybody's city Congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local It is not a case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to Namely a concentration of It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be some sort of rubber stamp for the House You'll note that while the President's veto may be over ridden the House can't do anything about a veto by the The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an extraordinary The veto was clearly regarded as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the I fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were placed on the It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive's opinion There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their I am really curious how you single Bush out as the President who abused the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body it is meant as a check on unrestrained That is the extra measure built into the constitution in favour of the status quo of the representatives of the states is not a reasonable Why is it not a reasonable restriction Because Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based If Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isn't that enough to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re evaluate it Why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which covers million people in very very diverse places and living in radically different conditions Why shouldn't a super majority be required Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be I do not see this as a positive And for all that I'm sure the Republicans are looking for pork as much as the Democrats they've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I'm beginning to think you don't love
