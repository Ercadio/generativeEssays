Briefing Room EDT MYERS Okay today's As you know the President jogged this morning with Senator At he will have a photo opportunity in the Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year At he will meet with his principal advisors on And at he'll meet with President Vaclav There will be a photo op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference Any questions Q Is he moving towards some major decision this week on Bosnia MYERS As we've said he's continuing to discuss his He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors his Bosnia advisors as well as with other world He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today and he'll continue to discuss We don't have any specific timetable but obviously the situation there is very Q Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday MYERS I don't believe he's spoken to her Q Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at MYERS He He answered a question about it Q Before anything had MYERS Before anything He put out Q Since something has happened he's had nothing to MYERS He's put out a statement on it last And we'll have more to say about it later Q In what forum is that going to be MYERS It will be at the photo in the Rose Q He will talk about Waco at that MYERS Yes he'll have something to Q Is that something we can take live MYERS I think it will be We can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it But I don't know if it's something you'd want to take Q Will he take questions on Waco at that time as well MYERS He'll probably take a Q Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the Attorney General MYERS I'll have to double I don't know that he hasn't talked to her this Q And she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else MYERS Q And he didn't talk yesterday Q What's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night MYERS She was asked a question about it and she answered the The President has absolutely no intention of asking for the Attorney General's He stands behind her As you know he was informed about the He takes full responsibility for that and stands percent behind Attorney General Q The question now arises yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the Was he fully informed on all of that all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed et cetera MYERS He talked with the Attorney General about the decision about she talked to him about the factors that led to her He raised no He supports her decision to go forward with He was fully Q Of course hindsight is but looking back now does the President does the White House feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened MYERS I think everybody feels bad when life is But I don't think that that is reason to second guess the He stands behind the decision that was He was informed about He was fully briefed about it and he stands percent behind the Attorney General the Justice Department and the It's a difficult operation and there's it had already gone on for more than seven Four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty let's not forget This was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very But all the agents on the ground the FBI the Justice Department all recommended moving forward with They thought given the circumstances it was the best possible course of There's just no point in second guessing those Now I think that there's a reason Q Why not They have to MYERS No not to second guess the I think it's important to take a look at it to have an I think the President will talk some about that later But at this from this vantage point to second guess those decisions it's not Q You sound like he's going to order an investigation of what happened and whether MYERS I think he'll have more to say about that later Q He will order an investigation MYERS He'll have more yes he'll have more to say about an Q What kind of investigation MYERS He'll have more to say about it Q But in the Monday morning quarterbacking surely there is some soul searching now as to whether it was the right You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather a MYERS I think we'll obviously we'll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was But again the President stands behind the decisions that were made and we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to Q What was the FBI Director's role in this MYERS Well he was obviously involved in setting up the He signed off on it as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with I don't believe he spoke to the President but I'll double check Q But he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth MYERS I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what aspects he was involved Q Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House today MYERS There's no planned I don't believe that she'll be Q She won't be at this event at MYERS No no plans to Q Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of to the President's detriment politically MYERS Well I would certainly hope that people wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political Obviously I think again that it's useful to look at the facts to reevaluate the facts and I think the President will move forward with But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in I don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the Q Dee Dee what was the White House role in handling the I guess public relations aspect in the aftermath Who was talking who here at the White House was talking with people at Justice to set up Reno's news conference to do all that sort of thing MYERS I think the Attorney General handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information I think to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the Obviously people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening Q But Reno said that she didn't talk to the President and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to anybody at the White So who MYERS There were people talking on a staff to staff Q I But who at the Justice Department was handling that for Reno Who was talking to the White House MYERS There were a number of As you know Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House and I know he talked to a number of people There were a number of people at a number of different levels I don't want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom but there were a number of Obviously the Justice Department was working to keep the White House informed the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the Q Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President MYERS I don't believe I don't know if he talked he may have at one Q And was the White House role just to seek information about what happened or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed MYERS It was both to keep abreast of the situation so the President could be on top of it but I think the Justice Department managed its press relations on We were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day and the President was following it very closely throughout the Q Dee Dee on that though if the President was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet Reno why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then MYERS Again I don't know if he's talked to her this Again he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the He stands percent behind her He's been fully supportive of her as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written Q But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday MYERS One more time I don't know if they've spoken this Q No Q Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day MYERS That's just not I think we said throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility that he stands I don't know how much clearer we can The President stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on He accepts full responsibility for the events that He believes that Janet Reno the Justice Department and the FBI acted as best they could given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her Q One of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell MYERS Again I don't know whether they've spoken this Q Why can't we find out MYERS Well we I can't do it standing here right Q You've got six people All they've got to do is pick up the MYERS Helen we'll get back to Q Dee Dee when the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the Davidians MYERS I think that they discussed the Again I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him but I think that he was aware of the risks Q Dee Dee the President yesterday morning said it was entirely her She then said that she told him what was happening and he said Does the President regard it that he gave the go ahead or that she gave the go ahead MYERS I think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available She informed him about that and he raised no Again I don't know how much clearer we can be about Q And he said The issue is over the MYERS He said Q Does okay mean MYERS The President accepts ultimate Q Dee Dee the President's investigation that he's going to announce would that be conducted by someone outside the administration MYERS Q It would be internal is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation MYERS No it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred Q And you would I assume therefore cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held MYERS To the best of our Q Dee Dee there are two reports out this One that the Justice Department or FBI or whomever apparently had a bug planted inside the And the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the What do you know about those two MYERS Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts this We may get more on it later but at this point I know I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the Q Has the President received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on what they've been able to find out on in the compound now MYERS He's been I don't think that they've gotten into the compound They were still waiting for it to cool I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news But he has been kept up to date on Q Dee Dee the President stands behind Attorney General Reno but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so called experts MYERS He believes that she made he stands behind the decision that she It was the unanimous decision of her advisors of the FBI of the agents on the ground and he supports Q What about the validity of the decisions made on the ground Does he back those MYERS He's not going to second guess decisions Q Dee Dee you just said he stands behind the decision which she Normally in a situation like this the President says I made the But you're saying she made the decision MYERS I'm saying that the President was briefed about the He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for Q But then why do you keep using the terminology the decision that she made rather than the decision that he made MYERS Because as he said yesterday she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department and FBI which is part of the Justice Department and made a decision and then briefed the President on that That is how the chain of command She briefed He signed off on The operation went forward and the President accepts full Q In that chain of command analogy there I want to go back to Sessions a Do you know if this was a plan that came through him to Reno or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement What was his involvement MYERS Again you'd have to go to the Justice Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General and the Q Does the President stand behind Director Sessions MYERS He supports again I don't know how many different ways I can say this he supports the decisions made by the Justice Department and the He fully supports the Attorney General in I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI I want to but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him the one who made the decisions as the head of the Justice As you know the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney The Attorney General made the She informed the President about those He okayed He didn't raise any objections to it and he accepts full Q Do you have based on what you know here at the White House any concerns about William Sessions' performance during this MYERS Nothing to suggest that Q Along those same lines just in your initial review of the situation how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status MYERS I just don't think that had anything to do with I think the agents on the ground the operation went I'm not going to speculate on Q Did the White House express any alarm that Janet Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to Clinton MYERS She was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of I think she did a very admirable The President agrees with Q Before Sunday how often was the President briefed on the situation in Waco MYERS He was kept updated on a regular basis on a daily Q Who briefed the President MYERS Well I'm not going to get into exactly who what conversations he had with whom but he was kept up to date on the events in He has daily briefings on a number of Q No no was this a regular briefing conducted by a White House staff person or was it by a Justice Department person MYERS He's briefed regularly by a White House staff on a number of Again I'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what Q Another subject Q On another Q Now we're going to do gays in the MYERS I welcome Q How close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty MYERS As you know the President's giving a speech on Earth Day We'll have more to say about it Q Any details on where or when that speech is yet MYERS It's at and I don't know where Q Dee Dee is this a major policy address How would you characterize the speech tomorrow MYERS I would characterize it as a Earth Day I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these But again I don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about Q On or off campus Q Is this at a location outside the White House MYERS It will be somewhere in We don't know exactly where Q Dee Dee what foreign leaders has the President talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia MYERS Only Prime Minister And again he'll try to reach President Mitterrand again this Q David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work that the Serbs are not going to sign Does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on MYERS Obviously the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in As you know the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of Eastern Bosnia is quite And the President will meet with his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on Q Is that a question they're going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable MYERS Again they'll be reviewing a number of options including the peace Q Does the group that he's meeting with today include Reg Bartholomew MYERS I don't believe he's But it will be among the usual Secretary Christopher Secretary Aspin General Q Dee Dee do you have anything on the apparent encounter by F over Bosnia today some aircraft violating the no fly zone MYERS No I don' I'll get back to you on Q Will the President be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum MYERS He He'll be meeting as you know with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow and then with the rest of the group tomorrow Q As a group or one by one MYERS I believe it's as a Now Havel and Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are Q Dee Dee has the President decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act And has anything been worked out for him to address the march on Sunday MYERS I think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the We haven't worked out the exact details of Q Not a live phone hook up MYERS Probably not given the logistics of getting to The speech as you know is at The answer to the other part of your question is no he hasn't taken a position on Q You said that speech in Boston was at MYERS I believe so Q Do you know what it's on MYERS We'll still working out Q General Vessey's coming back tonight from When will he be meeting with the President MYERS No specific meeting is We'll talk to him at some point and We look forward to his report but exactly how he'll make that report is Q So he's not going to come immediately to the White House MYERS Q The AIDS czar how close are you MYERS Still working on Q Drug czar Q Do you expect it before the march MYERS I don't have a time line on Q Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster MYERS I don't believe Q Why not MYERS He's just not going Q Are Senate Democrats here at this hour MYERS No that's tomorrow tomorrow at Q Update on the stimulus possible scaling down MYERS As you know the Senate will vote on amendments We'll continue to The President is committed to some kind of a jobs package we'd like to see it And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end Q When this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to Janet Reno MYERS We'll be happy Q It's become a pressing question for the last several MYERS No just this minute that I've been here and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it Q Does he have an opinion on Hatfield MYERS I mean obviously he prefers he offered a compromise package of He believes that that's the best alternative believes that he's obviously willing to take a second look at the And I think the Senate will vote on that today and we're hopeful that the President's bill which will be the Mitchell amendment will be the one that will be Q Dee Dee is there any White House official that will be at the march on Sunday MYERS Somebody will be there representing the I don't know who Q Well has it been decided how he's going to address Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call MYERS I think it will probably be a letter but there hasn't been a final decision on that Q The official will read the letter is that what it sounds like MYERS Q Lloyd Bentsen came in here this Do you know what was that about Was that about this Waco thing MYERS No actually it wasn' It may have come up but it was about economic Q On health care is the of May still the target MYERS That's still the Q And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress speech at the end of May MYERS We haven't resolved exactly how the President will present the health care plan to the I wouldn't rule that out as an option but no decisions have been EDT
