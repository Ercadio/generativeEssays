From Will Steeves Subject Re Anita out pubic hairs Oh please PROVE IT Theodore Kaldis In article Will S eeves writes Lani Herrmann We are wondering why the Clinton administration is having so much trouble finding a suitable nominee for the post of Attorney General when there is an obviously superior candidate We refer of course to Anita Michael Friedman Probably because if they pick her the Republicans will investigate the rumors that she sometimes returned papers to her students with a couple of pubic hairs inserted between the While I'm hardly one of Hill's biggest fans I find this hard to Could you please supply with a post preferably some proof of this newspaper articles documenting such allegations Well your ignorance about this is unsurprising given you're a And I'm at a complete loss at to why you should be so interested in this given that it is an American issue which should properly be of absolutely no concern to you at Actually my interest in gender issues is not limited to international Indeed I often exchange information with Americans about issues which concern us in both In any event in answer to your question the following is taken from David Brock's article The Real Anita Hill published in the March issue of The American Spectator This is taken from page had mentioned this journal but gave no further But the most bizarre incident is alleged to have happened in the school year at Oral Roberts University according to a sworn affidavit dated October and filed with the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Lawrence Shiles now a lawyer in Tulsa recounted the following Shortly after the class had begun Professor Hill gave us a written assignment which I completed and duly turned When this assignment was passed out to the class after having been marked by the professor sitting next to me were fellow students Jeffrey Londoff and Mark Upon opening the assignments and reviewing our grades and comments made by Anita Hill I found ten to twelve short black pubic hairs in the pages of my I glanced over at Jeff Londoff's assignment and saw similar pubic hairs in his At the time I made the statement to Londoff that either she had a low opinion of our work or she had graded our assignment in the Mark Stewart overheard the conversation and said that he had similar pubic hairs in his assignment This became the standing joke among many students for the remainder of the year in Other students in that class confirmed the Londoff says he couldn't be certain that the hairs were pubic but he said he thought it was unlikely that they could have come from Hill's head since they were short coarse and curly and Hill had had the hair on her head Another student who saw the hair but did not want to be identified said of its origins You just know when you see Does this satisfy you Yes thank you though I am really curious as to why this never came out at least not in what I saw up here in Canada or on CNN which is sent up here during the Thomas nomination Surely one would think that her claim to having been sexually harassed would have a great deal less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of or do you regard sworn statements given to a Senate committee as equivalent to toilet paper It For instance if it were the sworn statements at the Warren Commission then yes I would say that the statements were no better than toilet paper used at that but in most cases the answer would be no Will Steeves Neil Hull is GOiD ZOOiD BBS Toronto Ontario The Zoo Of Ids GOiDS Rule Solve Patriarchy Install Peterarchy Peter Hanus UPEI SLMR Scott me up
