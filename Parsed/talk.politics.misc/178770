From Phill Hallam Baker Subject Re Welcome to Police State USA In article Lawrence C Smith writes The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked assault assumes that the BATF were on a death Had they expected the B D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day This is That is no paranoid assertion it is testamony from surviving witnesses and the BATF has no tanks nor am I aware of either the BATF or the FBI using any until When they use maximum force they do just what they did that first day that got four officers These surviving witnesses being members of which cult pray tell The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by ludicrously underarmed and unprotected Underarmed You flabberghast me they were loaded for bear and every picture shows them wearing bullet proof vests They were using concussion grenades and full auto weapons what was missing low yield tac nukes This is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount of force used both initially and You should be We were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything On the basis of Panama Grenada Tripoli Kewait etc we decided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike or used a cruise missile some people suggested that he would have used the nuke warhead cruise others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use ' What was missing Armoured vehicles If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could hear They had a sure fire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or surrender without giving him justification for some looney tune religious Phil I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you will back anything no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't It's people with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust a process that is in place now in this country even if the tattered pitiful remains of the Constitution is slowing its This isn't a Libertarian issue others may argue that line but from a strictly Constitutional view of a democratic gov't what the FBI and BATF did was wrong wrong wrong even if their reasons for trying to arrest Koresh were Anything that leads to the deaths of children if nothing else touches your stoney heart is wrong no matter who pushed the For God's sake man get your morality The person who murdered children was He kept them there and brought about their deaths You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice Thats quite I don't pretend to Being nice is what amateurs try to If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting to rescue the Anyone who has held the office of President of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear Holocaust in order to protect Beleive it or not that is not the sort of threat that nice chaps Do they have a gun nutters section of the US version of CND by any chance There are cases where society has to be protected from madmen such as Koresh or If it were not for the consideration of the children in there the question of the tactics to be used would not be a matter of anything but academic It is not for the govt to prevent people from commiting mass The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the If proven that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to promote Koresh as some sort of role model or I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch Phill Hallam Baker
