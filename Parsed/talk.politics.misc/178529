From Matt Freivald Subject Re NLNS Fascism with a Friendly Face Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist support This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People are incapable of thinking for This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist In article in

Fascism with a Friendly Face Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of Anyone Daevid Bornhuetter Machen The Madison Edge The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that Hitler was original and showed Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show ABC Radio Network October Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Limbaugh I find him entertaining and I often agree with his The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more NLNS Believe it or not I was planning this comparative review of Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant The Way Things Ought to Be before Sahl issued his comparative As usual Sahl's was independent and sharp as a My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort' At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise everyone I'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions in fact Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April German election Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological Actually I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking even though his conclusions are often I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the right things where right is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement is showing an acute case of myopic social perspective not to mention arrogance and utter Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated like errant children by a self important group of arrogant controlling myopic people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the oughta be's inside their own hopelessly closed The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both Hitler's example is when on page he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg being caught in the act in was betrayed to France by a representative of his government when there has never been any factual foundation for such a In fact the governments of both the Reich and Prussia as well as the Vatican actively intervened to save him from execution and almost OK let us take your word for that and work with A nice specific Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public God is Of course it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual's will that's But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know Hmmm Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion nor prohibiting the free exercise Liberal translation the federal government as long as it is run by Liberals may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays while prohibiting I think Limbaugh has you on this It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into Nice job on the specificity of that one Analysis of historical modern communication media deleted But as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their And remember Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media the radio program's production company But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show having hosted them in New York Washington and Los He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did it's almost worthy of a RICO Ah yes it is a conspiracy of profound Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck Do you feel this same level of knee jerk resentment against lottery winners or do you congratulate them on their good fortune On questions of social issues there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's For example This should be great fun since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business government business 'partnership' indeed and Limbaugh is the populist nemesis of that I have read Limbaugh's book and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain venom at all let alone venom comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society Hitler Out of the host of sometimes millions of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man author's emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses granite principles and to take up the fight for their sole correctness until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises page A very serious tone in that Limbaugh Who needs the media when they've got me The show is devoted exclusively to what I think the phrase with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me It might take four or five years but I'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking kicking and screaming all the pages and You neglect to mention that Limbaugh have you ever listened to his show BTW continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon himself You yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own He also adopts a rather satirical approach and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness and he says as much This is in contrast to the average mass media show in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be On Religion as the Basis of a Nation Hitler In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the His dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Page This is not religion it is clearly a perverse worship of Since Christ was a Jew it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as the highest image of the Lord fits with Christian Limbaugh America was founded as a Judeo Christian country But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since pages Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded American history is indeed primarily Judeo I suppose that Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan I think you might be reaching just a wee bit On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse Hitler The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses vaudevilles and theatres and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food Theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and pages and Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry Limbaugh Today Hollywood is in The reason is that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is They make fun of people who believe in They ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and They disparage American page Just a guess here but I don't think that Limbaugh would advocate government control of You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses not an advocation of government control of 's Liberals on the other hand want to have complete government control of our school systems so that the government can teach The People at an early age the right way to view religion and I believe Limbaugh is against this as his satirical use of the young heads full of mush hyperbole On the News Meida Hitler The activity of the so called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters the Page Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the Limbaugh Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes During the Gulf war CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw said CNN is a global We can't take Cant take sides If they don't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided and may I suggest flirting with pages and Indication here that Elements of the Media since career is a self selected categorization perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large' has a leftist Doesn't sound too No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to You may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it is not an unreasonable opinion and Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other in a statistical sense reflect the biases of the Who is being disingenuous here Shaw or Limbaugh Again you should ask Limbaugh himself but I expect that he would oppose government control of the To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible but ultimately too depressing to take in one It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind not the real After putting these books down there is one undeniable fact that haunts In the Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them in turn it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the In the Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans in turn it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the year nightmare of the Reagan Bush era comes to an end hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate monger but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self importance of the Left not As to Bush you may be correct about his fascist economic Reagan on the other hand did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in Clinton is increasing fascism in America through business government partnership and increased levels of Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many many others out of I come from a mixed race family so I am quite well attuned to racism I don't hear any coming from Rush The only place I hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine Socialized Transportation Socialized Education The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to that Liberal drug the Social Security Chain It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the Fascist The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box Madison WI
