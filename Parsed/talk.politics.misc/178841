From Dan Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage Brian Drakula Stone writes The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual The median number of sexual partners for all men was Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men gay bi men that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay bi men Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality uses a very flawed IMHO source of information to pass jusgement on all homosexual and bisexual It would seem more logical to say that since the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity larger as In my opinion orientation has nothing to do with I don't understand what you are getting at If the chances of promiscuity are larger yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual community doesn't that imply that the homo bi sexual population is then even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics Men are men and they all like I am a gay I have had sex three times in my life all with the same Before that I was a I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life my wife It is very pleasing to me to be able to say I hope you have the same feeling as I I also wish that you could if you wanted experience the joys and trials of being committed to someone for life there is something about marriage that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect whose promiscuous Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no Just because someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they Look at the Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default Don't forget about the Sadly we don't as a society look upon homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot of people who condemn it As a result the gay population is not encouraged to develop non promiscuous In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed It is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays are My if we allowed gays to marry raise children we might just find out they're as moral as we are can't have that can we Just some Flame Dan
