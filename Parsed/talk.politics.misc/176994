if you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),
and direct aid, i'd be very interested to see it. if you could give me
references from, for example, congressional budget authorization hearings,
i could look them up here and i'd be happy to post a verification of your
data. otherwise, i'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately i won't have sufficient
time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed. let me know if you're interested in doing this. ___samuel___
