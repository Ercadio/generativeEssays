From James Reynolds Subject HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT Re will they ever learn In article William A Bacon writes They Refuse To Learn From History Or From the Present Pointing to Canada's vaunted socialized medical care program he contends that it is failing even while the cost is catching up with angry He notes Americans don't go to Canada and elsewhere for medical care it's the Canadians and others who come Why should the United States duplicate what doesn't work well in other countries We have the world's best medical care let's not mess it up with Hillary Clinton's plans for socialized John McManus National President of the John Birch Society When McManus says We have the world's best medical care I can hardly believe he's referring to a system That costs us percent of our GDP while there isn't a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than That leaves million of us with no coverage even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually Yet Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many preventable We pay on average about each for To put that in perspective they cost in The average US company spends over dollars a year per employee on health Seven hundred to is the range just about everywhere How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world The only thing the USA health care system is good at is showering well insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for And the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society individuals government and Of the billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year the Consumer's Union estimated that at least billion was thrown away on overpriced useless and even downright harmful tests and procedures and the most bureaucratic regulated insurance system in the There are more than different private insurers in the But did the private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork Ask any doctor who's had to hire a full time clerk to deal with it all The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP not The competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous Spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend percent of the day idle isn't my idea of the world's best health care Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally I'm especially thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and Cesarean Sound like the world's best health care system Ever notice how every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care the Libbies start bashing Canada's system First of all Hillary Clinton is not advocating another Canadian I think that's been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of Where did John McManus get that idea anyway Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA Your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city The nearest Canadian cities are hours west and hours east and there's an American city one hour Which way are you going to go Is it because the American system is the best in the world or just for convenience It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and white on health care There are a million different ways we ould restructure the It's not just a choice between total government control and total private I wish the people screaming socialized medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM THEMSELVES on health care The current system I want to keep providers private but that doesn't change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE Purely private health care without any government intervention doesn't Hillary Clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern How can you scream socialized medicine at her programs Don't you even know what you're talking about Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade Notice how the line falls then starts increasing Why I'll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don't do something about PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET The current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well Costs are still rising percent a year even as Americans by the tens of millions go without or are forced into managed care programs which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary bashers to please come forward and present no gimmicks straight talk just how THEY would set about keeping costs I didn't get a single The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like give health care back to the Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms What is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help How can anyone read the news live under our system and NOT see these faults How can we deal with the deficit our cities our educational system our infrastrucure AIDS modernizing our industry if we don't quit throwing away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems America needs health care reform Don't just sit there and Hillary bash inform yourself Jim Reynolds James Reynolds that's Jim to you and
