From Theodore A Kaldis Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage In article optilink COM cramer optilink COM Clayton Cramer writes Some chump at Brandeis I mean, how many people actually CARE how many people are gay as long as you know how to find avoid them if you want to I don't If you don't care, why was so much effort put into promoting the lie Because it was important to scare politicians into obedience I wouldn't worry too much about it, though We are starting to find out how politically impotent homosexuals really are The Colorado boycott has fizzled, Slick Willie was effectively prevented from implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his OWN party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their claims of large numbers, and coming this Saturday they are going to wind up with TREMENDOUS egg on their face when, I submit, no more than perhaps , queers will show up in Washington while they are promising crowds in the millions And most of the ones who will be there will look like ACT UP and Queer Nation, not the guy working in the next cubicle As if that's really going to play in middle America Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet where they belong The views expressed herein are Theodore A Kaldis my own only Do you seriously believe that a major university rutgers remus rutgers edu kaldis as this would hold such views
