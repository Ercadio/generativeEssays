From Roger Subject Re Clayton is an asshole but we all already know that Here's a hypothetical If Clayton said something like all those niggers are really Please don't be offended I'm not racist but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic And then said he read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school I bet he wouldn't have your Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are dishonest evil lying child molesters without PERSONALLY having a single homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support God created a place for It's called Hell and Clayton is going to burn there for a long I pray for him to find in his heart the Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers and sisters because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never be There is a difference between supporting Claytons opinions and supporting his right to I want you to know that you cannot educate and or elevate ones understanding by calling him Clayton has an opinion which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net If you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner city and began the conversation with Those niggers in You would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your second All name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the audience you are trying to Clayton is guilty of that and as such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces of his I don't understand why people want to repeat his mistakes Hanging by the tips of my finger at the edge of the internet
