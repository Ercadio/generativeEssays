From William A Bacon Subject some scientists do not believe in the green house effect The following statement was released on February by the Science Environmental Policy Project As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems we are concerned by the agenda for UNCED the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development being developed by environmental and activists groups and certain political This so called Earth Summit is scheduled to convene in Brazil in June and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations including onerous taxes on energy fuels on the population of the United States and other industrialized Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific They are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate We do not A survey of Atmospheric scientists conducted in the summer of confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past A recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability which is directly proportional to solar activity rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about Futhermore the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical Finally agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food We are disturbed that activists anxious to stop energy and economic growth are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying We fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy on jobs standards of living and health care with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the David Aubrey PhD Senior Scintist Woods Hole Oceanographic Nathaniel Guttman PhD Research Physical Scientist National Climatic Data Hugh Ellsaesser PhD Meteorologist Lawerence Livermore National Richard Lindzen PhD Center for Meteorology and Physical Meteorolgy Massachusetts Institute of Robert Balling PhD Director Laboratory of Climatology Arizona State Patrick Micheals PhD Professor of Environmental Sciences Universityy of Roger Pielke PhD Professor of Atmospheric Science Colorado State Micheal Garstang PhD Professor of Meteorology University of Sherwood Idso PhD Research Physicist Water Conservation Lev Gandin PhD Visiting Scientist National Center for Atmospheric John McGinley Chief Forecast Research group Forecast Systems Laboratory Jean Thiebaux PhD Research Scientist National Meterological Center National Weather Service Kenneth Beard PhD Professor of Atmospheric Physics University of Paul Mielke PhD Professor Department of Statistics Colorado State Thomas Lockhart Meteorological Standards Peter Giddings Meterologist Weather Service Hazen bedke Meteoroligist Former Regional Director National Weather Gabriel Csanady PhD Eminent Professor Old Dominion Roy Leep Executive Weather Director Gillet Weather Data Terrance Clark Meteorologist Air Neil Frank PhD Meteorologist National Weather Bruce Boe PhD Director North Dakota Atmospheric Resource Andrew Detweiler PhD Professor Institute of Atmospheric Sciences South Dakota School of Mines And Robert Cunningham Consulting Meteorologist Fellow American Meteorological Stephen Hanna PhD Sigma Research Corporation Elliot Abrams Meteoroligist Senior Vice President AccuWeather William Reifsnyder PhD Consulting Meteorologist professor Emeritus Forest Meteorology Yale David Reylnolds Research Jerry Williams Meteorologist President Ocean Routes Lee Eddington Meteorologist Geophysics Division Pacific Missile test A Braum PhD Former Dean College of Arts Sciences Florida State Rodgers PhD Professor of Research Oceanography Scripps Institution of Brian Fiedler PhD Asst professor of Meteorology University of Edward Brandes Melvyn Shapiro Chief of Meteorological Research Wave Propagation Laboratory Joesph Zabransky Associate professor of Meteorology Plymouth State James Moore Project Manager Research Applications program national Center for Atmospheric Daniel J McNaughton ENSR Consultating and Brian Sussman Meteorologist Fellow American Meteorologist fellow American Meteorological H Read McGrath PhD Robert Zabrecky William Porch PhD Atmospheric Physicist Los Alamos national Earle Williams PhD Associate Profesor of Meteorology of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Fred Singer PhD Atmospheric Physsicist University of Virginia Director Science Environmental Policy Affilitions listed are for identification purposes only William A Bacon The Cellar BBS
