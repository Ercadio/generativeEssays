From Ted Frank Subject Re The state of justice In article Not a Boomer writes In article Tim Smith writes What kind of witnesses If we are talking about witnesses who were at the accident or were otherwise directly involved paramedics emergency room doctors then they should have been used at the first You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and forgot to call all of your They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first While it would be tough luck for GM if they new about these witnesses beforehand IMO this constitutes new evidence The test isn't whether GM knew otherwise that would reward GM for its The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their It works both ways if GM had won the trial and the plaintiff turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should have been located beforehand too bad so sad no new Like Tim said you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up the first time Unlike the criminal justice system repose is much more important in the civil justice ted frank I'm sorry the card says the u of c law school standard disclaimers
