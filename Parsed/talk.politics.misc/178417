From PA David Veal Subject Re Propaganda Re re fillibuster In article Phill Hallam Baker writes In article VEAL VEAL David Veal writes In article Phill Hallam Baker writes Or are they simply propogranda We can't know what Phill really means because he's obviously using arguments designed to I make no secret of what I am up to I have stated explicitly in posts that I am a political propagandist on numerous Anyone posting to this group who is not probably has the wrong For example I have on numerous occasions stated quite clearly that I beleive that certain factions of the gun lobby are the worst possible advocates of their cause and I am prepared to do anything in my power to provide them with a platform because they can convince people far better than I could hope that many people with a fixation on lethal weapons are dangerous and If you happen to know a political position which does not have people advocating it who do more harm than good please point it Some people have even accused me of inventing such advocates purely for the purpose of having them trash a set of political In fact this would be a futile tactic because I could never hope to invent a character as dangerous as a man who I quite seriously believe to be mentaly ill and a potential Unfortunately the local sherifs office have informed me that they are unable to act untill he attacks One of the advantages and draw backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be So if you were to ask me what is the point that I am trying to make from this current argument on the absolute sanctity of the US constitution what would I answer We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the In fact the fillibuster we're talking about isn't in the I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly Firstly I see that the current US political scene like the UK political scene has become tied to special Rather than chase the convenient caricatures put about by the media and polititians themselves for this Gay rights cmapaigners environmentalists zionists Jews foreign lobbyists whatever voting power they have I sugest that you look at who is really The inevitable conclusion is that it is the major corporations owned by the ultra wealthy that have Regan and Bush created what can only be described as a welfare state for the I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same Bush never had any real support in The real point is that everybody everywhere got their pork from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk food he'd bought with food He spent more in food stamps on junk than I make in a week and I'm not on government Money was diverted from programs addressing social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost plus profits Lessee let's pull out the old In total government budget outlays were billion In est they were trillion dollars an increase of billion In National Defense cost billion In it was billion dollars and increase of billion That leaves an increase of billion dollars unaccounted This represented an increase of In Income Security which includes retirement programs Housing Assitance and unemployment benefits and I believe welfare cost billion In it was billion dollars or more than national defense This represented an increase of In the Federal Government spent billion dollars on In they spent billion an increase of In the Feds spent billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that In it was In Health care services and research was billion In it was billion Agriculture up billion to Science up billion to Resource conservation up billion to Education up billion to Veteran benefits up billion to Trasnportation up billion to About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category primarily under Supply and Community Development in the area of disaster relief and between the two of them represent a loss of less than billion Where was this huge diversion In order to rectify this situation there must be constitutional Not that's a If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed circumsatnces of the role of the Federal Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to I see very little positive about The constitution cannot be used to frustrate the democratic The Constitution was designed to frustrate the democratic process so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it Nor do I see putting the brakes on the democratic process an inherently bad Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets If the peoplr want to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have Sometimes or perhaps most of the time the people should be told no and pointed to their local Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only leads to the constitution being brought into Phill would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in Methods will always be found to bypass such provisions and once the government gets used to bypassing those provisions they will bypass the others up to the first We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the This is a major reason why the right to own guns should be excluded the implication that this right is equal to the right to free speech is Free speech alone is dangerous People know that mass ownership of lethal weapons causes thousands of murders a year the dangerous conclusion they may reach is that the first ammendment may also be the same dangerous OK All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of reduction in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be Not current mind you Note however that this is not the slippery slope It is because the right freedom of speech has been chained to the privilege to own weaponry that the danger The advocates of this pivilege must not be allowed to chain freedom of speech to their cause such that if they fall freedom of speech falls as Such actions are not the actions of people genuinely interested in Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech By calling it a freedom Thirdly and most importantly I want to discover a mechanism wherby I can engender intellectual debate as opposed to totemic I consider the grave threat to civilisation to be the loss of the ability to reason about the political debate at anything other than the superficial The objection I raise to your basing your case entirely on the assertion of the supremacy of the US constitution is that the currency of your argument is limited to the currency of the totem upon which it is The danger of totems is that they can be reinterpreted in different ways by different Phill you're a master of subtly changing the I haven't based my argument against raw democracy on the I've tried to explain why it isn't a good The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were meant but just didn't make it in The Constitution doesn't contain the fillibuster I only believe that the rule is a good You cn't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it isn't in the David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I'm beginning to think you don't love me Weird Al
