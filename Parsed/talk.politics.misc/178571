From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room EDT STEPHANOPOULOS Good Q Could we do this on the lawn STEPHANOPOULOS That would be Let's go out to the cherry We'll do like the Q Is the stimulus package dead STEPHANOPOULOS Absolutely Q Can you tell us more about the Dole talks You said it was a good visit but no STEPHANOPOULOS The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last I think that as we said before there were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as As you know the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid They did not speak Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning when the President was Instead he spoke with Tony Lake and at the close of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus They finally talked about that yesterday At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night which they did when the Senator was up in New And although there were no specific compromises made on either side they did say that they would continue to have some And that's where we Q Well who is giving in Where is it standing are both making concessions STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know that it's at that No compromise has been As the President has said consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted He believes in the package but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it he's willing to make those Q On the subject of a VAT STEPHANOPOULOS Oh Q Can we stay on this for one more minute STEPHANOPOULOS Q We have a problem with the five minutes Q I know no decisions have been made but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary STEPHANOPOULOS Sorry Andrea I'm not going to go down that No decisions have been As the President said this morning a number of groups a number of members of Congress a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked The working group is looking at it but no decisions have been Q To follow have they done that directly through him Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it STEPHANOPOULOS Not to my knowledge although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the But the President has not made a Q At the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think that that has been presented for a decision Q Not for a decision but has it been discussed as an option STEPHANOPOULOS Again there are a lot of levels of I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as okay this is something for you to decide Q You're not saying he didn't know it was being considered though are you STEPHANOPOULOS No he said it's being Q He knew Q But has he discussed that with his advisers That's what I'm STEPHANOPOULOS The President has said it's being I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the It is something the working groups are looking I don't even know that it's Q But he didn't say he was considering did he at this stage STEPHANOPOULOS No he is I think we're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right What is considered Q Well he is the one who said I haven't reviewed STEPHANOPOULOS That is That is what I just Q George is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he'd let us know and having it trickle out the way it did that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think I mean it is now public knowledge that this is being Q Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it come out not from you people but STEPHANOPOULOS Well wait a It came out from the What are you talking about Q What I'm saying is though that the President said he would let us STEPHANOPOULOS Q You people then said you said I believe that it's not going to be on the STEPHANOPOULOS On March Q On March STEPHANOPOULOS Circumstances Q Well I But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview STEPHANOPOULOS Rooting around I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today But this is laughter the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human I mean that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration the headline is I'll look at it right here and AP story Clinton wants more money for Q What about his remark that if it were being considered he'd tell us about it STEPHANOPOULOS And the administration's concerned and he'd let you Q And did he STEPHANOPOULOS What did he say this morning Q It had to be dragged out of you here STEPHANOPOULOS It didn't have to be dragged out of We had the Deputy Director of the OMB we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being That is his That is his administration Q Were these authorized trial balloons or were they orchestrated leaks I mean what was the STEPHANOPOULOS They were asked questions they answered the Q You're saying here that it didn't have to be dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering STEPHANOPOULOS I was very Painfully Q Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day STEPHANOPOULOS No it was just this issue is being They were asked if it was being considered they answered that it was being Q George The New York Times Q Why do it yesterday STEPHANOPOULOS They were Q The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill but which turned out to be totally STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if it was totally false but I think laughter the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they say Q The question is is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data And what's he doing about it if so STEPHANOPOULOS The chief economist has said that a mistake was made it won't happen again and that's the end of the Q Isn't that the same information that goes to the President Q If I could go back to the stimulus package STEPHANOPOULOS There's two separate pieces of I think that's where the confusion Q When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made STEPHANOPOULOS I read the article this Q And as far as you know is the President aware of it STEPHANOPOULOS I think Q And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times STEPHANOPOULOS I don't Not to my Q Did you ever hear about it before this morning Anything STEPHANOPOULOS I didn' Q Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose For his speeches for his arguments STEPHANOPOULOS Well again I'm not Both statements are What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence essentially was They said it was a They said they wouldn't do it Q Did they drop it is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of STEPHANOPOULOS Whenever fewer people are out of work we're But that doesn't take away from the need to get this jobs package Q If I could go back to the stimulus package for a You said that the President plans to come forward with an Is the timetable still what it was that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday or did he in the conversation with Dole talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion STEPHANOPOULOS I think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at I don't know that they discussed the timing like Q Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week STEPHANOPOULOS Again I believe that we're going to pass a jobs The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to I don't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular I don't know what's going to happen until we have a But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it Q Has there been any indication that this situation has changed STEPHANOPOULOS We're going to continue to work on We'll know when the votes are Q George last week you said that there are or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go through Dole you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could This week you're talking to Is that because you've realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work STEPHANOPOULOS That's because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus Q He initiated the conversation STEPHANOPOULOS Q Secretary Reich this morning said that in fact the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at You say he's making STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know that that's exactly what he I think he said he didn't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise and the President doesn't want to And the President doesn't want to But if he has to make adjustments to get it through he Q Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual STEPHANOPOULOS It's Q Today STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not sure exactly when that will happen but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward with some sort of a different package or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it Q As we understood his conversations with Dole the first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase Did he offer him some details or some adjustments STEPHANOPOULOS I think it's a question of how I mean I think they had a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday I believe that there will be follow up discussions today in the Senate not necessarily between the President and Senator And let me just reiterate neither side has made specific compromises at this When we have something we'll let you And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard Q What are the follow up discussions if not the President and Dole STEPHANOPOULOS I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Q Is that a threat Q Did the President say to Senator Dole all right how about this number as an overall size or did Dole say to the President I can go as high as this Did they talk numbers STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think it was a negotiation in that It was more of a discussion about their Q Did they discuss actual numbers STEPHANOPOULOS I'm just not I know they talked about the basic outlines of the I think they talked about the programs they cared I don't know if they got to the level of this many x billion Q Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package STEPHANOPOULOS No of course Q Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking Was that in any way organized by STEPHANOPOULOS Not to my knowledge Q And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think he's talked to them Q George is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have nots And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves having to pay for the have nots STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans as he presented in his budget should go And I think for the second half of your question I'll refer you to my briefing from Q George on the subject of accuracy in information you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Apparently that is not It's actually waste water STEPHANOPOULOS It's waste water money for Wisconsin and some could go to Q But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money right STEPHANOPOULOS It would affect the water treatment Q But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee Would you agree that's not the case STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not sure of the I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Q A leftover question from this morning which was when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not sure exactly I just don't I assume it came up over the last certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days Q So sometime since March STEPHANOPOULOS I think that's I don't know the exact Q George the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT Apparently the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed STEPHANOPOULOS I think we've said all we have to say about the VAT at this I mean there's just no this is being considered by the health care working groups and that is The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond Q But it would be to finance health care it wouldn't be to replace some other tax that finances it wouldn't replace the income tax for instance STEPHANOPOULOS There have been no discussions on Q In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress Senator Dole's press release today said VAT on tax Do you think does it have a chance of getting through Congress Would it have a chance STEPHANOPOULOS I have no Q Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward STEPHANOPOULOS That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do It's not in consideration Q You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under STEPHANOPOULOS Yes what the President referred to this These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be Q Those are the circumstances that have changed That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered STEPHANOPOULOS That's what he Q Is that true STEPHANOPOULOS Q Was there in fact some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not going to get into the Q But George STEPHANOPOULOS What the consideration is as the President said groups came forward and said this is something you ought to The working groups are looking at Q Is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT STEPHANOPOULOS Q Can you explain how those groups how that information got to him that groups wanted it Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations STEPHANOPOULOS I think the groups as you know the health care task force has met with dozens of Q But this is the President's knowledge that these groups had come STEPHANOPOULOS I think he was referring to what was coming to the working Obviously there have also been published positions in the Q Have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if they've briefed him I mean how detailed the briefings have I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these Q What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know it's just they've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health Q The President wasn't aware of those longstanding positions STEPHANOPOULOS He may have been at some Obviously he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT Q What we're trying to figure out here you're telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February and now STEPHANOPOULOS The President's attitude hasn't necessarily I mean he has not made a Q I know but the President said that it was off the So did And you're saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups except you're also describing them as longstanding I don't see the If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been made to the President STEPHANOPOULOS Well they've made the presentations to the health care task Q There's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the Q Well he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health STEPHANOPOULOS He did say I don't know that he said anything to refute Q But in fact has the task force discovered that there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don't think that the task force ever suggested that there Q George if he advocated a VAT tax would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs STEPHANOPOULOS I can't comment on a hypothetical Q But does that promise would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax STEPHANOPOULOS The President has made no decisions on the VAT When he does we'll tell you and we'll explain the implications Q Which specific groups can you cite business labor or otherwise whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration STEPHANOPOULOS I don't have the I just don't have Q George can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are STEPHANOPOULOS No as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking at a wide variety of I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are different options under But I'm not going to comment Q What's the scope STEPHANOPOULOS I'm just not going to comment on them Q What's the scope of the need How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the STEPHANOPOULOS That's what the health care task force is looking Q Since there's not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit two questions One generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference STEPHANOPOULOS The Vancouver note Q Does no mean Q Yes and STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don't I saw the Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the that we want to do something Q Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of Are you going to oblige STEPHANOPOULOS I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very I don't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister's Q that we need specific export targets specific numerical targets is that what he's going to discuss with Miyazawa STEPHANOPOULOS They're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade I don't want to get into those specifics until after the Q Why Q That's the crux of the issue right Whether or not does the President believe that without specific numerical targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be Q But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance STEPHANOPOULOS I think first the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself and then he'll make the comment on Q How about the Russian aid package There seems to be some confusion about how the views that Secretary Christopher saying or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard STEPHANOPOULOS Again we're going to continue to work with all our allies in the G and we're going to continue to press for help for Russian reform Russian democratic And I think that so far we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral Q Do you think the Japanese need to do more STEPHANOPOULOS We're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we Q Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on the Bosnia And he said It's a rather emotional STEPHANOPOULOS Over an emotional Q Right to an emotional Does the White House condone that kind of remark STEPHANOPOULOS I think that Secretary Christopher's remarks speaks for The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find answers Q But that specific rather emotional response specific term STEPHANOPOULOS No it speaks for Q In connection with that doesn't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum STEPHANOPOULOS For example Q To take stronger action to take military action air strikes anything that can be done STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for He is also as you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this Q What is your response to the critics who would say that the is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency STEPHANOPOULOS They're We're pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating We're pressing hard for increased sanctions and we're talking to our allies about the arms Q You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to Now Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be Does that change your thinking STEPHANOPOULOS Clearly we're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to But at this point the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms Q A follow up on a Dee Dee comment this She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Are you going to be able to do that or do you have anything STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think that's what she Q That's exactly what she STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think that's But what she said we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Obviously if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade that will have an effect over I do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has But clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods into We are having an effect on the Serbs What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all I don't know why they'd be fighting it so Q Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be released STEPHANOPOULOS I think there's a joint tax And it will be probably later Q Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think there's any proposal for that at this time not that I know Q It's something that the President promised during the campaign that he would STEPHANOPOULOS I have not seen any I don't think it's anything that's on his plate right Q Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know about on this I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and Q Do you know if that's scheduled STEPHANOPOULOS It's probably going to be Q Probably going to be tomorrow Q It's a good thing you Q Who's probably going to be there STEPHANOPOULOS I don't Q How long STEPHANOPOULOS I don't That's all I Q Do you know if it's at tomorrow STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know what time it I don't even know for sure if it's going to be Q Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some Is that going to happen do you know STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if they've asked but I think the President has always planned as he did last year to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he If it's not exactly on Earth Day it might be a day before or something like Q Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don't know the specific timing of something like that but it's certainly something under discussion and something we've been working Q Campaign finance reform STEPHANOPOULOS We're working on Q Do you think it will be next week STEPHANOPOULOS I'm just not Q The biodiversity treaty is something you're working on I missed the STEPHANOPOULOS Yes something we're working He asked if it was ready to be signed and I said I didn't know anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working Q Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups STEPHANOPOULOS I don' Q Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march STEPHANOPOULOS He's got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown and I believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday as he did last Q Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question STEPHANOPOULOS On what Q On the STEPHANOPOULOS When we went through the President's schedule for the day Q George what day is the publisher's speech Is that Sunday STEPHANOPOULOS I think it's a Q And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown STEPHANOPOULOS Q So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one day STEPHANOPOULOS No I'm not I don't know how long the Senate thing It might go I just don't Q You would have made the gay meeting public right STEPHANOPOULOS I'm certain if we had the meeting I don't know about open to the press but we would have told you about Q I mean because it is as far as I can tell the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with STEPHANOPOULOS I didn't say it was going to be in the Oval But I didn't I'm not say that it's not but I didn't say that it Q at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done So I just wanted to make sure STEPHANOPOULOS Well the President wouldn't do anything like Q Certainly Q What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey STEPHANOPOULOS They had a very good discussion for about half an hour He wanted the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards He'll be looking at Vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on remains implementing trilateral investigations and access to military And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the Q Vietnam says it's a What is the DOD analysis at this stage STEPHANOPOULOS It's not completed yet and it's also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Q A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the or so prisoners referred to are in fact non Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to Do people STEPHANOPOULOS We don't have any final We're going to wait for the complete review when we have it we'll make a Q I know you don't have any final determination but given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that that's a likely possibility STEPHANOPOULOS I just don't want to characterize it in any way until the review is Q George was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston STEPHANOPOULOS Q Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa STEPHANOPOULOS I think so but I'm not Yes I expect Q Was Toon in with Vessey STEPHANOPOULOS Q He was in on the meeting STEPHANOPOULOS Q What was the question STEPHANOPOULOS Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey and the answer is Q Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that STEPHANOPOULOS Well I do have a I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the I would point out that he's answered questions on occasions more than any of his I would also point out it also Q How many questions STEPHANOPOULOS Three hundred fifty eight on Q How many were while he was jogging STEPHANOPOULOS Well no that's actually a very good question And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently He's had press conferences in either the East Room the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the Q Oval Office press conference when was that STEPHANOPOULOS He's answered questions in the East He's had five in the East Room he's had one in the Oval Office he's had one in the Rose Garden he's had one or two in the Roosevelt And this is just to the White House Washington Press In addition to that he's had interviews with local television He's met with the editorial board of The Portland He's had an hour long interview with Dan He's had interviews with local press from California Florida and Connecticut Q Can you address the question of the attitude The article implies that he doesn't Q Why doesn't he like us Q Did you really get blamed for that Post story Q The story is that you are you held responsible for STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think I'm going to comment about Q Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly STEPHANOPOULOS I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and Q Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber STEPHANOPOULOS What Q The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player STEPHANOPOULOS Oh Q That is an authentic letter STEPHANOPOULOS Q Since the President first talked about the VAT in February he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have STEPHANOPOULOS Again I just can't comment on a proposal he hasn't Q George does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow STEPHANOPOULOS Well I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues civil Q The military issue STEPHANOPOULOS I'm certain it will come Q Is he using this event to name the AIDS STEPHANOPOULOS I don't think Q George what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa STEPHANOPOULOS He's had briefing He's had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department the Trade Representative and Q report yet STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if he has the report referred to in The Times but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him Q He was STEPHANOPOULOS Q Does he intend to use any of these instances that STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don't know that the report's been But obviously the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has Q In terms of the Wall Street Journal the thrust was that there's a real schism here a Do you think he feels that way STEPHANOPOULOS Not at As I said on the record in the article I think the President likes Again I think that the thrust of the article was still The thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent Q Can we come up to your office STEPHANOPOULOS If you're THE PRESS Thank END
