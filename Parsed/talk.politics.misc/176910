From Bill Riggs Subject Losers Was Re Stop putting down white het In article Tree of Schnopia writes In Michael Rivero writes I don't know what you as a white male I do know what white males as a class have They've invented the light bulb the automobile the airplane printing with movable type photography computers the electric anasthesia rocket powered space flight the computer electricity the telephone TV motion pictures penecillin sp telescopes nylon and the X Ray Two glaring errors First white males don't do anything as a INDIVIDUAL white males invented those things which means nothing to white males as a Second you neglected to mention Charles Manson Hitler McCarthy Jack the Ripper Ted Bundy and a whole slew of individuals who have done horrible evil If white males can take the credit for our fellow white males' boons we must also take the blame for our fellows' I claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these We are told by congresswoman Barbara Jordan that we are biologically incapable of She's full of We are told by Susan Brownmiller that we're all rapists and that's ALL we She's full of We're told by Catherine Comins that a false rape charge is actually good for She's full of We are told by the feminist lawyers that we are not to be trusted with They're full of We are told by Newsweek magazine that we are poor sports if we Newsweek is full of The point ladies and gents Michael is not entirely correct in his theory that because members of our race and gender made great advances the race and gender as a whole deserve more respect than they White males DO deserve to be treated better than they are being treated but not for that And the male bashers he quoted are repugnant hate mongers no better than the chauvinists they So no one's right as White males need to wake up and realize that they're being unfair But everyone else needs to wake up and realize that being unfair right back is disgusting racist and Why can't we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalizing What stupidity gene makes this so difficult I'd like to buy the world a The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the B word or the H word or even the N or W It is the L word LOSER That's When we boil all the crap out of this argument it is all about WINNING and LOSING and nothing Let me Remember the eighties No Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are too young to remember Ronald Reagan The eighties were about How America Learned to Win Once Again Then wouldn't you know we won so well that there was nothing left to No Cold War to No nuclear No more worlds to conquer We forgot about outer space long ago The kind of overwhelming no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Yes there were a few little problems along the way stock market meltdown here an S L bailout there a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with but as Tacitus would tell ya' the God Augustus never had it so In the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty or So there is a kinder and gentler type of politician these days Bill Clinton affirmative action and lots of discourse about people who don't get it For those of us in the winning business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no suggestion of But what do we find now To put it mildy the stereotype of our white male non winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a Hail Mary pass in the Fourth The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period But Woody just used his fists Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these Who is D FENS anyway The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS posing as a This is known as controversial But that baggy short sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't Gordon Gekko will never look the Though Woody always dressed that Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss What we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing D FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the As that arch WASP male gender George Scott declaimed Americans traditionally LOVE TO They love a winner and will not tolerate a And so The political implications are If as many socialists and Democrats do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are That could be black women today Asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say as do most conservatives and all the libertarians and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's In some cases you might say something about make sure the game is fair equality of opportunity not of condition In the latter case you might be able to identify yourself as a neoconservative or a neoliberal depending on how much you want to limit the Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from High School but you'll still be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to Even in Hollywood which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington and even in Columbus Ohio which produced Alex Keaton but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties I'd like to see more Winners in this society regardless of race gender religious preference and sexual Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl someday Bill The only proposals in the Senate that I My opinions do not represent have seen fit to mention are particularly those of my employer or praiseworthy or particularly scandalous any government It seems to me that the historian's foremost Bill Riggs duty is to ensure that virtue is remembered and to deter evil words and deeds with the fear of posterity's Tacitus Annals
