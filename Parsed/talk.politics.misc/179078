from john f carr subject re the state of justice in article russ anderson writes there's a guy on death row in texas that was denied a new trial, dispite
>evidence of his inocents. i recommend the book "adams _v_ texas", the story of a man (adams) who
was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. most of the book
is the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays
caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts. -- john carr ()
