From Matt Austern Subject Re The state of justice In article qn aINNmq senator bedfellow MIT EDU John F Carr writes I recommend the book Adams v Texas , the story of a man Adams who was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit Most of the book is the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts And I recommend the movie The Thin Blue Line , which is about the same case Not as much legal detail, but still an excellent film It shows how very easy it is to come up with seemingly conclusive evidence against someone whom you think is guilty Matthew Austern Maybe we can eventually make language a complete impediment to understanding
