From Michael Wang Subject Re Waco and Panama In article A KENNEDY JAMES SCOT writes I completely agree with you The illegal invasion of Panama was something Mr Bush never did have to answer for Remember, not only did a lot of Panamanian civilians get killed, but more than a few American soldiers died too All this for arresting a petty dictator Here's the icing on the cake to my knowledge the flow of drugs from Panama hasn't slowed down at all with the removal of Noriega So, what good did it do to remove him from power The cigarette cops and the FBI killing the Branch Davidians in Waco is equally reprehensible BTW, I've cross posted this article to t p d because I want to hear from knowledgable people on whether or not the arrest of Noriega affected the drug trade in any way The arrest of Noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the drug trade going through Panama Money laundering continues to be Panama's main industry In fact, it is bigger now than before Noriega was arrested Panama's current administration also has ties with the Colombian cocaine cartels And large amounts cocaine still flow through Panama on a regular basis Oh well Sources from the book Drugs in America by Vincent Bugliosi IRS Criminal Investigations Divison New York Times U S State Department Michael Wang
