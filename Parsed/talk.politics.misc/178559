From Ryan C Scharfy Subject Re Clinton's immunization program In article Red Herring writ es In article Jeffrey S Linder writes In article mwilson OM Mark Wilson writes On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling his so called stimulus It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free immunizations for poor Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to go have it The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents who are to stupid or to lazy to have it In case you haven't noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health care ACCESS Access here means that folks who do not give a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services delivered to their Excuse me for sticking my nose in but any parent parents who do not allready immunize their children especially if it is already free don't deserve one frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves or public health care I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are slightly seperate issues but anybody who wouldn't help their kids don't deserve my tax help ryan
