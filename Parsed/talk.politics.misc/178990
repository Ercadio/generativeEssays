From Russ Anderson Subject Re WACO burning In article A , Robert D Silverman writes In article r iiINN Matthew T Russotto writes In article C u Ev tA noose ecn purdue edu David Garrod writes B B C world news service, on short wave, originating out of London, reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, when making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene lamp and that is how the fire started Attempts were made by the people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly We're hearing it It sure rings true it's consistent in a way that mass suicide by fire is not This survivor is also saying that they It rings true There was a separate report that an overhead helicopter which was recording the entire incident on video tape has a visual record of SEVERAL files I think the number was mentioned starting at different parts of the compound Has this video been made public The FBI spokesman also said they first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out, but later said that three different FBI agents saw B D members starting the fires Also the FBI claims to have listening devices bugs in the compound Will they make public the tapes of what the B D said To me, this attempt to blame the FBI for starting the fire simply looks like an attempt by a survivor to shift blame away from the B D's I think it is a crock Well sealing the initial search warrent, keeping the media miles away, not letting the B D talk to the public, making contradictory statements, not releasing the vidio tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence in their actions Russ Anderson Disclaimer Any statements are my own and do not reflect upon my employer or anyone else c EX Twins' Jack Morris, innings pitched, runs World Series MVP
