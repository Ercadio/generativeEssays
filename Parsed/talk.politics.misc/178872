From stephen Subject Re Can't have it both ways News as enemy News as In article walsh Mark Walsh writes From article by stephen Now which is it Are you going to comdemn national media then turn around and use it to support some position you present Seems somewhat contradictory doesn't I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at The media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw undisputed One good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are There is little evidence to show that they are in I believe this true when we speak of physical data in the sense of pure But when we speak of data that revolve around social sciences then we have to be The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex events I'm sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been Cases that come to mind are the invasion of Panama the war with Iraq the disaster in Waco the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military the war on drugs and many I quite But these are cases or 'news events' that contain politics social science information sociology and at best are reflections of the group that reports As you have pointed out it is difficult to report that the temperature was degrees when it was degrees and have people believe The story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article I would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the I do however think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's analysis of this In this particular case there was little analysis and the reader was left to draw his her own Yes and The survey presented according to Cramer a value called the median which one used this makes us believe that of the males had plus sex partners and of the males had or less sex Homosexuals are purported to make up only In this case the majority of people with plus sex partners are It is my feeling that median was not the intended word But if it is then we have little evidence to support Cramer claims about gay promiscuity hetero Many netters Cramer included often forget that the American media are merely a number of businesses who's purpose in life is to make money for their owners and Revenues come largely from advertisers who merely want maximum useful exposure per The media is like fast food the quality of the food or of the reporting will improve only if the customers demand as Otherwise it is business as Very good this is a point that I have tried to bring out and as any network news program will show you it is The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties There is an old statement by a man and I cannot remember him or his statment exactly but it warns against the merger of business and news reporting because of the obvious What master is news going to serve in the The advertiser and the bias of the news
