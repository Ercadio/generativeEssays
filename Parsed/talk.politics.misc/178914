From Gary L Dare Subject Re EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance Pt II Daniel B Case writes Gary L Dare You're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one insurance No it is optional as it is optional for doctors to accept There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option I guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far I've not come across that up north and I take pains to keep tabs with news from It's optional but what if you don't want basic coverage on the government's terms You said before that if you opt out you're basically There are two things at work here the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve and as our private sector has discovered they're better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don't really need to compete because as you put it they're in a win win situation and they're guaranteed to turn a profit Believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that And according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce So in a sense they've stopped being truly capitalists if they don't have to worry about competing You might say that the total effect is one of socialized medicine a government providing the basics and a cartel providing the There is no alternative to the system desirable or The alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out doctors opted out or both But that only for insurance and you can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not And remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance Again they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay Plus there is the matter of culture and values I'm basically anti tax and anti government by Canadian standards yet I can't bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that I understand where you're coming Up north you're so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage Interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since Medicare became standard in Canada I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I no scratch that there are a few in Western Canada and quite a few in Quebec as part of the post Quebec Miracle out with the nationalism in with the French capitalism La Groupe des Cooper antes built a new tower by the Eaton 's store at Les Terraces and if you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the As for Ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north I meant new companies not new Yes primarily in Quebec and in Sorry I musta lost you in that verbose blurb It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives Well you have to realize that in our society that's like saying that it's not really national defence because you can't hire your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a True but I would be more comfortable with a system in which basic care provided by the government was optional not In Canada and Germany it's not However it is negative option in that you must request the That the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option as in the Quebec case tells me something about what they know Either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick in the light of disasters Chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease A doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty Another problem with the US system that should be Doesn't Canada have something like ten times the proportion of GPs to specialists that the US does Yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so you pretty well have to be a GP to get And if you do get the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his her appointment That we have a CMA doctors monopoly is something that the American AMA oriented medical lobby NEVER tells you down here The problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate cardiologist more than it does in general In that circumstance it's hard to blame people for going into No I respect people who do specialties okay all of my MD friends are but there's the question of our small market dynamics up north if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served and thus make some specialties finally viable there will be enough customers We just do not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers I personally think an approach like Germany's would be best where the companies compete for batches of Rochester a little east of us was able to get almost all of its population covered that Uh Germany basically uses our method with their many sickness The competition is fake if it exists at all because they're all Look in Der Spiegel or Stern my girlfriend is in our German department and her uncle is a private practicioner in Saarbrucken no ads for health While Canada organizes by province Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional But remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major German Germans have public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities actually brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system was one of the first ideas floated in Canada too Remember the Germans don't have HMO's a telling sign 'cos Rochester does and they're also a company But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs which require spinal injections and can cause seizures and Mickey Kaus in the New Republic probably spoke for most Americans when he said Who needs that I think people here generally like to believe they can easily get the most high tech treatment even if they really can't afford I'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim but I've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about our system If much or some of it were true you'd have to take us for idiots for tolerating And given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still chafing they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things think about After all we are using the as a metric to make comparison both for keeping up with the Joneses as for confirming that we did something gld Je me souviens Gary Dare gld GO Winnipeg Jets GO gld Selanne Domi Stanley
