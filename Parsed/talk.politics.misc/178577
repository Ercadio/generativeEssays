from vladimir kuznetsov subject re how many homosexuals are there in article theodore a kaldis writes >perhaps 1%, but most likely not more than 2%. a new study
>(discrediting kinsey) says so.
>-- yes, i saw today in 6 o'clock news on kcbs here in san francisco
this statistic quoted. 2.2% men had sex with another man.
1.3% cinsider themself homosexual. i understand of course that because this statistic goes against
common believe and not pc-correct it must be complete bs. thx vlad
