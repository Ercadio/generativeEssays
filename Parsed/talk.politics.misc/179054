From Clinton HQ The White House Subject CLINTON AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room EDT MYERS At we're having a press conference Bill in the East And then Saturday the President will leave here at roughly and fly down to He will spend the day there overnight at Camp On Sunday it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to He'll leave from The press plane will leave from He will meet with some Q What kind of a plane is that he's taking MYERS That he's taking He'll probably take a C Q From Hagerstown MYERS From Air Force One doesn't fly out of Hagerstown Q How will the pool travel MYERS The pool will have to meet him ahead of So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the There is currently no provision and I'll double check because there's currently no provision I think that's standard operating Q The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at Hagerstown MYERS I don't believe Q What time does he have to be in Boston MYERS He's going to meet there with a group of citizens mostly people who supported us during the campaign at around We're still working out the final Q At the airport MYERS No it will be at the Boston Harbor And then he will also meet with some a youth group that authored something called Project The speech to the publishers is actually at It will be followed by Q And then after the speech and Q A he'll attend a reception with the publishers and then return to Washington from And that's it for the Q Has the President seen the report from or the letter communication from the foreign service officers also obviously the communication from Madeleine Albright And what is his reaction to their call on him MYERS Well obviously the letter was written to Secretary I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their He believes it's an important part of the policy making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia Q What is the President's reaction MYERS The President hasn't seen the It was something that was directed towards Secretary In terms of he hasn't seen specifically the letter but in terms of their concerns generally what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now including ones that weren't there And I think he's as is everybody gravely concerned about the situation in Q Is he influenced by that I mean how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area those desk officers MYERS Many of the specialists in that area I think that that is clearly part of the It's something their views will clearly be I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered particularly from people who work closely on the Q What do you mean there are options on the table that weren't there before MYERS I think the President said last week that there were options such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims that had been previously off the table that are now being Q Dee Dee in terms of those options Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the if the Europeans did not go Is that on the table MYERS Well I can't discuss anything that would any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the But I think the President has said he would certainly is working with our European He's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus Q Will he reach a decision will he have anything specific to say today MYERS I mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy Q Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action MYERS He's continuing to consult with our allies at this He has said I think he's been fairly clear about it that the he believes that the needs to act in concert with its allies on Q On that point does he believe that the though does have built in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action MYERS Well I think the Resolution makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief I think the broader point is that anything we do any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with authority and if it's not we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get Q Dee Dee then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia MYERS I think that that's why we're considering additional I think that Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite The situation in Bosnia is The President is very concerned about He has I think President Clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world Clearly we're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's not Q In terms of what you were just talking about it sounds like Resolution justifies unilateral action by the to protect humanitarian MYERS I don't think it I wouldn't use the word It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian But I think that's just an explanation of the I think any action that we take will be consistent with resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further Q The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral action in Bosnia in the You're declining to do that this MYERS No I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on Q That doesn't mean that he won't act alone which has been said before MYERS I don't mean to imply a change in The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on Q One other little Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers MYERS I don't believe Secretary Christopher they may have had a private conversation about The President has not seen Q They met on Monday right Christopher met surely he must have brought that up MYERS Again they may have talked privately about it but Q Dee Dee what you're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected is that correct MYERS No I didn't say that at I said I won't I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or Q She's advocating unilateral action and you're saying in effect that we will not take unilateral MYERS I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have Q Given the sometimes delicate complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue does the President find this kind of letter from foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process hurtful to that MYERS I think that their views are obviously being The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views of the basis for their views to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the Q Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do MYERS I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Now no decisions have been made on that yet but I think that there is a through review underway and that their opinions are being very seriously Q If I can just follow up I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter Did he say good this bolsters my position Or did he say damn this is just what I don't need right now MYERS I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the It's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible and this I think in many ways furthers that Q So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President it's all open now and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line MYERS I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are Q Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested and what Joe Biden and others have suggested which is that the previous resolutions authorize unilateral action military action for the delivery of humanitarian MYERS I think all options are on the Q The unilateral option is on the table MYERS I think all options are on the Q We've had two different Q Isn't that a change Dee Dee Q That would be a change of Q Particularly if it includes ground troops which has been specifically ruled MYERS I think the President has been well I don't that is not Q Are you talking about all options MYERS All options I think the President has been fairly clear about So let me just review again what he has He has said that the President has said all options are on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground troops which he has never He has ruled that out from the Q Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort MYERS He has said that he doesn't believe the can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right I don't think that again I don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims things that I think we've talked about in broad This is a very complicated The options being presented and considered are very Q Air strikes on the table MYERS Again I think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being Q Dee Dee are ground troops on the MYERS No ground troops are not being Q You said there was not going to be you said you were not announcing a change of Then you said everything is on the We're Are unilateral actions on the table MYERS All I can tell you is what the President has said that he doesn't believe that he wants to act in concert with the allies on Q Wants to but he's willing to I mean if they don't go along MYERS He's continuing to consult with our allies on He's continuing to have He's continuing to press them for further And I think that's The conversation is We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on Q Dee Dee the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians MYERS I'm not sure that's the consistent I mean I'm not sure who you're referring Q The British and the Q Yes the British and They've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian Does the believe differently from that MYERS The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major as you I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as And I don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further And I think that process is Q the other day voted against any military intervention Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action The allies have been very very plain that they do not want to do MYERS The consultations are That's all I can tell you at this Q Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference MYERS No that is not the intention of the press Q What is the intention MYERS It's an opportunity to take He may have a brief I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on That will not Q Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is MYERS It's sort of a general statement of where we Q After the first hundred days you mean MYERS It's not a long I mean this is just Don't look for any major policy Q Do you know what the opening statement is MYERS But it's perhaps later today I'll be able to tell you with more certainty I think that's still under But the overriding purpose of this it's not a mystery it's not meant to It's just to take Q It would be helpful to know whether what the opening statement is MYERS Since the major purpose here is just to take questions it's not completely resolved Q Dee Dee one policy that was expected last week and that the White House you and George seemed to indicate we might get would be an AIDS Will he announce that today And what's the delay on that MYERS I don't think we meant to imply I think we said it would happen I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this It is coming I don't anticipate that happening Q What's the delay Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar MYERS I don't know that it's a I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an Q Dee Dee what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board And why wasn't her appointment announced here MYERS The qualifications I don't know if there's a specific list I'll have to check and I think there are a number of people there on the board with different Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government I think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board which is Admiral William Q Why would he appoint her though if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job MYERS I don't believe that the American people ever had voted on And I certainly she was never rejected in the She never went up there for a But the President believes she's a very competent He's said that Zoe Baird do you understand what the question is Zoe Baird is on the President's Foreign Intelligence Q You said she never went up there for a hearing Q Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws MYERS Right she never she was never but you said she was rejected by the I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Q So you don't think that is any problem MYERS I don't think there's any Q She has been appointed to this board is that a fact MYERS Q Does she need confirmation for this Does she need confirmation to be a member of the MYERS It's a presidential Q Usually announcements are made here at the White Was there a decision not to announce her publicly MYERS We didn't make an People who asked were told who the members of the board We didn't make an official If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of Q I'd like to Q Don't such board members don't you normally as a matter of routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension MYERS Not But again I'm happy to put this Q Isn't that the standard practice Q That was past MYERS Again I'm happy to put it We'll put out a list of the members of the board Q Dee Dee I don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but laughter all I really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely MYERS I think generally but not And we're happy to put that out Q What is the board what is her title what is the size of the board MYERS There is roughly a dozen members on the It is a civilian board although their are some obviously retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the Again the chairman of that board is Admiral William Q And did he recommend Baird Q What's the name of the board MYERS It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board Q What's her qualification that she had employed an illegal alien Is that laughter MYERS Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke Q Let me phrase it another Why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago MYERS Because it's Q What's her experience in foreign intelligence MYERS She's an experienced attorney someone who the President believes is very competent and And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that is not the board's It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence He believes she's very qualified very competent person enormously talented and has said that Q Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board MYERS I don't think On December when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the So I don't believe there's ever been any Q Earlier than that during the MYERS No I don't believe It was announced again on December Admiral Crowe couldn't be there but it was Q Are members paid MYERS I don't believe so but I'll double Q On another subject on Waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state I guess it's the Texas Ranger MYERS Most of the information is coming the federal information is coming from the Clearly there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into Officials in the Justice Department were told I believe the day before yesterday that there were several bodies found with bullet I think there's some discrepancy about that and the Justice Department is looking into Q Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there with some people withdrawing others saying they're in charge but others Justice FBI Texas Rangers all grabbing a piece of this MYERS I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the I mean I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about But as you know there are several levels of investigation ongoing and we're hopeful that they can work Q Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything MYERS I don't I'll have to get back to you on Q What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech MYERS It's going to be fairly I don't think it's going to be any specific I think it's going to be sort of a Q Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about MYERS We're still working on But I wouldn't look for any announcements of like the drug czar or something like Q Is it sort of a days speech sort of my excellent adventure for days MYERS Not exactly but I think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last Q Foreign domestic MYERS A little bit of both but I think a lot of Q And MYERS Yes more of an overview than a specific policy Q Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday MYERS It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Q Is that available MYERS Not yet but it will Q Are you going to put it out here or MYERS We'll probably put it out here on Q Travel next week MYERS Q What was the question Q Likely MYERS I don't Q Likely Possible MYERS Q What's possible MYERS Q George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next Do you have days yet for them MYERS Not Q Can you tell us which order MYERS Campaign finance reform first national service later in the Q Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg MYERS Q And any report in the aftermath of the day MYERS Any readout from the day Q MYERS It's Jeff Eller will be down I think he can go through what the President did during the We don't expect any photo op or anything other than departure here in the Q Dee Dee the President has not made a regular practice as some of his predecessors have of going to Camp In fact he's been there what once or twice MYERS Q Why this weekend MYERS He went two weekends ago as you know on the way home from his father in law's I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a And this is just an opportunity to do the Q There's no march Q It has nothing to do with the march here MYERS Q Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown have you thought about him making a quick pass by fly over laughter MYERS He'll fly straight to Q Flying straight did you say Q George took a question yesterday on The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear Do you have an answer on that MYERS I don' I'll THE PRESS Thank EDT
