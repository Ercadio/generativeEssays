from greg hennessy subject re why not concentrate on child molesters in article mark walsh writes really? i thought that insurance companies hired all of
#their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated
#with all groups of people, and that gays are more likely
#to have aids than are those of other sexual orientations. correlation != causality. the risk factor is having non-monogomous unprotected sex, not being
homosexual. --
