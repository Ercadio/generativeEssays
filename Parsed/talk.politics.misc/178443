From Neal Subject Re rnitedace and violence I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial and repression and should acknowledge The United States with its people have recognized that repression has taken place with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of This recognition has taken the form of the civil rights law let's just discuss the federal level for now such as USC USC seq With this recognition of repression at times manifested in the form of collective guilt I want people to recognize Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more crimes in the United States because white people are a majority it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States in their relation to their numbers in My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer in a large metropolitan area and of a Unless people account for their behavior and for the behavior of their immediate community nothing will Regards Neal
