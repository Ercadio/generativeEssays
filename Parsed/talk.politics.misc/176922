From andersom Marc Anderson Subject response Fucking news I don't think this got If it did ignore it this A response to Korey begin my response In article Korey Kruse writes writes well i just did a quick medline scan and came up with the following article by Tashkin that reviews the literature i'd probably start Document AN AU Tashkin D IN Department of Medicine University of California School of Medicine Los Angeles TI Pulmonary complications of smoked substance RF REVIEW ARTICLE Why isn't this information in the FAQ on marijuana If we expect people to think we are telling them the truth about drugs why does this group constantly refute every negative thing about almost all Maybe because the claims deserve refute The above abstract lists various possible links to cannabis use unfiltered almost guaranteed and lung Someone may get overly excited when they see that article but without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered their data it really doesn't tell you I'm going to track down that study hopefully I never claimed pot was more or less damageing than was just trying to keep ourselves If we are going to educate tell them the truth about drugs don't you think a much better approach would be to list the pro's and con's of each type of What justifies the truth about drugs Research What sort of research Correlational data can help establish a theory but it does not prove How can you expect someone to make a decision when the PDFA on one hand says that all drugs are absolutely BAD BAD this newsgroup consistently refuses to admit that drugs like heroin even have negative side Heroin is a relatively safe What makes it unsafe are IV administration and shit like There are side effects like withdrawal but they effect people I've seen numerous posts claiming heroin has lower addiction rates that cigarettes which might be true but it is very deceiving because heroin is much more harmful drug to be addicted to than Heroin addicts are far more prone to end up in the gutter and destroy their family and friends than people addicted to just Stereotypical I know people who use heroin and opiates that function just fine in This group does provide some very good information to people but I am worried that the pro legalization pro decriminalization movement is being hurt when it refuses to admit that any some drugs are VERY Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more I'm all for legalization of most drugs but when someone asks me about relative risks of certain drugs or possible bad side effects I would like to know not be given the run around by this recently tried to tell me that pot was not harmful in any manner to people's NO NO or at least I haven't been arguing this there is not enough data to form a scientific that doesn't mean that cannabis is benign to users' we can form all the theories we want but they are only some theories are supported by more evidence than others and that makes them I think it's time y'all re examined your positions and try to understand that you cannot fight the PDFA by calling them a bunch of the hell I can't they state UN JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS AS FACT as a POLITICAL strategy to stop drug In general I somewhat see what you're And people like Jack Herer contribute to This has been quite a big mind fuck for me recently and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust ANYBODY by word of mouth alone my attitude about the general population has decreased gotta run to marc
