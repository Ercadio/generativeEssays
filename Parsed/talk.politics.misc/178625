From piatt Gary Piatt Subject Re Median Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage stephen wrote The median of a distribution is that variate value which divides the distribution halfway of the distribution population have lower and half have higher variate So for Males the median this means that half of these men are higher than this and half are lower than Now if the population sample size is and of them are gay males are If we say they are distributed equally then only are greater than sexual partners of course this means that heterosexual men are greater than Not First the median does not imply that half of the men are above and half below it simply means that is the mid point between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most likely zero However assuming your implication to be more or less correct your final result is still If of all males have had more than partners and you deduct the assumed of homosexual males what remains is not but still of all heterosexual Which is to say hey we're all garison
