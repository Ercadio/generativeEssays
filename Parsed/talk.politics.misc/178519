From Phill Hallam Baker Subject Re re fillibuster In article PA David Veal writes Come to that under the original plan there wasn't meant to be anything much for the federal government to do except keep the British That's also untrue but at least we're wandering a little closer toward That the Articles of Confederation fell apart is enough proof it was there for just a tad bit Well yes and The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty wide Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock set I wasn't aware the House of Lords had wide I was under the impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons and certainly didn't have almost equal their The Senate is restricted only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until and David Llloyd George's Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping My reading of the Constitution and other writings gives me absolutely no reason to believe the Senate wasn't intended to make use of their law making In fact grid lock appears to have been designed into the system with the Senate being a more deliberative body to act as a check on the more often elected The system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up a bit too On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be some sort of rubber stamp for the House You'll note that while the President's veto may be over ridden the House can't do anything about a veto by the The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable The veto was clearly regarded as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body it is meant as a check on unrestrained That is the extra measure built into the constitution in favour of the status quo of the representatives of the states is not a reasonable
