From PA David Veal Subject Re Welcome to Police State USA In article Phill Hallam Baker writes In article VEAL VEAL David Veal writes In article Phill Hallam Baker writes Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare a private state has drifted into There are laws to control the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that they were being They set out to obtain a legal warrant and attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang the The BATF in a letter they've been sending out to people says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their It strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the Presumably the B D did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the Let's try that again Why was the BATF concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door The BATF appears to be inconsistant in their own description of And in any case how does one mount an ambush if one isn't on alert Had they expected the B D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day Phill the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for forty five I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful citizens they wouldn't have shown up in live stock trailers and would have retreated Not a smart Unless meant to be part of the surprize Even so the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good A side opening truck would have been much better more like a covered So were the BATF fired on before or after they left the trailers to knock on the door to serve the warrant Every description I've heard indicates the BATF did not hang around in the trailers once they decided to open them For that matter if they expect peaceful citizens why come in live stock trailers to being with If they were expecting peacful citizens why show up with over a hundred officers some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying sub machineguns and National Guard Helicopters Sounds just about right to Its the minimum amount of force that I would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the annual Ok just to make sure we've got this straight You consider armed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be used to serve search warrants on peaceful And just so we don't have one of those entertaining shifts you described them as the BATF expecting them to be Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over crack troops including members of the parachute regiment to remove approx hippy peace protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise He even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the Just about the most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin That single action probably cost him the position as Prime One of the elders of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Hesseltine ever after was something of a national I don't see how past abuses excuse present Hell you're not even discussing the same David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I'm beginning to think you don't love me Weird Al
