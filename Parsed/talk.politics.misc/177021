From Richard Steven Walz Subject Re How many homosexuals are there In article Mimi writes In article Douglas Meier writes In article senator William December Starr writes And what difference does it make If homosexuals should not be treated as equals with heterosexuals in the eyes of the law then it doesn't matter if they comprise an overwhelming majority of the population and if they should then it doesn't matter if numerically they're only an infinitesimal minority right And if it makes no difference then shoving a false number down my throa shouldn't be a high After all why should a minority group ne d to inflate their numbers in order to justify the rights they claim they des rve extra privileges they ask for If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault and Why must we add gay bashing to the list Isn't this a sort of double jeopardy Or am I just being a fascist again Douglas Meier This Space for Rent Northwestern University ACNS This University is too Commie Lib Pinko to have these You know I have thought about the issue of if someone beats up a homosexual or a black person should the crime be specified as something Shit beating up anybody regardless of race and sexual orientation should be a very serious If you pick out those crimes which are committed against the opposite sex different race or a different sexual orientation is this a form of favoring those groups over other I mean I think that a crime committed against all people should be treated the But I know that there are many people out there who are very prejudice against people who are different than they And perhaps hate crimes laws are the only way to punish the bastards But why should a person who commits a crime against a wealthy protestant white by a wealthy protestant white be treated on a lower Isn't this discrimination against the wealthy white Any input out there As a black person I here about all sorts of stories where fellow blacks are persecuted and beat up because of their This really tears me But a crime against a white by a white should also be treated as a heinous Please I would like to hear what other views are out Ciao' Mimi The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people being pissed off at each The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil It's the way they broke the back of the Klan by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over years It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil People who harrassed free blacks when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for to years until nobody wanted to try it Now with the amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to They can call out the national guard just for them as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 's and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms And by god they did Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the And that's why we need such an ability in federal RSW Richard STEVEn Walz Maple Street Without safe and free abortion women are Santa Cruz CA organ surrogates to unwanted Real Men would never accept organ slavery and will protect
