From Phill Hallam Baker Subject Re Waco survivors April In article Rob Strom writes In article Phill Hallam Baker writes In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder The Koresh gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue For all practical purposes they were unarmed the B D followers had automatic The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government This is simply It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as That would require them to come up with a solution Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government's handling of the Waco situation as gun supporters Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right wing gun nuts and just mixes up two I am one of the BATF FBI critics and yet I am a liberal and just as anti gun as you I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious They're all human beings not some nest of wasps that you're trying to The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his He could have been served with a search warrant He could have been arrested if he had refused to Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both Those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already unwise warrant was At this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage That's when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident Things were already building up to Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and But according to Janet Reno that option had never been seriously considered So supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style with extreeme Perhaps thats not the way to handle It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to The comparisons with the NAZIs in particular are purely Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken Peter Nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more The point is though that you learn through The govt played the wrong card and Thats not a big They had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this Who could be If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same As it is I can't say that I would not have made the same Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if I can avoid Maybee I would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access They may have calculated that the B D followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the They knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide This may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his Again in Panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's Funny that few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted to arrest their former And please let's not turn this into a pro gun anti gun Anti gun people do not believe that gun owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal but should have been legal or whatever Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police No matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it Thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to Of course we have to consider the guns That is the whole core of the Everything else is a Phill Hallam Baker
