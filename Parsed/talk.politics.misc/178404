From Gary L Dare Subject Re F O CUS HEALTH ONE PAYER SYSTEM UJSNYDER writes There is never any mention of how much working Canadians have to pay in taxes for their free health care Oh really I know that more than of an average daily worker's salary goes towards taxes in Canada mainly because of this free health It looks like we are pretty lucky so I know that when working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware that I was paying for health insurance in Toronto OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending health insurance isn't on the See our polls A better one might be the July polls conducted for Macleans our major English newsmagazine by Decima Research Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at and switching to an American all private system had support within statistical The Decima polls are considered Even the new Reform Party a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free the average Canadian European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these Personally I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada France and Germany paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's minus HMO's depends a lot on values in those societies different from the The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market but the insurance does allow the market to address that basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as Lastly there were noises about how the Canadian system was not containing costs but in fact their system is currently Please explain this one hopefully in a way that Canadian readers besides myself can understand and concur gld Je me souviens Gary Dare gld GO Winnipeg Jets GO gld Selanne Domi Stanley
