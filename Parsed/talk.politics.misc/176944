From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS The Briefing Room EDT STEPHANOPOULOS As you know the President is soon to be on his way on Amtrack to Camden He'll be throwing out the first Q It's MARC the Maryland Area Transit it's not STEPHANOPOULOS Oh it's not Amtrack Well he's going from Union Station you're Excuse Q George what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with Senate STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as We need this investment for summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this And the President continues to believe his program should be Q Will he compromise that's the question STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole let's see what they come up But the President believes his jobs program should go Q George would the President be willing to accept billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don't know what is being offered by either The Senate discussions are going on right now let's see what happens Q Would he go that far no matter what the Republicans have offered so far would he go that far billion per year STEPHANOPOULOS The President believes that his program should be passed at this Clearly we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with but I'm not going to get into figures right Let's see what Q It's reasonable to assume isn't it from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action real jobs this summer for the American I think there's no question about There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few Q So you'll need to compromise to get your package through STEPHANOPOULOS We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this Q prepared to compromise STEPHANOPOULOS The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Q Does he feel that he has been defeated in his STEPHANOPOULOS Not in the In fact he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his Q How STEPHANOPOULOS He passed his budget in record time in six weeks and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by billion over five And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding Q He can't beat this can he Q The fact is they can do that STEPHANOPOULOS Well the Republicans can stop There's no question about Q What are you going to do about it Q George what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese that when they say yes they mean no STEPHANOPOULOS I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G Q Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no STEPHANOPOULOS That's not I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G Q Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be STEPHANOPOULOS I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in It does talk about the Japanese understanding the Japanese points of I don't think it's going to be a I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not Q George was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette STEPHANOPOULOS The discussion was about Q The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes when the Japanese say yes they mean STEPHANOPOULOS Well it was a I mean I don't think that's the whole I think that the specific comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the Q Was he saying it facetiously first STEPHANOPOULOS I think it was just a casual Q And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it Has the President sent a message STEPHANOPOULOS No I don't think the President spoke I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how Q Well this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some STEPHANOPOULOS No It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no STEPHANOPOULOS reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding and I don't believe there is Q What is our position about the Japanese That they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another STEPHANOPOULOS The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the He reiterated the position the long standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G process and to play a constructive And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear Q After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days I'm a little What is the policy Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned STEPHANOPOULOS It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated and all of the officials have We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all Right now we do not have that Q throwing it out further that if Iraq complies Saddam can't stay in office STEPHANOPOULOS I think that that's our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all resolutions and we will continue to demand Q And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area STEPHANOPOULOS Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping support of Q That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with On what logic do you base that STEPHANOPOULOS Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the resolutions at He is not respecting the rights of his people as is required by the He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding Q Well when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power STEPHANOPOULOS Well right now his power rests on the repression of his If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in Q George back on the stimulus package why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock Why is it that what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith STEPHANOPOULOS Well the fact that several times in the past the Republicans many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway Q George in regards to that some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the while the plan was put together that they had one sort of proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans and that was Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some STEPHANOPOULOS Well I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one I mean the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch and went up We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's We are interested in what they have to say as But we believe that this program is important and we're going to continue to fight for Q your all or nothing do it with the Democrats alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through STEPHANOPOULOS Well I mean I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate I mean there is just no question about You only need plus one to keep plus one to keep going and to stop any action and that's what the Republicans are Q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer Q work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp STEPHANOPOULOS I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives Q But on this one how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes When you have to go through STEPHANOPOULOS I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he Q You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience STEPHANOPOULOS Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for We will continue to reach out to Republicans there's not question about And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move Q They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals STEPHANOPOULOS I think they're being Q any STEPHANOPOULOS I think their amendments are being defeated I don't know that they're being Q to present STEPHANOPOULOS That's not exactly I mean they get the votes Q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're STEPHANOPOULOS Unless they get a majority in support all the way around no that's not exactly Q George one more on Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition Grooming any new leadership Q backing any of the Iraqi leadership STEPHANOPOULOS Oh I again we're pressing for Iraqi I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming I believe there have been some contacts at some levels with Iraqi opposition I don't know about anything Q Jesse Jackson who of course is not the President's best friend has however been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the President pre empted the ball game Los Will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there STEPHANOPOULOS Well as you know the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown about days ago to be a special envoy to California and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation including the situation in Los I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education or have been visits by the Education Secretary I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to Obviously he is following the situation closely and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent But we're going to continue to watch Q George as a follow up Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today in Baltimore with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball Does the President have a position on that STEPHANOPOULOS The President has received correspondence from Reverend I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff Mack He clearly raises serious There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years but still not But the President intends to continue to go to the ball Q Is he going to say anything about it today or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if he is going to see them but as I said the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions and it's something that as I said even though there has been progress it's clearly not Q Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not sure about I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read Q George the Orioles are playing the Rangers the managing partner of the Rangers is George Is he going to be there and is he going to meet with the President STEPHANOPOULOS I don't Q What is the Mubarak schedule STEPHANOPOULOS I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a lunch and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Q And joint statements tomorrow STEPHANOPOULOS I believe so At the end Q Is there evidence George that the Egyptians did warn the about a potential terrorist bombing terrorist activities STEPHANOPOULOS As reported in The New York Times I mean I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians as there have been for a long period of We do have general intelligence sharing I But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed The President will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any Q George he did make specific or the Egyptians apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who forgive me this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at the moment and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate But there was no specific information on this specific operation at Q So the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of STEPHANOPOULOS No not at Q What's next with Serbia It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday STEPHANOPOULOS You didn't get to ask your Q Yes Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries And even if there wasn't what does the do next STEPHANOPOULOS I think the is clearly going to move forward in the today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an Q George why do you think sanctions is still an option I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace When does no mean no and you have to do something different STEPHANOPOULOS Well I mean we are doing something We're moving forward on further sanctions through the and those discussions will We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over Q Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo STEPHANOPOULOS The President has said that this is something that is under Q George do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition how he's doing STEPHANOPOULOS As far as I know nothing's Q George week after Mubarak STEPHANOPOULOS It's a little I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak Q Is he going somewhere for Easter STEPHANOPOULOS Not that I know Q What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about STEPHANOPOULOS He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G partners over the next couple of I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several Q Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not going to discuss the Q How about the list of Cold War restrictions where do you stand on that STEPHANOPOULOS As the President said yesterday he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing He believes he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list and we're going to take a hard look at Q But they're making it up I mean it's no White House involvement Congress is compiling this list STEPHANOPOULOS I think he's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll be able to get our own researchers working as Q George isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility STEPHANOPOULOS It's something that's under Q Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter of time and for months before that STEPHANOPOULOS Again all I can say is that it's something that the President is Right now we're working with our allies in the on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to review other Q George can you tell us anything about the schedule this week Any travel STEPHANOPOULOS They just asked about I don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right Q Are there consultations George with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson Vanick STEPHANOPOULOS As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe STEPHANOPOULOS as you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate
