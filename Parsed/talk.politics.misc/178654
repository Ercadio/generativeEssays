From Rob Strom Subject Re Waco survivors April In article Phill Hallam Baker writes In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder The Koresh gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue For all practical purposes they were unarmed the B D followers had automatic The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government This is simply It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as That would require them to come up with a solution Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government's handling of the Waco situation as gun supporters Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right wing gun nuts and just mixes up two I am one of the BATF FBI critics and yet I am a liberal and just as anti gun as you I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious They're all human beings not some nest of wasps that you're trying to The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his He could have been served with a search warrant He could have been arrested if he had refused to Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both Those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already unwise warrant was At this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage That's when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident Things were already building up to Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and But according to Janet Reno that option had never been seriously considered So supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the If that's so he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his But the government's hands are far from Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the The motivations for the second raid are just too And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do We have only some very biased FBI agents' word for what And please let's not turn this into a pro gun anti gun Anti gun people do not believe that gun owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal but should have been legal or whatever Rob Strom IBM Research Saw Mill River Road Box Yorktown Heights NY
