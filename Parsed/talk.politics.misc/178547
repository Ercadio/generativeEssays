From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room EDT Q Why was the postponed MYERS Just due to scheduling So as we put out the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at in the Rose Garden as opposed to The only other things on his schedule today are At he'll meet with General Vessey who as you know is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA POW At he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval And at he'll meet with the police Then from to he'll do his weekly photos with the various Q A photo op with Vessey MYERS There's no coverage on the Vessey Q Why MYERS Why It's a closed Q What about the lunch MYERS The lunch No there's no Q Is he meeting with any congress people today MYERS Nothing Q There are no meetings MYERS There are no congressional meetings today Q Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject MYERS Well clearly the report is the first order of It's high on the agenda on something that they'll I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today but the President hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report Certainly it's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about Q Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package MYERS He spoke with Senator Q How many times MYERS I believe once during the day and once last Q What was the outcome of that MYERS They're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs Q Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this MYERS Well I think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate and we'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an Q Did they discuss the VAT tax MYERS I don't know if that came Q Can you check that MYERS Q So what are they is the President offering to scale down his program is that what he's trying to do buy it down to where Dole will sign on MYERS Well he's trying to protect as much of it as he But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that we'll let you But at the moment he's continuing to consult with members of Congress including obviously Senator Q Is he talking to anybody else MYERS I don't believe he talked to any other Republicans Q Is he talking to anybody today MYERS I don't think anything is scheduled but I wouldn't rule it Q We were led to believe that the President called Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus Is that correct MYERS I think the President has contacted several people on Russian I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator The primary objective of the conversation was Russian That was the first order of business but it was Q In the President's mind are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people Has he made that argument MYERS I can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have The President is obviously committed to He liked to see a jobs package to the American people But as you know we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Q But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian to accept a vote for Russian aid MYERS I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs package and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the Q Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole MYERS He's discussing options with Q On the stimulus is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats themselves have left the support that they had earlier for the package the stimulus package MYERS I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs Q But specifically that you've lost Democrats other than Shelby MYERS I don't believe There hasn't been a Q What about Kohl Q Kohl and Feingold MYERS There hasn't been a vote And we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the Q If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day MYERS I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't Q No MYERS I'll let you draw your own Q Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today MYERS There's nothing specifically scheduled but again I wouldn't rule it Q Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today MYERS What we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by I think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this Q Will you share those with us MYERS As we did Q Do you have copies of the ones you sent MYERS Yes we made those available And we certainly can continue to provide them Q Dee Dee since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT what further consideration of this issue has been given MYERS Nothing's changed since I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on and I don't think we have anything to add to Q But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support Can you tell us MYERS I think that there has been I'm not going to speculate on who supports I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor I don't think he said he was directly contacted by Q Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this MYERS I think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently but I don't think I want to add to Q In February though the President said that this was something to be considered or years down the What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind MYERS I think as we said yesterday it is something that the working groups are looking They're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President's health care The President has not taken it up yet has not made a decision on And beyond that I don't have anything to Q You haven't answered the It wasn't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President's comments in February and George reaffirmed that in a Q And then suddenly Q What happened MYERS The working groups as we have said throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across the And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value added Q But the President himself took this off the table Dee Dee and suddenly it And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a What has happened in the meantime MYERS The President has not looked at this it hasn't been presented to him again The working groups are looking at it as they're looking at a wide variety of options and no decisions have been Q And it raises the question of how independently the task force is MYERS The task force was instructed to consider all options and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all Q But that's not the impression that the President left in The impression he left was that this was something that was long range to be looked at years down the The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table not an Q If it changes I'll tell Q Bring him Q And you repeatedly referred to the President's remarks telling us that those were still in MYERS It's changed and we told Q But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna Shalala comments were I mean that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers MYERS I wouldn't no Alice Rivlin's not a Cabinet member first of Second of all it was not orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked We confirmed that And I don't have anything to add to Q Is it because he has very few options Q Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about In other words has the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table Or is it in fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with the President MYERS It is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the President of It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context and at this point he's not that presentation has not been made but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision Q They will present it to him as one of his options though he specifically ruled it out MYERS Q Dee Dee is this more than a trial balloon Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation MYERS It's simply a statement of The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care One of the options that they're looking at is the Q Dee Dee when the working groups were examining this possibility was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not MYERS I don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options I don't Q Who was telling you that it was not under consideration MYERS I was referring back to the President's Q Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package MYERS No there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care Q I'm asking whether the projections MYERS There's a number of options depending on how the plan is You can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look And so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you Q Dee Dee we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible MYERS Q The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum That is not a very difficult MYERS It is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until there's a number of options being It depends on how the package is The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be Q And when the President has been meeting with health care his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing MYERS Q they have never once said to him these are your funding options including the VAT He has never heard the word VAT in his MYERS I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they're not daily but the quasi regular Q Well you MYERS I have not other than to say that he's not considered the And I think that is a true Q No but you said that it has not been presented to him as an MYERS Q That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about MYERS I'm not going to get into the details of what's I think that statement stands for Q specific Dee When you say he hasn't looked at it do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage or hasn't looked at it in general Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works what the advantages are the whole It sounds like MYERS But that was I think in Chilicothe if you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic But clearly it's something that he's thought about in the broad I mean that was clear in What I'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered It's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options and that no decisions have been And I'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being Q It's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken You say that no option that the option has not been presented to MYERS That is Q Do you stand by does the White House still stand by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal MYERS No decisions have been We have nothing to add to what's already been Q Let me follow up Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive MYERS I'm not going to comment any further on what might happen Q But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT I think the President said you'd exclude food and energy MYERS I'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been Q Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups MYERS I don't know specifically what Q Could you check for us because that's a real important credibility question MYERS Q Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of Were you all kept in the dark Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option MYERS I think we've said all that we have to It is something the working groups are looking The President has not made a decision about it And beyond that I have nothing to Q Well sorry Dee Dee there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here yours What we're asking is if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading MYERS I don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium ever Q Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody told anybody to come out MYERS We're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead I've said what I have to say about this Q All we were trying to find out MYERS I understand what you're trying to find out and I've given you the answers Q We're trying to find out what changed what made it an option That's the MYERS The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options and they are doing Q Yes but it wasn't an option How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table MYERS It is something that they're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision Q Yes but he took it off the table in MYERS Working groups are considering They'll present it to the President at some point and he'll make a Q Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table MYERS It's clearly on the Q Yes but he took it off the Did he change his mind MYERS It's back on the table Q Did he change his mind MYERS He said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about He obviously knows that it's on the It's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you Q So he must have changed his mind right MYERS At some point it will be looked I mean Q Dee Dee there's like two options either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the President' MYERS The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options they've done Q Are you going to put out his income tax MYERS Yes there will be something available on his income tax probably later this His return will be Q Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it MYERS No nothing's I think someone will be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you through the Q We're used to be walked line by line through the presidential tax MYERS I've seen those Q Could we have one MYERS No I don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about Q Did they file a joint form MYERS Q When did he file it MYERS I believe it's being filed Q Dee Dee is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa MYERS No there will be a readout after the Q No backgrounder today MYERS No backgrounder Q This is complicated We need MYERS We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day it's too Q Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in They've both said that A they never ruled it out and B it might be necessary Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach MYERS There's been no change in our policy towards We have always said that we'd consider Q But does that impact upon your decision Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you MYERS They're people whose opinions carry weight I mean the President supports the process that they've But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia although we're considering a number of options right If the Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options which we've been saying Q One follow up question then We cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table MYERS We're continuing to put pressure on them every Q Which doesn't work so MYERS Well we think it is having some We're going to continue to tighten As you know we support the omnibus We expect that to come to a vote on the Q You say it's having an effect can you give us any documentation MYERS I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like Q There's been no you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Serbia yes in Bosnia MYERS I think that they've had effect in Serbia and we think they've had some effect in And again I'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if you'd Q We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the Can you provide something along those lines MYERS I will see what I can get Q On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning where is that money coming from MYERS We'll have to work with Congress on the details of that Q So that would be new money that you would hope to get MYERS Yes that's new money in addition to the billion announced in So I assume that you all have seen the billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Q Isn't there a concern though about offering something which you have to get in Congress I mean that was the concern with Vancouver you didn't want to do MYERS The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal ' What we're looking at now is a little bit longer term plan to build on top of the billion that we announced in This clearly will require congressional approval or some of it will anyway and we're going to continue to work with Congress to make that Q To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress MYERS The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves Q Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress MYERS It was created in consultation with Q In meeting with the law enforcement officials is that does that have a set speech and a goal A direction MYERS Yes the President will talk about and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to Q Who are they MYERS It's members or leadership from three organizations NAPO which is the National Association of Police Organizations IBPO which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations I believe and IUPA which is the International Union of Police Q Will the FBI chief be there MYERS The FBI chief Q Or any other federal law enforcement officials MYERS No it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization Q Does the billion announced today include the million that's in the FY ' budget for disarmament MYERS The Nunn Lugar money is Q So this would be the million that's in the budget already plus another billion MYERS I believe all of this is on top of the million already in the Q Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal ' MYERS We'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism on exactly how this will be paid Q This billion on top of MYERS On top of million on top of the million Nunn Lugar money we announced Q And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole MYERS Q Is there a briefing on Miyazawa MYERS There will be a readout after the meeting with Q Dee Dee on a totally unrelated matter some Republicans who are active in the Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of There are the town hall meeting the other night the satellite and all of this Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce MYERS That's an interesting After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers now there are those who would accuse us of being too I think that's But no we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other Q What's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat MYERS It's on his I think he'll almost certainly Q All three days MYERS We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there Q Is it open to coverage MYERS No I believe the whole thing is Q Is he going to have any kind of address statement anything at all on the gay rights march on the MYERS We're still looking at We haven't made a final decision about how we'll who will make a statement or what Q Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders MYERS Nothing is scheduled but I wouldn't rule it Q What about an AIDS czar MYERS It's Q Anything on the weekend Q There's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights MYERS No I think this is something he's been discussing for a long time appearing at the Senate Democratic Q The weekend MYERS Weekend Don't know the only thing on right now is the radio address on Q Any travel plans MYERS If it changes none right Q He's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package MYERS No specific plans right Q What about mid week Anything likely MYERS It's Yes I think it's likely that we'll travel next week certainly the Q Has he called Thurmond about his daughter MYERS I don't I'll Q Going to name a drug czar this weekend MYERS This weekend I don't believe Q And the radio address on Saturday is that going to be focused on the stimulus package MYERS I'm sure it THE PRESS Thank EDT
