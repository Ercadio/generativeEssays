From Subject Re Limiting Govt was Re Employment was Re Why not In article Steve Hendricks writes These two paragraphs are from two different In splicing them together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent him in any I don't think I've done As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the tool of private interests to pursue their own It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian Just as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year X I think to become licensed as a used car In addition it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least cars at a time all the Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's Steve let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits or you would like to do it full time but these stupid arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs and you're protected from doing what you want with your Here's what I see libertarianism offering you Your money is truly yours it belongs to You can use it to buy a If you use it to buy a car it is truly your car it belongs to You can use your money to fix up that Since it is your car you can sell that Your life is truly yours it belongs to It matters not if someone thinks that it's wrong for you to buy and sell cars within months rather than say They may dissaprove but it is not their life or their money it is your life and your My money is truly mine it belongs to I can use it to buy a Perhaps your Perhaps that car the one that someone somewhere dissaproves of you selling and presumably of me That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property in the abscence of fraud or And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream but basic human decency and common A real grass roots example of freedom and And yes not having a few people acting as our masters approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human Thanks awfully Patrick
