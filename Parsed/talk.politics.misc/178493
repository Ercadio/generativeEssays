From Phill Hallam Baker Subject Re URGENT TED FRANK WANTED FOR KILLING AJ In article Mike Godwin writes In article writes But punishing the person for posting such a thing smacks of It's a deliberate act of fraud intended to cause You seem to be unclear about the legal meaning of Mere misrepresentation is not Your comment here is meant as a put It fails for several reasons You have edited out the context of the action under I never brought the legal definition I use the English language and not the legal The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any The context of the discussion is morality of How does a posting from your site do any such thing Especially if your site is a university Do you know any person who believes that a university endorses every comment made from a university site That is why I refered specifically to a Now do you know any person who believes that a company endorses every comment made from a university site You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather The mode of argument I was using was a form of Argument by example I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply thus the action is not Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed it would be contrary to the internet comercial Usenet does not distribute Organization DESYDeutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Experiment ZEUS bei HERA I suggest strongly that if you mean for this to be taken as letterhead you get a better stationery Now you are clutching at In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was The typeface etc is There are people on the net who are openly supporting the murder of members of my If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into If you are suggesting that advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of As for your notion that employees can argue their different political views at their own expense could you explain precisely what expense you're talking about Internet is not The connection charges are quite expensive for comercial Could you give me a cost breakdown for the expense to your company attributable to an employee's posting a political view in disagreement with yours Numbers That is irrelevant the case is not the incremental cost but the facility If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its For example if a Microsoft employee were to post Windows NT is crap don't buy it from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that In the same way if a company decides that it has political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his I was refering to the arrogance of your position quoting the words written by slave owners at me in the cause of Which words written by slave owners did I quote I don't recall quoting ah yes you did not quote them merely refered to Your constitution is not considered sacrosanct in other parts of the Nor have I assumed it I don't consider the First Amendment to have talismanic You might just as well have attempted to argue from the King James bible to a I was pointing out that your reasoning is parochial when with little effort you could have made a substantive I made the effort apparently you made a certain effort to misunderstand Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment your signature and pretty well damn all For an example of a UK publication that understands this try INDEX ON I used to subscribe I would still if I was not INDEX regularly publishes opinions by non Americans who believe the First Amendment represents appropriate free speech principles for all open See the opinions of the dissenting law lords in the SPYCATCHER Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be

public domain The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the You haven't any reason to believe that anything
