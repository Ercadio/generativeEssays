From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room EDT STEPHANOPOULOS I guess I'm just prepared to take questions Q George Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend STEPHANOPOULOS As you know President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active Obviously this is a tragic situation in And if the Bosnian Serbs don't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way we'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms In the meantime we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the Q How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table George STEPHANOPOULOS We're working on that right Q It's been a long Q On February the President mentioned the value added tax in And when he was asked about it later by reporters he said quote That is a radical change in the tax system of the United It's something I think we may have to look at in the years Questioned again about it later he says It is not something that is now under If we start considering it I'll tell It wasn't a trial balloon or anything he I was just discussing the tax response to a Donna Shalala quoted in USA Today this morning quote Certainly we're looking at a What's gone on Q The same with Alice Rivlin this STEPHANOPOULOS The health care task force is reviewing a number of They haven't made any decisions And as I have said from this podium time and time again we're not going to comment on decisions that haven't been Q But you have also said from this podium time and time again Q Wait a Whoa Q that that was not under Q Clinton says It is not something that is now under Is that no longer true STEPHANOPOULOS I believe the working group as Shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been made of any Q Well I But he said he'd tell us about it if it was ever under I take it that now he is and he didn't tell us about it or STEPHANOPOULOS Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed Q If we start considering I'll tell STEPHANOPOULOS If it's something to be proposed Q If we start considering it I'll tell That's a direct STEPHANOPOULOS The task force has looked at a number of different They have not made any decisions The President has not made any decisions This is one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care They have cast a very wide They have looked at hundreds of different proposals probably thousands of different But the President has not made any Q Well is the President aware of their consideration of this option STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any I don't know that that's gotten to his He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe that that's been presented to him Q Well he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of STEPHANOPOULOS No he's going through it in a very deliberate There are a number of decisions that have to be I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision making Q If this is still under consideration that's a change at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee I think about three weeks ago or She said that is not an option talking about the had a big argument with somebody over this so I remember it specifically and said it not once but Is that not the case STEPHANOPOULOS Again I don't know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task Q It was ruled it out I mean unlike other options that you've kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled STEPHANOPOULOS Again this is something that is being looked at but no decision has been made of any I mean it doesn't it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision making The working groups are looking at hundreds of different Q If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now then something has changed Yes no Q When a guy says in February STEPHANOPOULOS Well the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of Q So something's They weren't looking at it before they're looking at it STEPHANOPOULOS Well I don't know if the working groups have gotten to that point They are casting a very wide Q How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that in fact it is being considered STEPHANOPOULOS Again the working groups are looking at a wide range of They have not Q Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month STEPHANOPOULOS I don't deny that I mean those are the President's Those are very Q Subsequent to the President's words do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know about the I think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say they Q So don't they stand any longer Q March Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled STEPHANOPOULOS Well those words the President did say that in The working groups are on a separate track and as I said I don't believe Q Separate from the President STEPHANOPOULOS I don't believe this has been presented to the Q Are they considering something that the President Q Has ruled out Q has ruled out I mean will the President consider a VAT tax STEPHANOPOULOS Again the working groups have not presented this to the They have looked at a wide range of I suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly listen to That does not mean he has decided to do Q Can we put this another way In his answer in Ohio he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax Under those that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future Is that no longer the case or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging STEPHANOPOULOS I guess I'm not sure exactly what you're Q He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system not as a specific way to finance health care for Q Or anything Q Or anything Q It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax STEPHANOPOULOS Q Has that change too Q Is that still his view STEPHANOPOULOS I haven't spoken about those specific I think I can just go back to it are the working groups have they examined the possibility of a VAT Yes they Q Certainly we're looking at a VAT she STEPHANOPOULOS They have examined the possibility of a Has it been presented to the President Has he made a decision No he has Q What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the President's appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at Is the President concerned about that sort of thing STEPHANOPOULOS I think that the President's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal He's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the different If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the President will explain and But no decision has been made along those Q What does it mean exactly though when the President rules something out Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made STEPHANOPOULOS That's just that's indisputably If you but at the same time he has not ruled it He has not made a Q What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open to it before STEPHANOPOULOS He's certainly willing to listen to the Q Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short term tax this year and he wasn't willing to listen to it in Chilicothe He's now open to it STEPHANOPOULOS The context of his comments was that it was not something he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing not something he was Q Not something he was Those are his words It's not something that's now under If we start considering it I'll tell You're now acknowledging are you not that it is under consideration and STEPHANOPOULOS I'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on Q But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of STEPHANOPOULOS Obviously the working groups are looking at Again but the President has not made a Q Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know I assume that if I don't know what stage they are it in I don't know that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to I know this is something the working groups are looking Q Do you understand George that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made only about what the President is considering STEPHANOPOULOS I understand that and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a Q And the President will consider it STEPHANOPOULOS I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to Q Does that mean the President that working groups think that when the President says no he means maybe STEPHANOPOULOS I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job Q George can I ask you another question about Bosnia STEPHANOPOULOS Q No he wants us to stay on Q Let's do gays in the Q No he got out of that Q I think we've gotten the bottom line on that Reggie Bartholomew your Special Ambassador in Belgrade today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out quote We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our That seems to go a bit further than what you've just said STEPHANOPOULOS Sounds almost exactly what I just Q Well do you accept in other words you accept what Reggie STEPHANOPOULOS Well the President has said that this is something that's under It is something he will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the Q Isn't there some kind of timetable here STEPHANOPOULOS Yes there is a There's going to be a vote on the resolution in about Q That's on sanctions that's on tightening the STEPHANOPOULOS That's right that's And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the As you know Bartholomew also met with Churkin of Russia and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as Q The question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo not the STEPHANOPOULOS The next vote in the is on As far as I know there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our Q Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the would do that What was the point of his telling them that STEPHANOPOULOS Well clearly I mean this is something that's under consideration and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the They should know the consequences of failing to come to the Q Have they been given a deadline Q Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia STEPHANOPOULOS I just don't accept the premise of your It has had an effect the embargo is having an Q What effect STEPHANOPOULOS If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings then they will face the Q What effect has it had in Bosnia STEPHANOPOULOS Well the effect that it has had on the Serbians it has tightened up they are not getting their shipments We can brief more fully Q In Bosnia In Bosnia what effect has it had STEPHANOPOULOS Well it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to That is why we're continuing to press for the Serbians to But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have an I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight it clearly hasn't happened But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table we'll move forward with the Q Isn't there a working deadline George of the the same date as the the scheduled vote Hasn't the United States said along with many of the other NATO allies that if the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that we'll seek haven't we said that we will seek STEPHANOPOULOS We've said continually we're going to Q But on that deadline STEPHANOPOULOS I don't have a specific date but we're going to move forward with the resolution the resolution by around that And if that fails to take effect if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table we will clearly consider other Q Isn't this awfully incremental STEPHANOPOULOS We're taking a step by step We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to continue to do Q Is there a possibility George that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose STEPHANOPOULOS I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the We are pursuing that goal on many different We are pursuing it through the we're pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through tightening the And we will consider lifting the arms We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do Q But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained I mean once they're entrenched STEPHANOPOULOS I can't speculate on We're going to continue to press for them to come to the table We're going to continue to find ways to stop the But I can't see into the Q George on the stimulus package House Republicans say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it the less they like What's your strategy to counter that STEPHANOPOULOS The strategy we have is the one we're going to As you saw the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money the investments in We're going to point up the benefits of We're going to point up the benefits of Head We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four Q Does it concern you though that the House now the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate STEPHANOPOULOS The House Republicans voted against it They made a mistake then they're making a mistake Q George does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe as the President did this morning the summer jobs program as quote a reaffirmation of a promise of America STEPHANOPOULOS Not at I think it's the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full Q Government funded jobs STEPHANOPOULOS To give people a chance to work That is the promise of Q I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday where does summer jobs where does that figure come from STEPHANOPOULOS That is on top I did look at There are currently summer jobs in the This will be on top of the so it will be a total of Q The would be created by the stimulus package STEPHANOPOULOS Q Where does that number come from Because we've been told all along that the stimulus package would create new And according to Panetta that breaks down to something like full time jobs and summer STEPHANOPOULOS Yes but the summer that's when you do their full time I mean individuals will receive jobs this When you calculate it for the full time job effect you have to do I don't know what the exact formula Q Seven hundred thousand part time jobs STEPHANOPOULOS or Q One to four because it's three STEPHANOPOULOS Thank Q Can I follow up on that Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private for kids to work in the private sector STEPHANOPOULOS Not I mean I think that there will be grants That's one of the ways that you pay for the At the same time he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as Q Tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to work at Time Warner STEPHANOPOULOS I think the Time Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a That's going to be the bulk of There could be isolated instances though where there would be grants to Q Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week STEPHANOPOULOS No but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White Q At a lower But the President hasn't STEPHANOPOULOS The President has not Q Getting any closer to get the votes STEPHANOPOULOS We're continuing to work on Q Anybody leaning your way Q On Haiti The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup Can you confirm that there has been this change and what impact will it have on the process And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report STEPHANOPOULOS Pezzullo did brief the I can't confirm what's actually happening in the I would leave that to the negotiators But Caputo has returned to We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador And as we have said time and time again we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political Q George yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted STEPHANOPOULOS I think we have it for most states And I think we can get it Q Could you make that generally available STEPHANOPOULOS I believe we Q And could you do it by the component of the stimulus In other words STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if we can do I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other I don't know how deeply it can be broken But clearly we can break it down into summer jobs and other Q And can I follow up Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know if they're ads but they're press Q Can you describe what those press releases contain STEPHANOPOULOS All we're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various For instance I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New And I would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package creates jobs in It creates jobs in New And the people of those states should remind him that this is Q Where are the releases going STEPHANOPOULOS They go to the Q To whom STEPHANOPOULOS We can get It's no Q Can we get it Q Why don't you put them out here as well STEPHANOPOULOS I think we Q This afternoon Would that be possible STEPHANOPOULOS I'll have to I don't But as soon as we Q Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators STEPHANOPOULOS I think we're trying to get as many as we It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we're doing our We're putting them out as we get Q Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's schedule STEPHANOPOULOS I was just following Q Are press releases going along to states where he's visiting STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not I think that probably there are press releases going to Q Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting Q George as the President goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package he doesn't address what seems to be the Republicans' main point that you're funding it with deficit spending rather than if it's so important why not come up with the funding for it seems to be the Republican And how do you answer that STEPHANOPOULOS What was answer is we are paying for it over And if you look at our budget we pay for this package over We believe right now the economy needs a jump start for Q You're not claiming are you that that doesn't add to the deficit this year STEPHANOPOULOS I'm saying we're paying for it over I didn't say Q I know that But I mean from the beginning the question we do have annual budgets and things deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not STEPHANOPOULOS This year they clearly But over time our budget fully pays for this Q What you're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years STEPHANOPOULOS That's exactly what I Q I know that but there is going to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from this year STEPHANOPOULOS No we're reducing the deficit by billion billion over the next four Q You mean you're reducing it below what it would have been STEPHANOPOULOS Q In fact you're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of STEPHANOPOULOS But we're reducing it far more from what it would have That's Q Washington type Q You're getting to be a grumpy old Q George has any decision been made about the White House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half STEPHANOPOULOS We're working on the President's schedule I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that Q Will he address it by phone STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know about It's a little far out but I believe he's going to be in the Senate Q So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech STEPHANOPOULOS I don't I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these I don't know the schedule on it Q Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event STEPHANOPOULOS I'm just not Q April is Earth What is the President going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day STEPHANOPOULOS I know there's been some work on the biodiversity I don't know about signing it that day but I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around Q Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty STEPHANOPOULOS I'd have to check with Katie I just know that there's been some work done but I don't know exactly Q When is Earth Day STEPHANOPOULOS The I Q Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march STEPHANOPOULOS I said I don't know if he's going to meet or when he's going to Q Do you have a statement on the gay rights march STEPHANOPOULOS I don't actually I wouldn't be surprised if he did Q Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit STEPHANOPOULOS It's a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two Q There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G meeting and if I understand it hasn't Why is that or what's the status on that STEPHANOPOULOS The G meeting is still going on and as you know Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible But we're going to continue to consult with Congress and our G allies on Q We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two day meeting STEPHANOPOULOS The meeting's not over Q Is that when you're going to make one STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not ruling out the Q the President's going to announce it Q Bentsen said Q Yes Bentsen said it would be Q So did STEPHANOPOULOS I'd have to look at that but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Q George has there been further consideration here about going to sending the President out to Los Angeles STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know that there's it's not something we've ruled We don't have a date set for Q George you all have a position or do you support Immigration's plan to settle Iraqi prisoners in the United States STEPHANOPOULOS It's the first I've heard of Q George there was a report today about the Q Q about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it STEPHANOPOULOS We filled of the President's And it's broken down we have Schedule C noncareer SES PAS full I'm not sure what that means laughter PA full And this is about the same it's about the same pace of President Obviously as you move along farther once you each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more So we expect the process to speed But we're at the pace of Obviously we'd like to get these done as quickly as I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors and that is part of the But we're working on Q Is that because of Nannygate STEPHANOPOULOS I think that's an awful big part of it Q In the story this morning you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments but way behind in winning STEPHANOPOULOS That's where the background checks comes into That's the Q That's the background checks problem Because I mean you have a Democratic Senate STEPHANOPOULOS No that's not the you make the appointments and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks That's exactly where the problem Q What's the President doing this afternoon and what's on the plan for tomorrow STEPHANOPOULOS He's got some meetings just office meetings this afternoon for the most part on a variety of issues that probably a half dozen different And then he'll be tomorrow we'll have an event probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White And Friday is the Miyazawa Q Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow George STEPHANOPOULOS Either tomorrow or Q Is there going to be a pre briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know about tomorrow but we'll probably get something done as we usually do for these Q Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about STEPHANOPOULOS He was He met with a group of us here at the White House including Mack Q Who Q Reverend STEPHANOPOULOS Reverend Mack McLarty me Gene Sperling Bruce Reed Jeff Watson Mark Q Talking about Haiti STEPHANOPOULOS We talked about general urban He is about to go to Los He was just back from Mississippi where we had a good victory last night and he's going on to Los Q Did he request the meeting STEPHANOPOULOS Actually He's in continual contact with the He had written a letter on a variety of issues and so we asked him to come in and talk about Q George Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Have you guys been in contact with Jeffords at all on this STEPHANOPOULOS I think there's been some contact Q Can you tell us about the contacts STEPHANOPOULOS I'm not sure Q Do you know who contacted him or what was said STEPHANOPOULOS I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the Q And did he express his support for it now or is he STEPHANOPOULOS I can't divulge the details of the conversation but there have been Q The Times is reporting that abortion elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care Is this something the President is considering STEPHANOPOULOS Again Q Along with the VAT STEPHANOPOULOS It's certainly something that's been looked at but no decisions have been Q What was the question STEPHANOPOULOS The Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President's health Q Did the President in his meeting did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in STEPHANOPOULOS Well we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long term prospects for economic development and other Q For instance did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not STEPHANOPOULOS Well we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los That was certainly one of Q Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask STEPHANOPOULOS Oh Q your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments that you're just sitting by and watching a STEPHANOPOULOS Well we've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive We will continue to do Q Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise I mean we don't have any feel except talks are Have you talked to like people or STEPHANOPOULOS I don't know the We've talked to several people and we've had wide ranging Q Anyone leaning your way STEPHANOPOULOS I can't get into We're just going to keep working through THE PRESS Thank END EDT
