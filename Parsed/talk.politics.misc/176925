From Phil Ronzone Subject Re Part Re Looks like Clayton must retract In article carlos Carlos Carrion writes Does the greatly increased rates of incarceration amongst blacks show that they are dysfunctional or that the majority of them support criminal activity Isn't this a matter of demographics Doesn't this simply show that since criminal behaviour is common or apt to be common in the insert your favorite correct numbers here year old range and since the percentage of blacks in this range is higher than in other groups then it follows statistically that more blacks in prison is an expected result Note that I haven't said anything about blacks being given stiffer or longer sentences than other I'm sure this has to have an effect on the issue of over representation of blacks in Blacks have the same crime report rate arrest rate and incarceration rate for violent So I doubt that for violent crimes that there is any inherent bias mechanism There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to Interestingly enough the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States Which points to an anti bias against wrt In any case for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling blacks are reported arrested and are present in jails prisons Considering that of the population is black are black males and some percentage of that is out of the high low age groups we do have a situation where if I remember my old calculations right of the population commits almost half of the really nasty Blacks with similar histories crime to whites get the same sentences except in the South where they receive around less on paper There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental Weird eh These opinions are MINE and you can't have 'em But I'll rent 'em cheap
