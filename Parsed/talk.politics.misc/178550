From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON Remarks to Law Enforcement Leaders THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS The Rose Garden EDT THE PRESIDENT Good Ladies and gentlemen two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the American people their jobs and their economic The federal budget plan passed Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the Then the short term jobs plan I presented to Congress which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the House of Representatives two weeks It now has the support of a majority of the United States All of these members of Congress know it's time to get the economy moving again to get job growth going again to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting Unfortunately a minority of the members of the United States Senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs When Congress returns I ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at The issue is not politics it's Sixteen million of them are looking for full time jobs and can't find These men and women don't care about who's up or down in They care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a They're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy I am prepared to do And I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs I'm willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on jobs keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national Our opponents have been asking for a smaller Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the American But even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller I believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of Americans and one in particular and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent So I will ask even in this reduced package for an additional million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national Together with a matching effort by local governments this could put as many as police officers back on the job and back on the beat in communities all across our At a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments America can And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create Make no mistake about it I will fight for these priorities as hard as I ever I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs their future and for fundamental I want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police They came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the And I want them to be free to talk about They came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful I say what I say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these I have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to It reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same These are the kinds of things that we are trying to I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put another police officers on the street over the next four This makes a good downpayment on This keeps in mind the core of the jobs And this will help us to move So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the jobs bill let's work I can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe I do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our I have done my part now to end the gridlock I ask you to do I want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the American people beginning with Janet Reno the distinguished Attorney Q President can you tell us do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional dialogue THE PRESIDENT Not at I think it should have they wouldn't have any relationship one to the First of all I made absolutely no decision on You should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this But I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general Q Do you personally believe that the American public is ready to pay for to have another tax to pay for health care I mean apart from what business and labor leaders have said THE PRESIDENT I'm not going to speculate on I will say this The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the I mean that is everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over utilize or over provide certain services if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care The real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the I have no The polls say that but I don't All I know is the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an affordable health care But I don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus and it certainly shouldn't People want a job first and They want that more than anything Q Now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable I assume summer jobs is THE PRESIDENT I want the summer jobs I want the highway program and I want the police I still intend let me say this I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which did not pass the Congress last This is a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any But I think we need to do I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with And there are several other things that I think should be We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors the safety of the public depends on There are a number of other things that I don't I don't think any of it should be cut but I have given Senator Mitchell and Senator Byrd I talked to And Senator Dole called me yesterday to discuss this and I told him that I would call him I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we discussed And I basically asked them to talk today and said that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been already and let's see if they can talk it Q When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell did you tell them about your increase also that million that you want that as part of the package THE PRESIDENT I did I told Senator I left word for Senator Mitchell last night about When I talked to Senator Dole I don't remember for sure I do not believe I mentioned But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock and I told him that I was working on a reformulation of it so that in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to And this is certainly consistent with Thank EDT
