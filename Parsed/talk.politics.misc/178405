From Clinton HQ Clinton Gore ' Subject CLINTON President's Radio Interview in Pittsburgh THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary Pittsburgh Pennsylvania For Immediate Release April INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF KDKA AM RADIO PITTSBURGH Pittsburgh International Airport Pittsburgh Pennsylvania EDT Q For everyone listening on KDKA Radio I'm Mike Whitely KDKA Radio We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to THE PRESIDENT Thank you Glad to be Q There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have but some news is just breaking from Los I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police We just heard that two of those officers the sergeant Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty and two officers have been found not It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to THE PRESIDENT Well first of all I think the American people should know that this trial in my judgment is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one the standards of proof are The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows and another officer who was a No one knows exactly why they did what they did but it appears that they really tried to do justice They acknowledged that his civil rights were And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things first of all the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American secondly the importance of renewing our fight against I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country people may be worried about police abuse but they're even more worried about It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing put more police officers on the street pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically distressed If you just think about it if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary Ron Brown to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate which could then be applied around the I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General to the new head of the NAACP to Reverend Jackson and to several other people and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the Q Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area There have been I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus You've been locked in a battle with the Yesterday as you said earlier in your radio address you made some moves to break that What brings you to Pittsburgh in particular to Allegheny County in particular to Pennsylvania with that battle THE PRESIDENT Well there are two First of all Pittsburgh Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic We have passed our overall economic plan it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous We reduced the deficit and at the same time increased investment in jobs and education and health care in the things that will make us a stronger But in addition to that I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money a modest amount of money to create another half million jobs in the next year and a half to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector The plan passed the It has the support of a majority of the At the present time all the Republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the That is they won't let it come to a I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the And I believe that Senator Dole the Republican leader has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay And they're all saying that this bill increases the It doesn' This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved including the Republicans for this This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five This bill is designed to give a jump start to the And I must say a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up when Bush was President voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind much of it was totally unrelated to creating So what I'm trying to do is to break this I've held out an olive branch I've offered a But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the And that's the purpose of the Q Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately THE PRESIDENT Well we've been trying to talk regularly to through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this Senator Specter Senator D'Amato from New York Senator Jeffords from Vermont Senator Hatfield from Oregon and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I You know it has a lot of appeal to say well we've got a big deficit we shouldn't increase it But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few And more importantly we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this And they've done this for years with the Republicans voting for it many Republicans voting for it for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to So I just hope that this doesn't become a political It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for Q I have some questions from people who supported you and some people who are skeptical about your It has to do with their hopes and also with their A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania I think some of them are now saying we're glad we got him in the White House but now look at this incredible process he has to go Look at these Look at this And they're beginning to wonder is this going to work can you pull it off And of course your skeptics are saying well I knew it was going to be like THE PRESIDENT Well what I would I'd ask people first of all to remember that we are frankly moving very The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution ever in history setting out the next five year budget So we are moving really And we've got them working on political reform welfare reform health care reform a whole wide range of But it's a big You can't expect to turn it around It took years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November and we can't turn it around in But I think we're making real real I would urge the people not to get We're not going to win every battle and not everything is going to happen But we are definitely moving and changing Q Thank you very The President of the United States Bill Clinton here live at Pittsburgh International I'm Mike Whitely KDKA EDT
