From William Edward Woody Subject Re Top Ten Signs That It's the Age of Aquarius on Pennsylvania Avenue In article Amar Chaudhary writes Hey I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 's esque touch AAAAAAAAAAAA RUN RUN FOR YOUR LIVES Look Canada Europe and Japan manage to provide health care for their citizens and yes basic health IS a human right which people are entitled to If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you then I guess we've found something better than capitalism There is nothing sacred about the capitalist system and if something be it socialism or anything else works better then I say let capitalism Then why are they in the process of systematically dismantling some of their socialistic health care systems through privitization of key components Make love not War If I hold a gun to your wife would you respond the same way I don't think While the age of aquarius may have hit the White House the age of peace love and harmony hasn't hit in South Central LA nor has it hit in former And as long as there are people in the world who would rather see me dead than thrive I want the protection of a police force who will keep the peace so I can make love without being Contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist at the same To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force them into some sort of tradition role is even Women certainly have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of the past few centuries seem like reform I look forward to The ultimate statement for equal rights something many of the feminazis have forgotten is I do not care if you are either a man or a woman I do not care if you are black or white I do not care if you are gay or Once you can honistly say I do not care about color race or gender or sexual preference then we will truly be on the right Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along Get real So long as you try to make me care if you are black female or whatever I am going to continue to It's natural human But the moment employers searching for employees banks looking to lend money and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say I do not care about your color race gender or sexual preferences I instend instead to treat you as a human being crap like last year's riots will continue to HEY MAN ACADAMIA RULES You mean the same economic theorists who say things like for the sake of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is no wealth creation now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in real life Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic Look in the first chapter of that book introducing the field of macroeconomic Right there in chapter section is a statement like the following As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently the province of individuals who create new inventions and discover new ideas we will assume for the rest of this book that there is no wealth We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently unpredictable subject is Even though we assume no wealth creation we do believe that for most mathematical economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid as it allows us to make predictions which then can be So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not They are borrowing an idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide too advanced to think of these simple To be honist I would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same Bill Woody Normally I don't post or even read most of the postings in this If you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply then I guess you will just have to reply directly to
