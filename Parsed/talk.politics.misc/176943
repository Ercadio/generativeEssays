From garrett Subject Re Losers Was Re Stop putting down white het In article Bill Riggs In article Tree of Schnopia writes In Michael Rivero writes I don't know what you as a white male I do know what white males as a class have They've invented the light bulb the automobile the airplane printing with movable type photography computers the electric anasthesia rocket powered space flight the computer electricity the telephone TV motion pictures penecillin sp telescopes nylon and the X Ray Two glaring errors First white males don't do anything as a INDIVIDUAL white males invented those things which means nothing to white males as a Second you neglected to mention Charles Manson Hitler McCarthy Jack the Ripper Ted Bundy and a whole slew of individuals who have done horrible evil If white males can take the credit for our fellow white males' boons we must also take the blame for our fellows' I claim we deserve neither credit nor blame for these White males need to wake up and realize that they're being unfair But everyone else needs to wake up and realize that being unfair right back is disgusting racist and Why can't we learn to treat everyone fairly without generalizing What stupidity gene makes this so difficult I'd like to buy the world a The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the B word or the H word or even the N or W It is the L word LOSER That's When we boil all the crap out of this argument it is all about WINNING and LOSING and nothing Let me In the meantime there is guilt for winning maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty or So there is a kinder and gentler type of politician these days Bill Clinton affirmative action and lots of discourse about people who don't get it For those of us in the winning business this kind of talk is mildly irritating but there is still no suggestion of Who is D FENS anyway The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS posing as a This is known as controversial But that baggy short sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't Gordon Gekko will never look the Though Woody always dressed that Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe without putting up a fuss What we are starting to lose sight of is that bashing D FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the As that arch WASP male gender George Scott declaimed Americans traditionally LOVE TO They love a winner and will not tolerate a And so Since we are talking in theory and opinion then I'll put in my First a Personally I love under Unlike bandwagon jumpers I abandon teams when they start People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something The political implications are If as many socialists and Democrats do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are That could be black women today Asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that On this one point I The reason that people bash WASP's is because they have been on top for a long Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better worse than the whites The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the But they only did what any other conquering race would have done Khan The real question is should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes Would it do any good Has it done Bosnia any good They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds even thousands of years My opinion is if there are inequities now then let's change But don't blame me for what my ancestors It wouldn't settle anything Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from High School but you'll still be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to That's where you are dead You don't join up on a side just because they are That makes you Winning in high school and after high school is still the best way to be popular but it doesn't make you All the best causes in history were loosing causes with only a couple exceptions Winning only makes a difference to other people not to And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear a Winner If you can't beat them fight them every inch of the Bill At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's Garrett Johnson His eyes turned inside His feet began to leak out Garrett of the top of his The room folded flat around him spun around shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own Douglas Adams
