From VEAL David Veal Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Car In article Richard Wojcik writes In article VEAL David Veal writes In article Richard Wojcik writes Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and Vancouver The non gun rates were roughly the same for both The difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun And as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques of it two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost entirely minority That is the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities Blacks and Hispanics primarily while when you compared the white majority they were virutally Many of the people who never read the NEJM article believe that this critique is In fact the study explores the minority issue at length and cites studies to back up its contention that poverty not minority type is the relevant factor in violence Perhaps I failed to make myself clear Minorities in the correlate with This isn't good and we should address it but we shouldnt' ignore that minorities and poverty do tend to go Does Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along racial lines If it doesn't then assumptions of being able to compare minority majority in both cities is questionable at Post hoc ergo propter Those areas implemented gun control because of the high True only to a certain Take Washington where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that crime proceeded to explode Similarly for New Actually I don't know whether any serious studies have been done for both Usenet style statistical arguments are not very serious usually involving people sitting by computers with the latest World Almanac I had heard of a study on Washington DC that seemed to indicate a significant drop in gun related violence there after the laws were I heard Gary Kleck comment on the radio that he thought the decline in suicide rates was related to the new laws but he doubted their affect on other gun related I have never seen a report on the study nor have any of my pro gun friends had much to say about that Remember you can't just say that crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime You don't know whether the rate of increase would have been different without the If the rate of increase over a period of several years remains unchanged or increases I think it's not a far jump to say that the laws are not No you can't sit down and say that things wouldn't have been I don't have a crystal ball and neither do However that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique any If it gets down to be It might have been worse without them then there is no valid objection which I'm sure would amuse certain people to no You don't know whether the laws prevented a threefold increase or failed to stop a two fold So we've got a situation where we have several options The crime rate decreased Obviously gun control The crime rate remained the same It would have been worse without gun The crime rate increased Perhaps the laws prevented an even bigger Cute testing ground we've All responses support the proposition that gun control The question is this Did Washington experiance an increase in its violent and or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control If it did then the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to control did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control David Veal of of Education Services Group PA I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I'm beginning to think you don't love me Weird Al
