take it one step further If as the surveys show up to of all men have had a homosexual encounter then there must Cite a survey other than the obviously bogus Kinsey Pomeroy Bell Weinberg National Institute of Mental Health Paper ''Patterns of Adjusment in Deviant '' Cited as part of the National Institute of Mental Health Task Force on Pomery concluded The Kinsey statistic of is probably higher than is According to these estimates is a more realistic I went out and bought LOTS of Bell Weinberg this can you tell Also The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior Samuel Janus and Cynthia Janus John Wiley Sons pub has the following Table Have you ever had a homosexual experience N Yes No Table How often have you had homosexual contact Men Women N Once Occasionally Frequently Ongoing Active of is This number is consistent with Kinsey Pomery Gebard Bell Weinberg and Rice in the finding that of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown Bell Wienberg of exclusively so and self identifying themselves as pp As for debunking Kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert by Philip Nobile Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a secret sex criminal a Hoosier Mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin cultural His bestselling surveys Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female tore the sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury His charts and graphs based on detailed histories of men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and or 'abnormal' masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as American as strawberry Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character Judith Reisman the prosecution's expert witness at the Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati is the leader of the anti Kinsey revisionists as well as his Inspector In during a radio interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington Reisman accused Kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm Now seven years later Reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled Kinsey Sex and Fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette Her coauthor is Ed Eichel a Manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the In the book Eichel contends that Kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the 'denormalization' of If the authors are right then the world famous Kinsey Reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this And if they are wrong Kinsey Sex and Fraud is a shameful Despite the less than stellar credentials of Kinsey's detractors legends are not what they used to Martin Luther King may have committed Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental patients Father Bruce Ritter the founder of Covenant House preyed on runaway Closer to Kinsey Masters and Johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the As a thinker the woman is no Madame The year old former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peer review publications though her creative resume was padded with phantom For instance it listed a book as her own Take Back the Night Women on Pornography that was actually written and edited by Then there is her in Speech Communication from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve Although Reisman has no bachelor's degree Case granted her a master's in and a doctorate in Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian TV But on the resume Reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker to wit The Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program it was love at first sight for Al Regnery the outwardly anti porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's Justice Regnery was a young law and order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the United After Reisman's sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech Regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual First he tried to shovel her for a quasi Frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal but in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B a probe of child images in the cartoons Playboy Penthouse and Hust Incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general's pornography When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice That spring Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the Notwithstanding the six figure humiliation Reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony As the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men's magazines and blames AIDS on Kinsey Sex and Fraud is Reisman's latest grasp for Pat Buchanan of course is putting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate This book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front He especially liked the antigay Smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared It may just blow the sewer cap off Kinsey's monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Kinsey's ' ' The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who molested little boys in Nazi type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume A similar charge was first recited at the Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in to no effect before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in Kinsey Sex and Fraud Mengele like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children were the basis for Kinsey's on childhood Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project Kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost This of course would implicate Kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal In the opinion of this book's authors that is exactly how part of Kinsey's child sexuality research took Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on child molesters as a guide Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as Reisman said Kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as camp counselor boys' club leader and Boy Scout leader activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his As crude as his analysis seems Eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone If you've ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he Everything in his life is directed at getting I didn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high school picture was a quote from Hamlet 'Man delights me not no sic nor woman ' What do you think they were picking up on Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of Kinsey's sex crimes something must be said about Kinsey's scientific modus He was a fiendish As a young zoologist with a from Harvard he collected million gall wasps and million related When he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in he was no less curious or Nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to He compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral Naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their And so with the fervor of his bughunting days Kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until Reisman and Eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them Some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our Although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure There was nothing like it in the Kinsey's main source a year old govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever This man whose history took hours to log had sex with over boys and girls as well as of family members including his father and A sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper he gave Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent Relying on the man's meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as years Kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality Kinsey had reported as Children were indeed erotic beings from the These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in Then along came Judith Ignorng the legitimacy of Kinsey's inquiry she beheld the ghost of Mengele in She was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex Well was he or wasn't he Let's go to the There is no evidence in Kinsey Sex and Fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates Kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex After years on the trail Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge amazingly enough Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy Kinsey's coauthor on both reports to whom Reisman has never It turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in Pomeroy's biography titled Kinsey and the Institute for Sex After frisking every the and and in both books Reisman came up with what she believes are smoking To establish Kinsey's alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey directed the orgasm studies on She cites his tell tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that their empirical study and statistical Then she combines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was Putting two and two together Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her But realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal As for the alleged participation after poring over Pomeroy's biography Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting Kinsey's likely hands on approach to kiddie Here the chain of reasoning is more She points out that Kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex Reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to Kinsey's child sex Catch the may Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits Kinsey according to Pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female Because he had not personally witnessed this event Kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished How then did Kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a month old infant from the mere 'history' of a sex offender But of course he did not he depended on their From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax in cottontail has Reisman defamed the legendary Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey Institute and now lives in retirement outside Reached by telephone Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied Reisman's nasty I don't understand the resistance of people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children Gebhard said more in exasperation than That is where sex We were happy to take data wherever we found Even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent They wouldn't be very successful if they One of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former As for directing experiments that's We never told any of our subjects what to lt was against our Almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective Nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children That would have been highly I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and Kinsey watched As for Kinsey's sex life it is still shrouded in He was married to the same woman for years and fathered four Apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the Gebhard took his boss's history back in the ' but he refuses to discuss what he We never divulge anything about anybody's history whether dead or alive he Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that I had once worked for Penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five In keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the Kinsey practice of euphemizing My offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a article on the subject of As a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in Ed Eichel is a different Though seemingly obsessed by Kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long He told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the early ' It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he Around Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised Eventually Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman and from this union Kinsey Sex and Fraud was Eichel's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of cross generational sex sex with children When I pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly You don't think Kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the Kinsey Meanwhile Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of Kinsey and his That's just what the country needs a House Un American Sexual Activities Committee looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader a sympathizer or God forbid a subject of Alfred Elf Elf Sternberg The purpose of writing is to inflate weak
