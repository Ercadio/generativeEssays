From Steve Hendricks Subject Re Price Controls for Medical Care WAS Re We're from the In article writes In article Steve Hendricks writes Thanks to Kim for following I was hoping that someone would bring up the issue of cost The problem with the argument is that it fails to explain why kidney dialysis RD services have expanded massively in the last After all no one is forcing private providers to offer this If they are losing money on the treatment which according to information I've collected from several providers they are not why would they not simply limit their losses by cutting back on services engage in effective rationing of supply rather than expand the coverage to a larger market that must then be compensated by raising prices in other areas Perhaps there is a competitive advantage in there after Would not reputable and dedicated physicians prefer to affiliate with an institution that offers dialysis services Would they not therefore tend to admit patients in greater numbers to an institution that offered a full range of diagnostic and treatment options In fact it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that in part complicates and undermines a simplistic free market analysis of the market for medical Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high tech high price They manage to make it up on other Once again there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients RD is still a profitable Otherwise one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has Remember the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an array of products at prices below cost Are not grocery stores embedded in a relatively free market Can you spell loss leader I knew you Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of In fact your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be But the evidence does not support this Rather it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower cost technology to provide comparable Providers continue to profit from RD they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free market advocates would have been seen restriction of service lagging technological development Likewise it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems where providers are government agencies some of these negative impacts may RD patients in the VA system in Spokane for example must travel to Seattle miles away for The bottom line however is that this is an example of government intervention of a rather extreme sort that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and Claims that government bureaucracy inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into jsh Mark Steve Hendricks DOMAIN steveh One thing about data it sure does cut UUCP uunet isc br thor steveh the bulls Hofferbert Ma Bell
