From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Bases loaded walk gives Reds win in In article Mark Singer writes In article Edward Ted Fischer writes Here we go You started For predicting the future it has been entirely At least if it has meaning we don't know how to find I did not say I could predict the You most certainly did Non Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Sabo Samuel Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Yet you would pinch hit Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and Sabo will be a choke Right I'd call that predicting the future If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch hitting I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized prior You just wouldn't have used this particular aspect of prior Is this not correct I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the Overall performance L R splits even matching hitting pitching All of these will give me some advantage if used EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch And in this case everything else pointed to One more I did not claim to be able to predict the I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than That comes down to the same When Perez left Sabo in he was predicting the future the next He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than By supporting the swap you are predicting the And I am not dismissing your I'm stating my You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your Well You are aware of its You claim to be incapable of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling Yet you rather forcefully state the You don't seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important I'd say this is I did not say that it is a consistent I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of RIGHT This is the It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any At least none that we've been able to come up If you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your It is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived Most As I have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability I would love it However the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed Hindsight is always Doesn't that make you bright This is a stupid argument and you know I knew we could get to the name And there's that word you like so Well it was a stupid Are you honestly debating that Sure we know Sabo didn't get a We have no idea whether Samuel would have done any better or One AB most certainly doesn't prove anything I believe that by season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch I can't prove that it will happen so I guess we'll just have to wait and Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year Or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall If you mean the first then as you say we'll just have to wait and But the second is a much stronger In fact it suggests a We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent I think you will agree that if the rule didn't work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this Right Here's another one for In Joe Carter's batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each I presume you think this is I'm not going to get into case Sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from ' ' and then hit poorly in ' as You can also find those who hit poorly from ' ' and then hit well in ' No this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league It just makes me think that in Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch Gambler's Unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to correlate from one year to the next I've seen a detailed study of why I shouldn't expect it to Stupid Total idiot My Such The stupid was in reference to a statement which was And I don't see how you can deny As for total idiot If you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits So tell me Does the term fit Or do you have an open mind Valentine
