From Doug Roberts Subject Re Neon Deon Sanders Braves Giants In article A kenton yee writes phisto gatech edu Thomas Miller writes Does anyone else think that this weekend's four game series was a really strange one yup, I was wondering the whole time why the Braves most talented outfielder, Neon Deon, was not starting Here's Whoa Aren't you forgetting a couple of guys named Gant and Justice a guy who can hit , hrs, lead off, and steal He can lead off He'll probably steal He might hit He'll never hit homers I think you went for on this one bases and they start guys like Nixon and Bream ahead of him I can't really see that advantage of Nixon over Deon except that Nixon is a better defensive outfielder You said it all right there Does anyone else out there not like Deon I think he's all hype His season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do it again It reminds me sorry of the year when Tim Wallach hit or so homers and had RBI It never even came close to happening again Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business and don't play it up for the attention Just my HO Doug Roberts Larry Walker is God Delino Deshields thinks he is John Bratt, if you're out there, send me some email My system can't find your site
