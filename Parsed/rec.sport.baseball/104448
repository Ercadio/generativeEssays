From Douglas Fowler Subject dimensional teams was Re Royals final run In a previous article Sean Sweda says I've been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL team since the inception of the DH any ideas what this is They will fall easily short of runs that's for damn I can't believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of genius for the trades aquisitions he's made Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in ' or ' True Cone is probably as good as Drysdale and they have no Koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of low scoring games And they didn't use relievers whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for That being said I still picked them or so but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough There's more of a chance of that I think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no At least to I wonder though which one do you people think would do better a team with Johnson Koufax in his prime Seaver Carlton and Young in no real order as the starters with Sutter Fingers and Lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like Mazeroski Maranville Or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of Cobb Carew Ruth Gehrig Mays Schmidt Wagner and Bench again you pick the I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' Even the best hitters can succeed only of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts taking all the players in their prime they might throw shutouts in a And all the offense would have to do is get run I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results I would love to see Doug Fowler Me age now Mommys and Daddys other Ever wonder if after Casey relatives have to give lots of hugs love missed the strike in the poem support 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it big hug that lasts forever and ever
