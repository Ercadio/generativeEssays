From Dodger Subject Gross Grosses Out Dodger Fans Went to the Dodgers game tonight it was cap Astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all In the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw Another single made the score Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler Reed And Piazza batting third Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Piazza homered in the first to make the score The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by By the fourth inning Astacio had already made about pitches but the score was still The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base Karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at My heart sank in the when Gross got up to warm up in the Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when Gross entered the game with the score still Dodger fans just KNEW it was Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday pitching just innings forcing Lasorda to use much of his The inning game had the same effect the next only Gross was fresh given his light work out Gross lived up to his He walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases After a grounder resulted in a force at home Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it Gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the Cards had stolen a fourth The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the run had scored long before Meanwhile the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second Lee Smith pitched the He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger a single but that was all the offense the Dodgers could Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at If Piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year Though its really early Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx The final runs on Dodgers runs on Dodger
