From Steve Tomassi Subject DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean heck if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long Big Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so Save them for the guys who really deserve Face it if something isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates the absurdity is Gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan Steve
