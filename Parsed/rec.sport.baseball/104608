From Mark Singer Subject Darrrrrrrrryl The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death but I haven't seen anything in rsb Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a He stroked a line drive into the right field The ball cleared the three foot high fence and went into the Darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the A fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the Home Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl' Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with What cannot be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious to where the fielder was He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the That exuberance disappeared immediately however when Strawberry went into a tirade at the All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the Dodgers a Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another In an interview after the game Lasorda blamed the fan for the Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of Was the fan wrong Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference Or was he human and just reacting By the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of rbi through the first nine I question what he was doing in right center with a left handed pull hitter up and the game on the Had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the The Beastmaster Mark Singer
