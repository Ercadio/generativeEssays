From Dave 'Almost Cursed the Jays' Kirsch Subject Re Young Catchers In article Mark Singer writes At age Alomar had a brilliant rookie True he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite This season the same Bill James projects a ba of OPS of The same Bill James Why do you say that It sounds like you're suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to Au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign noting that he wasn't all world as a catcher or a He called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in The reports I read indicate that Lopez is very ordinary Which reports are those The Dodgers options are Parrish and Hernandez and now only Piazza is As long as he continues with his very hot bat they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive When he cools off look for the much better defensive catcher Hernandez only to play I like Hernandez a lot but if Piazza can catch the ball you've gotta play him He's a much better hitter although Hernandez isn't a bad Right now it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the As long as they play up to their abilities the Dodgers could have a very good catching The Braves options are Berryhill and I agree that Olson is nothing special but I do think Berryhill is better than many people on rsb But both the Braves' catchers are very good defensively calling a game blocking the plate throwing and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big I think both are overrated defensively see Nichols' Law of catcher defense but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold Catchers ERA is a possibility but it's subject to way too many As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat' I disagree here About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions CF C SS if Belliard plays unless Bream and Hunter form another super platoon and very weak defensively if Blauser I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot but much like the talent rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they I'm not saying that's wrong just Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch Blue Jays Do it again in ' New quotes out of context Not to beat a dead horse but it's been a couple o' weeks this disappoints Stephen Lawrence
