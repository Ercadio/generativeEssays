From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Jack Morris In article senator Charles M Kozierok writes the only really valid retort to Valentine is weren't the Red Sox trying to get Morris too oh sure they said Viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say Lou wanted Morris all The Giving the man million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the safety The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it And don't tell me Boston will win this They won't even be in the top in the division more like if this is true it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares I don't see why people expect Boston to finish The bottom four teams last year were essentially Boston in seventh place had The Yankees and Indians tied for fourth place had Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Basically the Red Sox are stronger this year at DH SS LF and They have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better I see no reason why they shouldn't win Meanwhile the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers still have no They will win some blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of games MAYBE the Sox will play poorly win games and finish But I think third or fourth place is more Cheers Valentine
