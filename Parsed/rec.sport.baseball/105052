From Barry Walker Subject Re Jack Morris In article A SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes Where did Acker get a ring from I would have to say that they are about even I believe Acker got a ring from his wife when they were married the Blue Jays had such a strong offense Don't tell me that Morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris The stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best this year is another case , he just happened to win games I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good games But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the th innings the clutch innings and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him Another major factor in his wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win games i believe this is the major reason he won games last year Barry Walker BNR Ottawa Canada My opinions
