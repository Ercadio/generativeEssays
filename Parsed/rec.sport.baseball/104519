From Neal Traven Subject Re Braves Pitching UpdateDIR Dave Naehring wrote In article Sherri Nichols writes Every single piece of evidence we can find points to Major League Baseball being offense A run scored is just as important as a run This certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what percent is fielding I'd really like to BTW Sherri thanks for the DA data I find it One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled 'Pitching is of Baseball ' implying that fielding is How do they determine that Beats me it's been a long long time since I read One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around and neal traven You're only young once but you can be immature Larry Andersen
