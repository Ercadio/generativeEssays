From Dale Stephenson Subject Re Braves Update In Sherri Nichols writes In article Eric Roush writes that HE'D been thrown And Gant had a legitimate beef about the pitch that was called a A reasonable umpire would not have tried to FORCE Gant back into the box in that A reasonable umpire would do as he's been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of I for one am glad to see this happen and hope more umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter won't get back in the While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around Gant wasn't ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back As soon as he stepped out Hirschbeck told him to get back in the Now Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between The only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the I expect his concentration wasn't there yet and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the Braves long scoring Now it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in You know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out Gant was But Hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the Gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call Gant hadn't been wasting time all The game had been cruising along and was just over two hours The score was with outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring Is there any reason Hirschbeck couldn't and shouldn't cut Gant a little slack For no discernible constructive reason Hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key Did he have a date to get to And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the Dale Stephenson Baseball fanatic It is considered good to look wise especially when not overburdened with information Golden Kimball
