From Douglas Fowler Subject Re Jack Morris In a previous article Edward Ted Fischer says In article Phill Louis writes Jack Morris' starts have been like his playoff He has an ERA of in his What does luck have to do with a ERA He was lucky to get wins last year but he had an ERA of with a team that scored a lot of I would be happy if he could still pitch with an ERA of but he seems to be suffering from a total Bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good They are closer to the chasm of The smallest push and they completely lose their But good ones can collapse somewhat then come back the next Burleigh Grimes went from wins and an ERA of or so in ' to and an ERA around in ' He pitched well for several more Carlton won and lost the year after his Source Bill James Historical Baseball And let's not forget John Tudor who started and finished in He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the He gave up early runs in his ' games and would get stronger as the game went on thus giving up few runs in the last He stays in the game and gets the How else would he have pitched so many innings He used to dig himself a hole then get it together and stick in until the run support eventually came This year he just hasn't gotten it If I recall he had a ERA in the half and a ERA in the half of last Hmmm runs in Suppose he starts more games and winds up w innings If he allows runs a game in the next innings he'll have a ERA or so at the end of the I think I have his totals This is going to be hard to come back Jack may be It is time to retire or be released if he does not return to his form from last His million contract is an awful lot to eat My hunch is that Morris is very gutsy and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling My guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL Or will Danny Cox who went or scoreless innings against the Tribe today start for Morris He looks like a really good Gaston is scrambling to find starters I'd Luckily the Jays have a very good I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Doug Fowler Me age now Mommys and Daddys other Ever wonder if after Casey relatives have to give lots of hugs love missed the strike in the poem support 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it big hug that lasts forever and ever
