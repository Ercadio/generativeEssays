From dxf po CWRU Edu Douglas Fowler Subject Re Jack Morris In a previous article, Edward Ted Fischer says In article qr cINN Phill St Louis writes Jack Morris' starts have been like his playoff starts He has an ERA of in his starts What does luck have to do with a ERA He was lucky to get wins last year, but he had an ERA of with a team that scored a lot of runs I would be happy if he could still pitch with an ERA of , but he seems to be suffering from a total callapse Bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good pitchers They are closer to the chasm of mediocrity The smallest push and they completely lose their grip But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year Burleigh Grimes went from wins and an ERA of or so in ' to and an ERA around in ' He pitched well for several more years Carlton won and lost the year after his record Source Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract And let's not forget John Tudor, who started and finished in He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season He gave up early runs in his ' games and would get stronger as the game went on, thus giving up few runs in the last going He stays in the game and gets the win How else would he have pitched so many innings Yup He used to dig himself a hole, then get it together and stick in until the run support eventually came through This year he just hasn't gotten it together If I recall, he had a ERA in the st half and a ERA in the nd half of last year Hmmm, runs in innings Suppose he starts more games, and winds up w innings pitched If he allows runs a game in the next innings, he'll have a ERA or so at the end of the year I think I have his totals right This is going to be hard to come back from Jack may be finished It is time to retire or be released, if he does not return to his form from last year His million contract is an awful lot to eat My st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone My nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL Or will Danny Cox, who went or scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris He looks like a really good one Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox Doug Fowler dxf po CWRU edu Me, age now Mommys and Daddys other Ever wonder if, after Casey relatives have to give lots of hugs love missed the rd strike in the poem support, 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it big hug that lasts forever and ever
