From Mark Singer Subject Re Bases loaded walk gives Reds win in In article Harold Brooks writes In article Mark Singer writes I don't pretend to understand statistical Well we agree on the last And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name calling of One of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to A player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help Actually I think the large scale sample size is part of the It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell The X axis being the deviation in clutch hitting non clutch the Y axis being the number of Certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the My supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players As a counterexample to what you showed consider the following two players from Non Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Maldonado Lemon If you had had these two players in by your logic in those clutch situations you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an Well in Maldonado hit in non clutch and in clutch while Lemon hit in non clutch and in clutch Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data You won't hear those kind of accusations from It is interesting that you selected Maldonado because he is someone whom I have also looked He has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of BA hitting in Admittedly he has been traded between leagues as well as His clutch hitting record is equally So for my purposes in I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior I don't know how I would have felt in but you may indeed be When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non clutch Ditto for Joe This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity Is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base BTW correlating players' overall batting average from ' ' with ' gives a correlation coefficient of which is significant at something better than the confidence Correlating their clutch non clutch BA for the same period gives a correlation of significant at no level of any I completely accept that Again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis Actually it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future clutch It's more correct to say that we can't predict future clutch performance with any The Beastmaster Mark Singer
