From Mark Singer Subject Re Pleasant Yankee Surprises In article A Edward Ted Fischer writes In article A Michael Lurie The Liberalizer writes I'd be willing to make two wagers Snow doesn't win ROY Mattingly is out of baseball within five years I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a player, and he is on a losing team I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance of ROY's come from winning teams In fact, I think team performance is generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins Am I wrong And he is not necessarily on a losing team While the Angels' staff is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank you Snow is playing great Salmon is learning to make the adjustments Easley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner Polonia and Curtis are steady and heady Even Myers and Orton are contributing Personally, I think they can finish over which makes them a winning team The Beastmaster I'm skeptical of the second because of his back Mattingly is this year, and how many players play until they are Not too many, and most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to bet Cheers, Valentine Mark Singer
