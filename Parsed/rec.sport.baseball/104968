From dietz Kent Dietz Subject Bosox go down in smoke II Seattle Oh yea and Chris Bosio pitched a NO One over the minimum two bases on ball in the first inning one runner left I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus but that Fairly guy is really annoying me But I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching it would have been a different story Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in Major League baseball Pretty impressive in any Man if Johnson Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this Also John Cummings rookie has had three solid outings with no If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year relief is another story though grimace Too The first no hitter that I have been able to follow from start to And again I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the The guy is truly a joy to listen to he deserves a pennant race Kent Dietz Twins in ' Mariners If only they were an NL team Follow
