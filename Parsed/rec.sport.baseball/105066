From RVESTERM vma cc nd edu Subject Re Yankee Thoughts In article A , Sam Mandelbaum says Yes Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction They should finish over this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August However, I would take back a few moves The Jim Abbott Trade bleagh this was a terrific trade snow will certainly be better than mattingly in the future, but that they'll be about the same now is a defensible opinion abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in the game today Wade Boggs i'm not sure about this one i think that it's good, in that a pre boggs kicks hayes meulens whoevers' ass, and that a boggs still isn't ALL that shabby it's bad, though, that the yankees expect a pre boggs, and will probably get a boggs however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam Spike Owen you have my full agreement here he's not all that much better than velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him however, i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname not that this helps the yankees Danny Tartabull i strongly disagree i'd much much rather have a hundred games of tartabull and sixty games of dion james than games of james bob vesterman
