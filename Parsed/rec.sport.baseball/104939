From Chuq Von Rospach Subject Re Why is Barry Bonds not batting punjabi sanjeev punjabi writes Some evidence that is NOT working Take a look at the It's REAL easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first If it's working you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things just because you think it ought to be Some folks like to argue about theoretical I prefer to watch teams When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to re arrange the batting Until then I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best first baseman in the majors and that Matt Williams is a better power hitter than any other ballplayer In the majors I don't follow AL so I won't comment on Majors In the NL if I had my choice of any in the league for my team it'd be Clark and I'd hit him My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it because I've never been able to GET I'd take any of the three without hesitation in real life but I think Clark is it Williams Not even I much prefer his defense but when he isn't headcasing it Matt has a good solid swing and some real If he drops to then he wanders out of cleanup but according to the latest Baseball Weekly he's hitting and in the last week hitting That's not exactly chopped Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues it's rather silly to second guess their But evidently some folks would rather be right than be Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support Training DAL AUX Member SFWA Editor OtherRealms GEnie ALink CHUQ Minor League fans San Jose Giants A San Francisco Giants fans The Stick NOT San Jose Sharks fans New seat TBD
