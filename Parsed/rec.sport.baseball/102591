From Douglas Fowler Subject ATAS games standings of all Philadelphia at Chicago Teams tied for after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game One Friday one Saturday and a good old Sunday What could be better declared Ernie Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging It's pitching it's always been pitching that we've lacked announced Ryne If we can get by Brewer then beat Carlton Alexander or Bunning preferrably of the last three we'll know we might be able to Lord I hope we pull it The Phils scored once in the top of the first Richie Ashburn singled Pete Rose followed with a hit sending Ashburn around Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at Rose went to second on the Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving Pete Rose to Schmidt was walked the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw walks this Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in right Cool Papa Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from Nellie Fox was walked and Bob Boone grounded out to second ending the Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti and that is lowering their run It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their The picthers have slumped at So came the analysis from Frank The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit Thomas' grounder moved him to second and after Sandberg made out Billy Williams singled home a In the sixth Ron Santo launched a two run homer to make it Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to Allen doubled to right but luckily for the Cubs Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at Lance Parrish hitting for Boone was walked and Bruce Sutter Larry Bowa grounded into a double play but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch Desiring a strikeout since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch running at third Chance brought in Lee Smith who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the The Cubs took the win moving a game behind the Steve Carlton was called upon to battle Finger Brown To get another righthander in the lineup Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played Unfortunately Brown allowed six doubles and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs and Cuyler added another and the score was Cubs after six The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the Cubs grabbed more runs to ice an Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off Robin Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest but the Cubs captured the second one with Waddell gaining the Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders and would conclude their series with the Expos on Montreal at Louis August way tie for Dennis Martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus John Tudor The Expos have a wide variety of hitters and while they aren't among the all time greats they are getting the job After winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only games out of first in this wacky Martinez triumphed on Friday and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean However the Cardinals refused to give up winning on The Cards captured Monday's game too as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked Lou I don't see why we can't win this The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for Two thirds of the way through the season there is a way tie for New York at Pittsburgh August straight wins for Bucs now back but in When your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this spoke Gil Hodges before the Keith Hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra The Pirates have made only errors all season ahead of the second place Error totals tend to be around for the best defensive All Time Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez Friday and Candelaria outshone Seaver Saturday in a game featuring some outstanding When Nolan Ryan and two relivers hit the Mets in another win Sunday the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the They had been unable to several times in the past Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two run blast by Ralph Kiner for the The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco working his second inning after Mookie Wilson pinch ran for Gary Carter at With one out and a runner on first Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at He slid hard into Honus Wagner preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the Tekulve allowed a hit but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to The Pirates had scored an improbable straight wins and had moved to within games of first place with seven weeks to San Francisco at Boswaukta August Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't In fact reported manager John McGraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a man rotation again for a little Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday beating Lew Burdette and the Braves Willie Mays had all four on Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a The Braves' park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the Giants won a seesaw affair Willie Mays had three homers Willie McCovey Eddie Matthews and Don Baylor had two and Hank Aaron Ernie Lombardi Biz Mackey and Mel Ott had one The Braves had collected home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader putting them on a pace for which would be short of the National League They were still a tad behind the ' Yankees' They had allowed over Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring batters in the He allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the Joe McGinnity earned the In the doubleheader the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won The Giants took the second game however by a The homer by Aaron was a magical by the Braves however they fell to three game below making a comeback extremely San Diego at Cincinnati Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this game series and the Padres felt rather With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game the trade looked even McGriff's batting average was even Of course the bench was very poor and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding Jones pitched a good game Friday and won McGriff launched two home Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday was the final Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a tie through eight innings before The game was scoreless for more innings until the Paige had departed after and John Franco hurled a scoreless Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched Thurm Munson doubled both runners home and the Padres gamed a The three game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Though the Reds denied it the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of Brookangeles at Houston August Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game opposite Don Normally Drysdale remarked I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at I can't afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we can't afford to let the Astros beat He then winked and said Well maybe Davis will get decked The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the The hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and Still Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park they have a foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home The foul poles are feet from home plate but the alleys are feet away with center field at It's as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates 'If I can't hit home runs nobody will hit home runs' remarked Roy The Dodgers stole five bases Friday but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed weeks before for tonight anyway Davis Jim Wynn and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a He responded with a two run double but Wynn playing first for Davis popped up and the Astros didn't score any more in that They did score in the fourth to erase a deficit and the Astros wound up winning They threatened to do even better the next game as Tommy John would be their Walt Alston met privately with the starters at before the I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop he How can we do that Pee Wee Reese They're going to be beating the ball down so we've got to be ready to throw on the Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole The plan almost Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the Astros got three two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and Astros was the final with Dave Smith earning another The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday as Nolan Ryan walked five three of whom scored in a Dodger Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game to Don Sutton however as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be We're mostly a power team remarked Ron Jackie and when he plays Maury Wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and We're sunk in a place like the I guess that's why they're so successful Indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the The 'Stros swiped bases in attempts giving them on the Standings after these weekend series Team W L GB New York Cleveland Detroit Boston Baltimore
