From Sherri Nichols Subject Re OBP hurt by sac flies was Re HBP BB BIG CAT In article scott mclure writes Sorry I gotta disagree Last time I played ball I went up on several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the runner from third or advance a runner to It's relatively easy you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to hit a good line With fastballs it's very easy much more difficult with good breaking A good hitter with excellent bat control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least oh of the time Maybe There's a blurb in the STATS Scoreboard about this and though I don't have the book with me here my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were far below this Sherri Nichols
