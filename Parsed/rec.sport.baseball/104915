From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Source Picks Baerga Over Alomar Case Closed In article Bruce Klopfenstein writes fester Mike Fester writes I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right T P rated Baerga higher Finally an objective Alomar's a great player but so is Nice to see the objective source cited rather than my dad's bigger than your dad I You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar to Baerga must be a Jay Lover and Indian Sorry you got that one wrong I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about the But objectively Alomar had the better offensive year last year so I have to pick You admit T P as a reliable objective source Then you will note that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player chosing Baerga over Alomar only because of his That's a joke Alomar might not be a gold glover but he's certainly no worse than Baerga Valentine
