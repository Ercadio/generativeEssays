From HEALEY Subject Re HBP BB BIG CAT The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal Apr that Rockies won I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH He stands more erect and very open with his left foot pointing to I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him Andres had one glaring weakness as a He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and If this is indeed a new stance for him maybe he is not being fooled as easily As for his patience Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good If he was grooving pitches to Andres you can hardly fault him for drilling them which he did Does Andres generally start hot or cold Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away Roger Healey
