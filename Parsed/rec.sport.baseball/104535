From Scot Hughes Subject Re I hate to mention Acker In article Bruce M Hasch writes In article Paul Andresen I feel as if I might be causing some bad karma by doing this but I just have to Is the Ack man still in organized baseball Glad you asked The Ack man and nine of his relatives are currently impersonating the Baltimore Orioles pitching Personally I believe that the Evil Ackers kidnapped the real O's staff and are currently in the process of impersonating Mussina Sutcliffe McDonald No no The Ack man is apparently an alien life form much like the pod people from planet Mars who can take on any form the ability remains the same however The Ack people have been spotted on many teams to date but it appears that the Orioles staff mentioned above and the Expos bullpen Barnes Walton Fassero Gardiner and Rojas have been the prime Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover and has been on the DL ever Contact the authorities This evil plot must be stopped the Ack people can keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman I enjoy watching Toronto fans suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal Scot Hughes Department of Chemical Engineering Expos in ' McGill University Montreal Quebec witty saying here
