From Andrew Wyllie Subject Re Jays' Darrin Jackson is a nightmare In article Eric Klinker writes In article Thomas Hyer IOR writes In article Eric Klinker says DJ was a popular player in San Diego Derek Bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at Toronto so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team I laugh at you now and I will laugh at you again equally publicly when the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their The Jays will finish third because of the depletion of their pitching staff NOT because Derek Bell was traded for Darrin I couldn't agree The Jays have a lot of power in their line So far pitching has been the biggest Maybe we can get Acker back But anyway the point of my post if you missed it was that Derek Bell was traded because he was basically in the doghouse with Cito and the rest of the One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were back in the Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air waving a big towel over his He looked like a big jerk especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole The next day Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's Bell really freaked I don't think Bell was to popular after I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right He's known for being a great outfielder and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been booting balls and playing generally andrew Andrew Wyllie MRCS University Of Toronto
