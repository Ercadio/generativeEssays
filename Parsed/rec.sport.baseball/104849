From choman Charles Stanley Homan Subject RBI Question Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI's This is the situation that brought the question up The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the by a score of The Mariners had the bases loaded with The batter hits a fly to center which the fielder The runner at third tags and scores without a Now without a judgement call and I don't think there is one this is an RBI for the It seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive indifference since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that I know I can think of several If the Mariners stole third and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third he wouldn't have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out scenarios But does it really matter if this guy scores this way when you're down by If the tying run is going to score so is the guy on The point is that the batter IMO shouldn't get credit an RBI for utterly failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one What do you guys think Regards Burke Charles Homan Go Red Sox Go Rocket
