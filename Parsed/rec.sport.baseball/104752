From Gary Built Like Villanueva Huckabay Subject Ron Gant Stalling and Dale Seer Stephenson writes While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around Gant wasn't ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back As soon as he stepped out Hirschbeck told him to get back in the Now Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between The only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the I expect his concentration wasn't there yet and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the Braves long scoring And it is not Hirschbeck's job to help Gant with any of these If Gant can't gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes him all the more meat in the batter's The umpire's job is to maintain flow of Gant is not entitled to time to regather his Nor is anyone Now it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in You know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out Gant was I think it'd be more accurate to say Gant was But Hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the Gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last about nine fifteen weeks if Jack Morris or Dave Whiner Stieb were A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time Suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the They're not going to change their mind and you're just going to come across as a pinhead which won't help you with the borderline FTR I never speak to umpires when I don't know them personally nor do I glance at them or react to As a result I think I get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because I have a rep of having a good Actually there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about my masculinity party affiliation and sexual Gant hadn't been wasting time all The game had been cruising along and was just over two hours He was wasting time The score was with outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring Is there any reason Hirschbeck couldn't and shouldn't cut Gant a little slack Because it's not his Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily extend to those hour Kind of like the phantom For no discernible constructive reason Hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key Did he have a date to get to Gant hurt himself and the Braves disrupted the Your biases are exposed and I'm sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants which is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura Jack Kevorkian and the Swedish Abortion And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the I believe Terry said the magic There are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a For a primer email Good ways to get tossed from a game Ask Ken Kaiser if he got his money back from Nutri Kiss Rich Garcia on the lips and say Hi Honey I'm Home Goose Eric Ask Bruce Froemming if his parents had any children that Get Source The Greg Spira Book of Diamond Ettiquette as told to Peter Collier Gary Huckabay Outside That was right down the bleedin' pipe Balder than any Kenny I realize I don't have great control but Dave on the c'mon Gary that was a styrofoam The plate's a foot to your Throw the
