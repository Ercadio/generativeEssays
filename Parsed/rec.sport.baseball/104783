From Richard Trionfo Subject Re WFAN I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP I go to school in Philadelphia and I listen to both stations on a consistant Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent Morning show In my opinion I think Imus is much better than Bruno Cataldi and Morganti even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work To me WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a In terms of sports Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his AM to Noon I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major I would consider this even because they are two different styles of Noon to PM At this point I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of I just think JM has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the Philadelphia fan This is most evident when the IGGLES Philadelphia spelling play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas Where else can you have people call up and predict a score without the egging of the hosts re WIP morning 'guys' I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good If you are in NY and you can't get WIP JM does fill in on the weekends to This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo fatso and froot loops and I become the most divided in my Mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even to minutes without talking about MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the to Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning which are often PM to PM MATD go up against Fredericks and I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve I know that SF came from Philly originally but when he was at the FAN he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer I don't listen to WIP much after PM unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the That is why I give the advantage to PM to Midnight S M are on WIP until and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism G This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go I know that is biased but listen to his show On FAN there is usually a game on Knicks Rangers Mets Jets or John's If the game is on the west coast then it is usually Howie Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the If this is the sports station why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP home of Howard Stern in During the summer it is all talk on Overall I would have to give the advantage to WFAN with the exception of to and to where it is even and to where WIP has the Rich You've read the hat now see the Imus in the morning A blurb You're a blurb Seinfeld
