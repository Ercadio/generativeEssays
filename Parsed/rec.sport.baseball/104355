From Richard Detweiler Subject Re Torre The worst manager From another not so distressed but still wondering about a few things Cardinal fan In article Brian Landmann writes Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in He's not the greatest this is For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game I saw With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right Lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told Torre he could pinch hit if they needed him Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea a hitter with no power as a pinch What the Hell is he I wondered the same But giving Joe the benefit of the doubt I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run Alicea I was completely confused Maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher I don't Anybody got an idea Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the Gilkey hit over last year what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every team in the Well so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play Jordan ahead of That I don't quite Furthermore in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home Yup I looked for this on the replay If I'm Joe Torre I'm going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that He's got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe a hot hitter coming up there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the It's his job to watch the play develop he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad That seemed inexcusable in my BTW I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical On the replay there's Dent waving him It looks like this might be a serious The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base I can't take this anymore Well I'm still hanging in GO REDBIRDS WOOF WOOF brian a very distressed cardinal Brian Landmann Georgia Institute of Technology Internet Dick Detweiler
