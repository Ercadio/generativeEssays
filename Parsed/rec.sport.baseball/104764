From Mark Singer Subject Re Game Length was Re Braves Update In article Michael Zimmers writes In article writes writes I agree with What's the big deal about long games If you want to watch baseball there's that much more baseball to And yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL Last year I hardly watched a What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the A team minutes of minutes of Three downs and a minutes of AAAAARRRRGH Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's whom I believe institutionalize slow I don't mind the cat and mouse game with Rickey on first in fact I rather enjoy Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first or when the game is a I don't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every When a game is exciting these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the When the delays happen with regularity they become nuisances just like the commercial breaks in I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to speed up the games basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots That did not address the problem of the continuity of the It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the Similary while some hour baseball games bore me to tears those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each I doubt if anyone watching the Braves Giants game cared about Gant stepping I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of On the other hand I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson LaRussa Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they I sure wouldn't mind a little arm twisting The Beastmaster Mark Singer
