From Greg Woods Subject Re HBP BB BIG CAT In article dtate David Tate writes Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarraga's inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he isn't paid to walk or is an RBI guy or Alright that's I've suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a Galarraga is currently batting over and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing enough What would he have to do to please you guys bat You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen THEN I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough My comment that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs it's more along the lines of he's batting and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks Greg
