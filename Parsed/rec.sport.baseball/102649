From Subject Re My Belated Predictions NL In article mssC zyo JsC netcom com , Mark Singer writes In article A Bob Gajarsky Hobokenite writes i've said the braves would improve by injury as well here's how javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson ryan klasko is a better firstbaseman than bream chipper jones is a better shortstop than anyone the braves put out there mel nieves is better than nixon sanders that's how it FORCES them to play the young guys bob gaj I continue to be amazed at these comments While Lopez might some day be a better catcher than Olson, I find it totally amazing for you to suggest that this year old with three seasons of professional baseball is now better than Olson, a five year MLB veteran who is noted for his ability to call a game, and who has a better than average arm Oh, perhaps you are talking about hitting Well, sure, Lopez might hit better Perhaps he probably will But has there ever in the history of baseball been a year old or younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league catchers in terms of defense and brought a bat Wasn't it Yes, Ivan Rodriguez, last year Batted and threw out of the baserunners Not too shabby for a rookie from AA years old last year Sandy Alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year Not Wasn't it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year Not I can continue this thread with the others mentioned, but you get the point You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies Perhaps just perhaps the management team of the pennant winning Braves knows something more than you do And perhaps what they know is that very, very few and year old rookies come up to the majors and make an impact The Beastmaster Mark Singer Roy F Cabaniss Wait till Tommy meets the Lord and Western Kentucky University finds out that He's wearing pinstripes All opinions contained herein Gaylord Perry talking about Lasorda Are all mine own, and that's the sin Baseball, what a way to spend a day
