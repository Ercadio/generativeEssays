From Gail Fullman Subject Re PHILLIES SIGN MARK DAVIS Does that mean they have to pay his salary Didn't they wait for him to clear waivers If not why not Davis will be paid by three clubs this year I think the Phils are responsbible for about or They didn't wait for him to clear waivers as three other clubs were also very interested in A gamble Oh it will As a Royals fan I am They say he pitched well in winter He also pitched well at Omaha while with He just didn't pitch well or even acceptably when in the I don't have his Atlanta stats but he must not have impressed them very much What about the year when he got saves in San Diego did he pitch well then Ok I know he was awful the next year when he went to KC but Won the CY Young too for that
