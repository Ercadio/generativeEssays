From Ryan Robbins IO MAINE MAINE EDU Subject Re Game Length was Re Braves Update Umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's or hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time The batter has seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch I'm against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down seconds between pitches and the minute for warm ups But I think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch The same goes for pitchers Umps should tell them to pitch or feint within seconds or a ball will be called That's the way it should be Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine IO Maine Maine Edu
