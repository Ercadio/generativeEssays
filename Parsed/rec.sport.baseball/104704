From David Barrington Subject Red Sox Choke Contest To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism I am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current You must decide first whether the Sox will be at again at any time during this Then you must predict either Their record the first time they're at if they are or Their final record if they stay above the rest of the So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as resend it if you were serious Val ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in when they finished in sixth So email me your guess either at or directly replying to this Entries close pm PDT on Wed Apr Dave MB
