From roger crux Princeton EDU Roger Lustig Subject Re Sandberg, Runs, RBIs was Re Notes on Jays vs Indians Series In article C JqBy M A news rich bnr ca bratt crchh a NoSubdomain NoDomain John Bratt writes In article C JM M J , Gord Niguma writes Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT of RBI's and anyways how many nd place hitters have you known to drive in runs Doesn't happen that often very unlikely with Devon White's OBP in front of you I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once I know someone will correct me if I'm wrong RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics You can talk about OBP and SLG all you want, but the fact remains The team that scores more runs wins the game Right So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM gets more runs If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but doesn't score them all himself, who cares Consider Player A single Player B grounder to short reaches on the force at nd Player C Double, B to rd Player D Sac fly B gets a run, D gets an RBI Are you sure they helped the team more than A and C Think hard, now Flame Away As you wish Roger
