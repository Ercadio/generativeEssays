From Mike Jones Subject Re Jack Morris Roger Maynard writes In Edward Ted Fischer writes In article SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes Hey Valentine I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their So Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his He certainly didn't earn his last HOW many games did he blow in the World Series All of the ones he started He certainly did earn it He was a valuable member of the Blue Jay Not particularly in the World During the season he was probably more valuable than say putting Olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them In the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a The Jays won in spite of Morris much more than because of Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best Oh Therefore Morris is better than Your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning WS Umm Roger Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster Valentine was replying to used of WS rings as a measure of The concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it The facts are that Morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning Clemens hasn' Unless this transaltes to Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for You can go on about what Clemens has done in the past and claim that he is better than Morris if you want But the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens hasn' What on earth does this mean Over their careers Clemens has won of the games he's started Morris Per year Clemens has averaged nearly wins Morris just under Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game If so then consider that Clemens allows runs innings Morris allows nearly a run more per nine In fact Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career But I forget in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in had Morris been on the Sox it would have been a routine groundout right Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally The object of the game is not to compile high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are The object of the game is to contribute to WS But this has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp Speaking of stupid it has been patiently and not so patiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a Don't give me that If Boston had Alomar Olerud Henke and Ward while Toronto had Rivera Jack Clark Jeff Reardon things would have looked a little different last Give credit where credit is This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me Yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit about what didn't happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and see what is REALLY Forget about how Morris shouldn't have won with an ERA over When Morris pitched last year the Jays Stop crying about it and get on with No one is crying the Jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL They performed well in two short series and won the World Series and I congratulate them for As a Red Sox fan I hope they keep I was happy when they picked up Stewart and elated when they traded for Darrin You see unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got Luck runs out just like it did in when he pitched odd more innings than gave up exactly one earned run more than in and went Seriously Roger I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the Morris and the Which one was a better pitcher and why Did Morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years If so then why did he go in with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than Mike Jones AIX High End Development Don't be humble you're not that
