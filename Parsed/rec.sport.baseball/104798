from jeffery brown subject re early bbddd returns in article writes just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the
>bb ddd this year.... the tater that jack morris served to griffey the younger in his first
at-bat this year went 394 feet, if i remember right (i'll have to check
my scorecard at home). i think that's the longest so far in the kingdome
through the first stand (five games) there. a weak showing, despite some
promising taterball candidates ... ben mcdonald, rich delucia, and the
rest of the mariner bullpen ... making appearances. anyone have the tape-measure value for omar vizquel's grand slam in the
skydome?
