From Gerald Olchowy Subject Re Jays' Darrin Jackson is a nightmare In article A Jay Chu writes Jackson is a bum And I thought the Jays were smart to get rid of Gruber Now we get equally bad I'm frustrated Pat Gillick is over rated Sure, he did some good moves in the past, but releasing Wells although his temper sucks, but he's better than Morris Stewart Dayley If the Jays were dumping salaries to keep mill Jackson, Dayley should be the one to go before Wells Of course they dumped Dayley, but it's too late since Dayley's salary was guarenteed with Wells the Jays were only on the hook for of it Give Jackson a break he lost about pounds with that flu he had when he was traded Wells was already claimed by the Tigers ERA with wins Also, the Jimmy Key and Winfield situations pissed the hell outta me Would you see a championship club wanting to repeat so badly wanted to have such a I would rather have Molitor than Winfield Winfield was just hogging all the credit, and he was trying to soak the Jays for a year guarenteed contract great turnover No way Look at the Pittsburg Penguins They got some aging players, but didn't make stupid trades to dump them cuz the fans love those players and they are still the core of the team Anyways, I just want to say that if the Jays go BELOW this season, I won't be surprised I'm not jumping off the bandwagon, I'm just talking smart baseball No matter what, I'm still going to see most of the Jays games even though I'm damn frustrated The Jays pitching can only get better Molitor and Alomar haven't hit anything yet and the Jays are still over Gerald
