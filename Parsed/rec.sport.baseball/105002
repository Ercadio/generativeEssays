From fester Mike Fester Subject Re White and black racism was about the In article niepornt David Marc Nieporent writes In article Dennis G Parslow writes To beat a dead horse I seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for some black fringe player named Roberto And for Roy And for Thurman And for just about anyone else who we may not even have liked as players but mourned for dying too Wiggins Alan I believe he was well out of baseball by the time he But that's besides the I'm sure people would feel slightly sympathetic for Rickey if he were But they would also be criticizing him a lot more for his Example How about Jose Canseco He gets a couple of speeding tickets and all of the sudden his attitude is What the hell do speeding tickets have to do with clubhouse influence anyway So why do sportswriters talk about it all the Uh he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car and smashing it into a tree as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his And the speeding reported was over mph reckless Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell Both of whom had DWI problems towards the end of last Two years ago It was cited as a sign of their immaturity Actually I hadn't heard about this Meanwhile Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton and I didn't read any sportswriter complaining about They may have talked about how bad it was for the Phillies but I NEVER read anywhere criticism of Dykstra's character or Daulton's intelligence for that matter based on this I don't know what you were reading or watching but I sure saw a LOT about that and about Dykstra's poker Most of the writing was along the lines of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was and how he'd hurt the team by wracking himself and the catcher up ESPN raised questions about his judgement The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra and one article pointed out that if Lenny wanted to kill himself there were ways that wouldn't endanger other people's Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it was Mike Disclaimer These opiini H H damn H H Q w q wq wq d X exit X Q C quitbye CtrlAltDel q q logout save quit QUIT zz ZZZZZZ vi man vi L c E X I T help helpquit D d man help C c e help exit Quit q CtrlShftDel Hey what does Stop
