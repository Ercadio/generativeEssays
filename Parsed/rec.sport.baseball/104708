From Edward Kim Subject Re Relative value of players In article Joe M Leonard writes Before folks jump on me let me ask the net would the Jays have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given his run support How about an average ML pitcher I can't believe that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive impact on the Jays performance I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but let's give credit where credit is It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Last year when the team went for the month of August and all the other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge Morris went with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly Also let's not underestimate the importance his innings to save the bullpen every fifth If he didn't help us win the AL east forget about the pennent and the world His run support was high runs but so was Stottlemyer's runs and he won only I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and ballgames but this is to his He pitched only as good as he needed to When he was up in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out I hate this expression An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era But Morris being a veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too when the game was on the Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year but let's not change history to suit the BTW I think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do but his era is how much more can he be embarrassed From where I sit I'll let others have the excellent players I'll settle for good enough and the ring ditto Joe Leonard eddie
