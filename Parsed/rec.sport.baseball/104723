From Mark Singer Subject Re The real way to speed up In article Tom Horsley writes The real way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on both teams I suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are paid Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says I want of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses Oh We fans can subsidize the cost of speeding up the games that we don't want to see sped I Checking off that box to finance Presidential campaigns doesn't cost us taxpayers Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy too The Beastmaster I hate to be so sarcastic on such a beautiful Mark Singer
