From David Thornley Subject Re Minnesota Pitching In article SCOTT NELSON writes The rotation has changed due to a strange injury to Scott He developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the New rotation to the best of my mind's knowledge is Kevin Tapani Jim Deshais Pat Mahomes Willie Add Mike Trombley in there somewhere since they need five Mark Guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long As to SS and Short will be played by Scott Leius who played short for much of his career before the At third Mike Pagliarulo and Jeff Reboulet will Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third with Reboulet as the backup Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in DA in muffing what should be routine grounders heck muffing a grounder I would probably have gotten to Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I Leius missed a ball I think Gagne would have reached we will certainly miss Gag's glove this Winfield has struggled during Sunday against the Colorado Rockies he went for with RBIs and scored He looked pretty good Contrary to what the mediots have been saying he looked reasonable at He isn't mid Hrbek but then neither is the Pretty Big Guy himself any more note I'm used to seeing the Twins looking kinda big on the field but not that big If he hits vaguely like last year he's a perfectly good first Note Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several Winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up he didn't have to pick any bad throws for example but I'll take what I saw so David Thornley Have tickets will travel to Dome
