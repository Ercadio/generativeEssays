From Pablo A Iglesias Subject Re How to speed up games marginally realistic In article C sHE LKF ucdavis edu Gary Built Like Villanueva Huckabay writes You want to speed up ballgames Enforce the two minutes between innings As it is, many fields are allowing THREE minutes between them Fifteen seconds before TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or a ball is called Don't grant time to batters just because they want it They may get pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current rule is too lenient , and then enforce it Fifteen seconds is more than enough time If the pitch isn't released in , call it a ball, and restart the clock I've only ever seen this called once Back around I think that Steve Carlton was pitching On the other hand, I am not sure how much effect this would have It seems that most of the time lost is when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this I have wondered why a pitcher is given pitches when he enters the game Let's be serious The relief pitcher has normally been throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes Does he really need more pitches Pablo Iglesias
