From nlu Nelson Lu Subject Re HBP BB BIG CAT In article Greg Woods writes Alright that's I've suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a Galarraga is currently batting over and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing enough What would he have to do to please you guys bat You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team Fine are you willing to bet that he will bat the rest of the way The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far it's that he will hurt them Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the past couple If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen THEN I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough My comment It has happened for the past seasons where have you been that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs it's more along the lines of he's batting and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks We'll see come I have an outstanding bet with someone that Galarraga's OBP will be less than on June GO CALIFORNIA ANGELS Nelson Lu
