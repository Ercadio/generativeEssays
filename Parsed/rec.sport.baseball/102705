From rickert John Rickert Subject mile high runs How many runs will be scored in Denver I don't but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears Zephyrs tenure in the American Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games all league games and the I found the same ratios for Year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect on runs scored I'll stick with my prediction from last year that it'll be one of the top in the NL this year and a fairly large effect on Homeruns though apparently not as large as Atlanta Wrigley Cincinnati and San Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run john rickert
