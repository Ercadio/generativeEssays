From Dennis G Parslow Subject Re Minnesota Pitching DATE Mon Apr FROM Karim Edvard Ahmed Since I haven't been able to keep up with baseball much this season I have a few questions about my favorite team the Minnesota Twins How good does their rotation look The last I heard the order is Tapani Erikson Mahomes Banks and some guy I've never heard sounds pretty pathetic to me Well maybe it will Banks is a year old prospect who hasn't matured as quickly as they would have Mahomes is a year old who is very highly Tapani and Erickson are also young and have looked very good this The last spot was between Jim Deshaies formerly of Houston and and Mike Deshaies hasn't looked very good this spring so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley although they hadn't wanted starters this I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Who is playing short and third Well Scott Leius is the He played mostly last year but was a SS in the minors and moved back after Gagne left to is split maybe between Pagliarulo who has had a great spring and Terry Jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for I'm not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be happy with what they have I like Jorgenson but I fear they might give too much time to How's Winfield doing Sorry can't help you Dennis
