From Mamatha Devineni Ratnam Subject Zane Rescue us from Simmons So far Simmons looks like a total Zane Smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's Now he looks like he is back in his ' form when he had the AL's highest ERA among Four our sake not Ted's sake I hope he pitches with a ERA for the rest of the Yeah Tomlin and Merced are a bit They are still doing BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty Merced had a very good OBA his rookie He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie Walk Well he seems to be on the losing end BUt I still think that Walk desrved his Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through Even if they do what's the He is aright hander like Not a very smart Also I am blaming Leyland in this case since he is hcurrently convinced that LaVAlliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs SLaught should have played in all games he has a good average against right handed pitching Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last Dennis MOeller is SCARY Candeleria Well he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the Maybe it will be in BUt million plus Come Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks Patterson has served the PIrates very well each So far he seems to have pitched well for the I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in The Rookie batters Well Young has surprised me a bit with his instant Other than that their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a I think we should thank Doughty for Rookie Pitchers Worse than expected especially Slaught How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year NOw his value has increased Lonnie Smith Well Eric Davis was signed for a comparable Let's Eric can hit He can run He can field Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year he won't be an He has looked terrible on the bases and in the Management BIG BIG Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Alex Cole The PIrates infield and CF positions look The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four Eric Davis Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable Even without Eric Davis thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole SVan Slyke and Merced I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting Simmons did have options for the Ironically the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really Too Compensatory draft picks for Bonds Forget The pirates can rant and they will not get those As of now the issue is still being Now if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots nothing else On a final Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the Also if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed he has peaked in the second half of the last seasons Pravin Ratnam
