From Subject Jim Lefebvre is an I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have for Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs First of all how could he start Maldonado over After the way May played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench Not to mention that a right hander Maddux I really blew my top when Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS How can you do that just because of the lefty righty thing too much is made of Wilkins is twice the hitter that Shields Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino one of the weakest hitters I have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all day and Lefebre let him hit while May still sat the I think even Arnie Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while Vizcaino was Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in A dishard Cub fan
