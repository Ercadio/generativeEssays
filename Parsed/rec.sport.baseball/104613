From Joseph Sheehan Subject Re Young Catchers In article Mark Singer writes In article Edward Ted Fischer writes I'm still catching up from Spring Break but bear with in the bigs especially when they haven't even played AAA We certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a battery mate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher Lopez' time will Let's give him some time in Javy Lopez has proven over AB in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the He is not being Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at Maybe I need to improve my writing Lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age Unless Lopez is me defensively I'm ' '' and born to play second base he belongs in the major What does he have to do to earn a chance Maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove his worth I don't abs sounds pretty good to me About as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at Talk about me as a Valentine isn't saying he should back He's saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which IMHO he would if given the Val if I'm misinterpreting please let me So far you have come up with two arguments against Lopez He is very ordinary He is young and most players suck when they are The first is He's trying to make the majors with his And the second involves seriously warped Valentine Most players are not ready for the bigs at age see current related posting on Clayton one of my favorites Most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the Those are the arguments against Lopez for the Braves for this But the players who are ready are the best and the ones most likely to benefit from being in the Javy Lopez is not a middle of the road He's the real Again the most important thing a player can do is Lopez does that miles better than Olson or If his defense is good enough for Greenville or Richmond it's good enough for If he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a See Sprague The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out Not superstars mind you but solid experienced The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid MVP candidate at third and one of the better hitting The center field platoon will probably hit However good Lopez' what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive The kid will improve playing at AAA and he probably won't being a reserve with the big Oh where to First of all solid I want good Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at Think of it as TWG without the It's a losing strategy to say We have solid guys we don't need to You used it four times in that paragraph Same for I might add though that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Olson has played three years Berryhill five although and were a The only difference IMHO between Olson and Valle is the supporting Two big I like Justice but I find Gant's trend Call it one and a The Braves' platoon is OK but neither player has any value outside of the Bream LH and Hunter RH are I'll leave the thirdbase comment Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth If the CF platoon hits I'll retrace Likhani's midnight run down Forbes and I live in NY and Got that Mike And doesn't Cox call pitches anyway Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential Why on earth do you people thinkthe Braves made this decision Are they idiots who have built this ballclub They're baseball management possible the most short sighted collection of people in the Do you not believe this goes on Mark Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in Or Cal Eldred wasn't really better than Ricky Bones last year And I'm the You're mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and have in the past admitted being That does qualify you on We'll make an SDCN out of you yet The Beastmaster Mark Singer Gohr pitching more like Voice Tipper Gore I'm Linda Cohn SportsCenter
