From Ken Kubey Subject Re Why is Barry Bonds not batting I like the Clark WIlliams Bonds Pitchers can only walk Clark with outs unlike last year Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on deck Since Matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the Giants a When Bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal and then be driven in with a single by Thompson Manwaring or If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers then you don't want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets Ken Kubey
