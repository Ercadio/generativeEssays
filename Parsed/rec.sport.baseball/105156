From Richard Detweiler Subject How to start Cardinals Mailing list It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net to go through the championship season without a mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look at starting Except there's one little I don't know the first thing about how to do it or what it requires in terms of resources or So if some kind soul could e mail me the particulars of getting starting and managing a mail list I'd see if it would be feasible for me to start a Cards mailing Thanks in advance Dick Detweiler
