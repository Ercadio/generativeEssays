From franjion spot Colorado EDU John Franjione Subject Re Relative value of players Edward Kim writes It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris Last year, when the team went for the month of August, and all the other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly Also, let's not underestimate the importance his innings to save the bullpen every fifth day If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series His run support was high runs but so was Stottlemyer's runs and he won only games I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and ballgames, but this is to his credit He pitched only as good as he needed to be When he was up in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out I hate this expression An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too when the game was on the line I don't buy this at all I think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are Try this exercise XXX is pitching today His team scores in the first inning, and in the fourth XXX gives up in the st through th In the fifth, he gives up runs In the th, he gives up more The score is now , with XXX's team still on top I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch Needs more seasoning Send him to AAA Or to the spice rack John Franjione Department of Chemical Engineering University of Colorado, Boulder
