From Subject Re Finnally, the Phils have support In article C yxMJ BLE news udel edu , Robert C Hite writes In article A writes Everytime I have written on the net about the possibility of a successfuls season by the Philadelphia Phillies, I have gotten ripped from everybody from Pittsburgh to Calcutta But if all the ignoramouses, care to look at this week's Baseball Weekly, they will see that I'm not the only one who considers then as division winners the rest of the most respected baseball writers in the country do as well And what was the reasoning of this genius writer That, even though their pitching is at best sound , they will win on the strength of their offense Lesse ' offense ' offense Thompson Incaviglia ' offense wins ' division winners at least wins So, wins wins Thompson Incaviglia Therefore, wins Thompson Incaviglia What did you learn in school today If you take a math course and your teacher turns out to be Rob Rains, run, don't walk, to drop add P Tierney You obviously don't know what the hell you're talking about No, Thompson and Incaviglia don't equal wins, but I'll take the two of them over Stan Javier and Ruben Amaro HR, AB HR AB I'd say this improvement should equate to or wins at least Then, I'll take Lenny Dykstra who played games last year and project his numbers , hits, B's, HR, RBI, SB over games Thus , hits, B's, HR, RBI, SB Okay, now we'll put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus I have to bump Kruk, Hollins, Daulton RBI numbers up just a tad now lesse they knocked in , , and respectively Don't you think it's fair to add about or RBI to each They managed to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a leadoff hitter Okay bozo, do you think it's fair to add maybe or more wins now Oh, and how can I forget Wes Chamberlain, AB's HR, RBI even WITH a month and in AAA and a horrible first half Well project that over a full season to get HR and RBI or so Is that worth a win or two Finally, take the worse pitching staff in the NL last year, add the worse injury decimation of Okay, now we add Danny jackson, some health, and a full season for Schilling is that worth at least wins Okay we've been conservative and added about wins so far Now we're adding about more wins thanks to the expansion teams Okay, thats wins Lesse dipshit math genuious, Hmmm I think thats good enough to win the worse division in baseball Next time, before you say something foolish, get a clue first Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so called genius BW writer I agree The reasoning was foolish Next time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding to BTW, wins Very funny P Tierney
