From Eric Roush Subject Re Braves Update In article Dale Stephenson writes In Randy Palermo writes In article Eric Roush writes Did you see the same game I saw Gant most reasonable argued a horrible call which Hirschbeck correctly did nothing Gant then proceeded to walk halfway to base lean on his bat and glare at While I don't necessasarily subscribe to the theory of showing people up this was an obvious attempt by Gant to do so to He left Hirschbeck no choice but to take control of the The bottom line is Gant started a dangerous power struggle with Hirschbeck when his team needed him most and he The events I saw were Called strike by Hirschbeck Was it just me or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to the umpire before calling that strike I thought that's why Gant was asking for the appeal to the base umpire he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked swing help from the wrong Shocked looking Gant asks for appeal to first No appeal to first Gant steps out of batters Hirschbeck immediately orders Gant back bad move Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks bad move Hirschbeck yells at Gant is Hirschbeck calls for the After Hirschbeck called for the pitch but before the pitch was thrown Cox came onto the It was obvious that he was trying to get time called before the pitch but no one was Pitch is called a Cox argues couldn't see when he came on the field Cox is ejected players everywhere Play finally Gant shouldn't have ignored Not returning made the strike call fairly Although I suspect an argument might have gotten Gant tossed But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out the whole incident probably would have been Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw with the aforementioned Perhaps it appeared differently at the Personally I was amazed that Gant didn't get But that's why Cox did it's called protecting your And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game all I can say is that you'd be making baseball Even in the worst baseball brawls usually only the major instigators are ejected not everyone who comes onto the And I'd have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the Braves did Anyhow that's my last two cents on the subject barring outrageous I will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving I think there will be some with other teams as I hope Eric
