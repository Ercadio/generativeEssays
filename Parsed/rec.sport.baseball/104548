From Gord Niguma Subject Re Notes on Jays vs Indians Series In A Lyford Beverage writes In article A , Edward Ted Fischer writes In article rudyC Fr q CL netcom com Rudy Wade writes In article C FMxD pM cs dal ca Gord Niguma writes reference to history because he certainly didn't have the best season for second basemen in history He probably didn't even have as good a season as Alomar last year What Do you have some measure like popularity in Toronto doesn't count that you are basing this statement on Uh, yes Baerga has a lot of flash, but Alomar was the better hitter last year BATTERS BA SLG OBP G AB R H TB B B HR RBI BB SO SB CS E BAERGA,C ALOMAR,R This is fascinating You say that Alomar was the better hitter last year, and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga had a better year The only category that I see which shows an advantage for Alomar is OBP Hmmm what about walks and SB Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and beat him in SLG by a lesser margin Even putting aside any other factors, a player with a point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with a point edge in SLG The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely The fact is that Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar while Baerga was making outs, Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et al Gord Niguma fav player John Olerud
