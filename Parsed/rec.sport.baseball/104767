From Dale Stephenson Subject Hits Stolen Left Field Disclaimer This is for fun In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called stolen hits , defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort Using the Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols Thanks Sherri , I've figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders Hits Stolen have been redefined as Plays Kevin Bass would not have made OK, I realize that's unfair Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor But let's put it this way If we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's out making ability, how many extra hits would go by To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases doubles and triples let by Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player I add this number to OPS to get DOPS Defense Onbase Plus Slug , which should represent the player's total contribution to the team So don't take it too seriously The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article The short version definition of terms HS Hits Stolen Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS Net Hits Stolen Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP Net Double Plays Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB Net Extra Bases Extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder DCON Defensive Contribution bases and hits prevented, as a rate DOPS DCON OPS quick dirty measure of player's total contribution National League Name HS NHS NEB DCON DOPS Gonzalez, L Gilkey, B Clark, G Alou, M Bonds, B May, D Gant, R Bass, K Ordered by DOPS Bonds Gilkey Gonzalez Alou Clark NL Average Gant May Bass American League Name HS NHS NEB DCON DOPS Raines, T Anderson, B Henderson, R Vaughn, G Gladden, D Hall, M Mack, S Polonia, L McReynolds, K Maldanado, C Reimer, K Order by DOPS Henderson Anderson Raines Mack Vaughn Hall AL Average Maldanado McReynolds Gladden Reimer Polonia More discussion DCON formula NHS NDP PA NHS NDP NEB AB Why such a bizzare formula Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors For more discussion see the post on Hits Stolen First Base Dale J Stephenson Baseball fanatic It is considered good to look wise, especially when not overburdened with information J Golden Kimball
