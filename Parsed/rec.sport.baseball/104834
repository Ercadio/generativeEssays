From Greg Sarcasm Is A Way Of Life Spira Subject Re Relative value of players In Edward Kim writes In article Joe M Leonard writes Before folks jump on me let me ask the net would the Jays have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given his run support How about an average ML pitcher I can't believe that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive impact on the Jays performance I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but let's give credit where credit is It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Well when you say without Morris you have to mention an assumed If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft toss the ball underhand to the opposition every days then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without If the alternative was replacement level then I think it would've been very close and yes Morris might've made the If the alternative was Frank Viola the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Last year when the team went for the month of August and all the other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge Morris went with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly You can make the argument that the his presence prevented the team from collapsing in Also let's not underestimate the importance his innings to save the bullpen every fifth If he didn't help us win the AL east forget about the pennent and the world Those innings were probably His run support was high runs but so was Stottlemyer's runs and he won only I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and ballgames but this is to his He pitched only as good as he needed to When he was up in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out I hate this expression An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era But Morris being a veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too when the game was on the Well I think is complete What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued Mostly this is because he's a lousy inning pitcher and much better the rest of the That the team can climb out of holes consistently and win them is not to Morris' credit it's to the team's Furthermore while Morris did exceed the W L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasn't done this in previous In fact his W L record in is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs Do you think he just came up with this ability in Look at the postseason games he pitched decently Typical Morris Morris gets behind team rescues He's not responsible for that And in both those games the team just didn't rescue him Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those games the offense just didn't earn him a BTW I think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do but his era is how much more can he be embarrassed Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start anymore he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the Greg
