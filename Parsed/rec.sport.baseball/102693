From Eric Roush Subject Re Young Catchers Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of posts going back to The Braves could be better off if an injury happens I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame Back at the beginning of Spring Training I though Lopez would make the squad Olson was still recovering from his late season injury knee I believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before And then Berryhill was dinged I was looking forward to this because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the Before last season he was the Braves Defensive Catcher prospect while Brian Deak was the Braves Offensive Catcher Besides Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and don't walk enough to be But Olson recovered quickly Berryhill recovered and the Braves went with the two I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldn't have gotten his job There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill After all ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher California and Seattle come to mind Certainly trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to Plus you'd have to eat that salary which isn't huge but isn't tiddleywinks either I think Olson's at about Berryhill at but that's only what I recall Yes I think arbitration eligibility may have a role to play in this What is it that of the year players aren't eligible for arbitration Only the that were on the roster the longest are eligible Of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet From a business standpoint it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June the first time Olson Berryhill go on the I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field which IMO includes Of course today we play the Hopefully we won't need As for the Schuerholz Cox conversation I imagine it went like this Remember they've BOTH been GM's the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired Cox OK we've sent Jones His fielding could be a little Besides Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to Schuerholz Well we'll have to send Nieves down Deion just won't sign that baseball only We can't count on him in October so we have to keep Nixon around for the Besides Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs we can move Nixon for Frankie That ought to give us some pitching depth in Cox Yep that'll be Too bad Deion won't OK I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry back problems Now what about Klesko Schuerholz Well we've still got to fork out another mil for If we keep Klesko we either lose the money or I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same First Jeffries for Jose and now Whiten for Clark If he gets rid of Brian Jordan then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings Cox OK keep trying on Bream and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter Klesko Maybe I can get a few extra at bats for Cabrera while we Try if Snow starts slowly maybe WhiteyDal will bite on And if that doesn't work then perhaps Sid's knees could be persuaded to act There's always the day DL Mwa ha ha ha ha Schuerholz What about Caraballo Cox Well he's not that much better than Maybe if he starts in Richmond he'll start walking Besides if he's going to be arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big Schuerholz Now let's That leaves Cox NOOOOO I gotta keep Lopez Sure I didn't think Olson would recover this Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again Schuerholz Nope Lopez has gotta You know that he'll get million in May as well put it off that one extra Besides until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit I can't trade Besides Berryhill's a left handed You know how rare that is Cox Don't you mean a left handed whiffer Pretty common if you ask I mean he made Pat Borders look good in the World PAT BORDERS Schuerholz Hey you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the Cox Well you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon Besides I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's He got some time with them this pretty Come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate Schuerholz Yeah but which stiff Whichever one we keep will be hurt by Cox OK OK you made your Keep them Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the Then I can call up Lopez and then we can win games The Pennant THE WORLD SERIES I'll be up there with John McGraw Casey Stengel Earl Weaver Oh they laughed at me in Toronto but have you ever had to deal with George Bell I'll finally get my just reward Mwa ha ha ha Schuerholz Easy Have you been taking those happy pills left around by Chuck Tanner Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow Cox Don't ask me ask Eric Roush fierkelab I am a Marxist of the Groucho sort Grafitti Paris TANSTAAFL although the Internet comes
