From Marc Stephenson Subject Re Astros Are Back In article Schwam David writes In article Marc Stephenson Astros relief corps holding If Doug Jones keeps his changeup effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then it's There's no reasonable left handed help and the middle relief is Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but he's been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him Doug Jones can lose his touch he went from Cleveland's all star closer to the minors in a pretty short From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of Art Doug Jones is the key to Houston's He must have another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL No argument at all with He scared the hell out of me when he came in last On the other hand the club though enough of Boever to put him into an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances he did at least at some point He seemed to be a very viable setup guy but I guess that's not considered that crucial by the I can just remember two years ago so well The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting on Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to assume Biggio and Finley's Biggio concerns me since he usually starts the season very I'm not that Those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries not old I expect them to come through just It's those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part even if they are coming through right On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year's uniform There is talk that their road uniform will be traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the If I'm not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange McLane's favorite color is red This sounds like their old road Pretty Buttons or pullovers I'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some I'm really the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound I'd like to see the uniform of the mid They may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and I liked Well we'll I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the Astros stripes across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in i can see why they might want that to Gee if they eliminate the orange will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section what used to be the gold and yellow levels I don't know those numbers they use now I saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked good Marc Stephenson IBM AWS Advanced Workstations Systems Austin TX DISCLAIMER The content of this posting is independent of official IBM INTERNET VNET MARC at AUSVMQ IBM T L
