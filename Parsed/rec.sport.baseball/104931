From roger crux Princeton EDU Roger Lustig Subject Re New Home for the Bosox In article A jay rogoff writes I agree, though I'd also be happy with a stadium that looks like new Comiskey The new park was also made for baseball Unlike Three Rivers, the Vet, Riverfront, etc , it's not a football park in which they also play baseball While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which was designed to accommodate both the Mets Jets It was the first stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football Not the first RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built years earlier Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition games but the rd base LF lower deck used to move It was all metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football stadium , the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the action The Mets announcers Kiner Murphy in particular have always hyped it as beautiful Shea Stadium, a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is It's vastly better than it was before they fixed it, though Back in the late 's it was a dump Roger don't you like jet noise
