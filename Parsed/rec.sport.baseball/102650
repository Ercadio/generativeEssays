From Driftwood Subject Re Jim Lefebvre is an I totally agree with each point you Jose Viscaino looked like a single A hitter up Who swings on count with Maddux pitching and your teams down by a run and you haven't touched the ball all I also think too much is made of that lefty righty Watching the Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what the Cubs should be doing than Lefebre Harry said it best when he stated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat we can't wait til Sandberg returns
