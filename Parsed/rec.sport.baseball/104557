From Greg Spira Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME Steve Tomassi writes Hi, baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean, heck, if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it, as is Lee Smith ha , then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah, yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top players of all time Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since , with the possible exception of Gossage On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best players of all time And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise Well, in any case, I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal We're talking of the top players of all time here There probably aren't shortstops in history who were better than these two Let's be a little more selective, huh Stop handing out these honors so liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it, if something isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates, the absurdity is apparent Garvey sucked Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't belong near Cooperstown Gee, can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan If Puckett and Ryan okay, no if there get into to the Hall, they will be marginal Hall of Famers unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players Robin Yount Ozzie Smith Dave Winfield Eddie Murray Darrel Evans Kirby Puckett Nolan Ryan Jack Morris Dave Kingman Steve Garvey To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall Of the eligible players whose career stats equaled , are in the Hall of Fame The ones who aren't include th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby Grich, and Bob Johnson Of those eligible who score between and , of are in Of those eligible who score between and , of are in Greg
