From Greg Spira Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME Steve Tomassi writes Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean heck if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top players of all Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since with the possible exception of On the other hand Kingman probably isn't one of the best players of all And Reardon though a good pitcher isn't in Smith's class career Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long Big We're talking of the top players of all time There probably aren't shortstops in history who were better than these Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so Save them for the guys who really deserve Face it if something isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates the absurdity is Garvey Morris while a very good pitcher simply doesn't belong near Gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan If Puckett and Ryan okay no if there get into to the Hall they will be marginal Hall of Famers unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer To put this in perspective here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make While no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average Robin Yount Ozzie Smith Dave Winfield Eddie Murray Darrel Evans Kirby Puckett Nolan Ryan Jack Morris Dave Kingman Steve Garvey To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall Of the eligible players whose career stats equaled are in the Hall of The ones who aren't include century players Ron Santo Bobby Grich and Bob Of those eligible who score between and of are Of those eligible who score between and of are Greg
