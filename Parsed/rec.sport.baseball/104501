from sherri nichols subject re braves pitching updatedir in article writes or second starter it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
>mound, the other teams score less runs. the team that scores the most >runs wins. this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
>(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). a low >scoring game would clearly benefit the braves. not clear to me at all. i'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
4-1 games than 2-1 games. in the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 4-1 game. sherri nichols
