From Subject Re How does a pitcher get a save In article A , GEOFFREY E DIAS writes The subject line says it all What is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is th inning or beyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game For example If it is the bottom of the th inning and Clemens is pithching The Red Sox are leading and Clemens has just givin up a hit So, there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer If Jeff Russel came in, The Red Sox reliever , and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save and Clemens would get the win Thats how I beleive it works Hope I could help, THE COWBOY
