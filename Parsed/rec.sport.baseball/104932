From roger Roger Lustig Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME In article Steve Tomassi writes Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean heck if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Um what Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a long Winfield as produced consistently for almsot years and excellently on several Dave Kingman's best year was like Darryl Strawberry's typical year with the Darrell Evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which is all that Kong Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards Whom are you talking about Yes Eddie Murray is marginal but that's because he's years He wasn't marginal for a long Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long Big Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better than anyone else ever Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadn't One of his two MVP awards was as a Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so Save them for the guys who really deserve Face it if Like whom There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near as goos as the guys you're running something isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame When That's already the case by some But the bad players in the Hall are all from the 's and ' Recent picks have generally been certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates the absurdity is Gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan No but who cares Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth Not But he obviously belongs The Hall has generally had about the top of major As more players come through the game more will be in that top And yes it's pretty easy to argue that Smith Yount Evans Winfield are in the top Dave Kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his Of course Garvey hasn't gotten a lot of HOF press so I don't know what you As for Ryan is his W L better than Morris' That's what a lot of voters tend to look And Morris was awfully good for a decade and doesn't lead MLB history in walks allowed Roger
