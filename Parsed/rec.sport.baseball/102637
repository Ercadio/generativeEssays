From CONNIN PATRICK COLGAIN Subject East is best in baseball Is there any doubt that this is true After a few down years the East is back to where it was in the early With the emergence of the O's and the Yanks it is far and away the While the West has the best team in baseball and the Reds aren't bad either they have nothing The Giants Astros and Padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the And the Dodgers just plain As for the Rockies who knows The East has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to free agency Toronto is still one of the best in The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina and you can never forget about The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't hurt to much either although I always liked Bill While they let a lot go this summer Randy Milligan Joe Orsulak Bill Ripken Bob Milacki Sam Horn Storm Davis and Craig Lefferts they kept the heart of their team My predicted finish Baltimore Could be a biased opinion NY Yankees Toronto Milwaukee Detroit Boston Cleveland Would have been higher if not for the accident Go O's
