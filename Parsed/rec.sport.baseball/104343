From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Old Predictions to laugh Oops I came across this file from last Thought you might enjoy some of these The predictions were made on the date They are largely out of June ME What have I done I computed the expected winning percentage for each team from their OBP total bases and runs I use the basic RC formula and the pythagorean I then compare this with their actual winning All stats through June Team OBP TB RA W L XWP Diff baltimore boston toronto new york milwaukee detroit cleveland minnesota oakland texas chicago california kansas city seattle You all know how things turned The Orioles Red Sox and Yankees all The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second The Rangers predictably took a That shouldn't have surprised Meanwhile as predicted the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and They clearly didn't deserve the record in The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit while the Twins dropped off a But for the most part things were as Okay so there were a few blatant But for a predictive calculation I thought this did pretty From CAVGEOE Tue Mar The Braves insert Kent Mercker into the starting rotation sometime this year Bielecki is traded or released Lei brandt becomes the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball has Pena Berenguer Stanton Wohlers Freeman and Pete Smith who spot starts as Pete Smith made the rotation instead of And Bielecki wasn't released until the end of the I won't comment on the Jeff Reardon Blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end of Bream goes on the DL and Klesko goes on a nice hitting honeymoon a la Gregg Jefferies in platooning with Mitchell wins the center field job a bit later All Star break and Nixon stays on as a valuable pinch Lonnie is released unless the Braves find a taker in a Right on Wrong on Bream and A bit early on Lonnie as with Didn't pick Did anybody Managers to be fired this year in chronological order Fregosi Showalter Valentine Riddoch Three of them went right Showalter is still around and likely to stick it seems From Tue Mar Bonds gets traded from Bucs for some young Nope They won the division and so kept him for a shot at the Mets win division Well they didn't finish Atlanta repeats in the West Got that one Yankees surprise everyone but finish second behind Dwight Gooden wins but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win huh Roger Clemens is injured early in the Tsk Not nice to predict something like Strawberry fails to hit even home runs and is often Due to Dodgers drop out of You got that right And my From tedward Tue Mar Hmph Can tell you are a Mets fan Do you mind if I make some counter predictions against yours They follow Mets come in third behind Pittsburgh and Okay so the Mets finished But I got the Pirates and Expos right The Yankees offense and pitching flounders dropping them to fourth place in the AL Boston wins games the division the pennant and the World First half Dead on Second half I'm a Sox fan go easy on me Dwight Gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out and goes on the DL from May through mid Saberhagen runs a record WFAN criticizes the Mets for giving away that great talent Jefferies who has a solid year in So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen I was at least close and was right about Though I don't HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade Roger Clemens wins another CY as well as No In article lI Amit Likhyani writes Excerpts from Apr Re NL East Smiley trade' CAVGEOE OPS Projected for HoJo I will streak naked down Forbes avenue if HoJo does not muster more than a Something is wrong with that Some predictions need no introduction From Mon Apr From Do you care to put your prediction down for posterity You predict Mark Grace will get I say you are out of your That is almost impossible for a HR type guy batting behind Who kills most of the rallies he doesn't Why do you say that Mark has driven in ' and ' Last year Mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year average Since he is batting either or this year I predict he will be back up to his previous standards I think he will be better rbi's is not that much of a Sometimes us statheads get Grace didn't hit behind Dawson the entire season but he also finished with only From Tue May The most ballsy prediction ever Mark McGwire will hit or more HRs this He slowed down and the injury finished him Didn't even reach But a ballsy prediction From ECAXRON Thu May Baltimore will not They will not win the division this year but they will finish within five I find the prospect of two Orioles winning each easier to comprehend than that of two No offense I think their pitching is about as good as the division has to The Orioles finished seven games None of them won though Mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts Nobody else in the division is worth a They all finish a minimum of fifteen games out the Tribe That's another reason to watch Baltimore this year and next they won't waste many of those games against the rest of the Except for the Brewers who you probably forgot you were right The rest of the division was thoroughly The Yankees and Indians led with wins the Red Sox trailed with None were horrible but four were five or more games below From David Johnson Date Thu Aug GMT That was I never said the Jays were a cinch to clinch it but I said that Milwaukee will be more of a threat than I do think that Toronto should win it but after ' I don't consider anything a cinch unless you have something like a game lead with games to I do think that the Jays have the best talented team in the AL East and if we had a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right I also think that the Orioles will not play much better than baseball for the rest of the You win From king Thu Nov In article you write Indians the first and only season ever Prediction The Cleveland indians will win or more games next You were right From Fri Sep Jose Rijo will win the Cy Young award IF he is healthy enough to go at least Who would have thought he would try to steal a base Why risk such an injury He had IP but didn't win the Cy Maddux surprised The Orioles will win games in at least of the next years probably the last and their pitching staff will have a team ERA among the best in the AL in at least of the next years but not necessarily all the same years as they win This one will take a long time to I don't think I want to wait that But they won games last year and they were fifth in the league in Not a bad Ben McDonald will not challenge for an ERA title in the next years nor will he have victories either By challenge I mean FINISH among the leaders being among the leaders BEFORE the season is done doesn't He will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to Looks like He wasn't bad last year just too consistent to be an So far this year looks like more of the The Phillies will give up many fewer walks if when they get rid of their bullpen coach Ryan I am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust before seeing the radical They would have a fine pitching staff if they would just steal Ray Miller away from The White Sox seem to have the same problem but not as I honestly can't Did they get rid of him Their BB totals were down last Ricky Jordan will have rbi IF he starts games hitting in the or or spot in any lineup or the spot in a lineup with very good OBP in the This applies for each of the next I just don't think he's that Billy Ripken will never again hit over with So far so I'm definitely not waiting to check this From panix spira Fri Sep No matter what Lou Gorman and his scouts say Paul Quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league Never I have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out per innings at AAA be successful in the Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long He has a rubber arm and unusual He might be decent in that From Sat Sep Frank Thomas Hal Morris Division Winners East Baltimore Orioles West Chicago White Sox Pennant Chicago White Sox East Louis Cardinals West Cincinatti Reds Pennant Cincinatti Reds Champion Cincinatti Reds Wrong on all of the Hal Morris And my favorites From tedward Sun Oct Belle will not walk as many as times in Belle will hit more HR than he has walks in Belle hit HR last year walking times but five of those were intentional Okay so I But I might have been From Tue Mar Are the O's going to sign Cal of is Eli's wallet welded shut outgoing money only wide open for incoming cash My prediction which you may make note of Valentine is that Eli Jacobs will defer any serious negotiations on Cal Ripken's contract until the ' season is Eli will give Cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last year's pace before coming forth with an Despite claims that OP CY was designed to Cal's strength my feeling is that the foot left center canyon will cut down on Cal's power After all it's hard to credibly to offer million year to an All Star game MVP AL MVP Gold Glove shortstop baseball deity but it'd be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full season Of course if Cal does match his ' numbers then Eli is going to be faced with a rather huge and expensive How much did Cal sign for When did he sign If I remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak And From Thu Sep Generally because of expansion in there will be a lot of mediocre talent hanging Much of it will not make it as the expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their My specific predictions As of April Jim Acker and Cory Snider will be selling aluminum Snyder is still in Acker is gone Neither Charlie Kerfeld nor Vance Lovelace presently in Tiger AA but formerly big leaguers will be playing professional They aren't in the Nor will Dave Rozema who says he's keeping in shape with a hope for another shot with expansion Never heard of Shawn Hare and Jody Hurst will be in the major They are outfielders in the Tiger minor league system I don't think they are in the Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Dunno what happened to It will be bye bye for If he's still around he's stuck in the Bo Jackson will not be a With Raines out Bo looks to get a lot of Gary Huckaby will have moved to Alaska permanently they're on the net and Dave Kirsch will return to Canada to Thanks for listening Valentine
