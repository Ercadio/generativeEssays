>> i'm not so sure. top 10 total career value? yes, almost certainly. >point taken. when was winfield's peak years anyway? probably around 85. that's the trouble: *what* peak years? he wavers between excellent and
very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there. 1979 was a fine
year; 78 and 80 were merely really good. with the yankees, 84 (i think)
was the best; that was the one with the .340 ba. of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either. he's been in the bigs since 1973,
with a one-year intermission for surgery.  though he doesn't have the
mix of skills that pete rose did, he's like pete rose in one way: he's 
not a natural hitter.  winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in new york, and that includes the gulf+western building.  but his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  

fascinating player to watch, even now.  not obviously great in any one
way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels.
