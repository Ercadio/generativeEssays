From Jonathan King Subject What does Jeff King suck t was Second guessing the Pirates Ken Z writes I'm still hoping for a season from the Bucs but I really wished they would have coughed up the to keep Doug around Actually, I was hoping for Barry Bonds Oh well P S Jeff King still sucks Check this out from the latest McWeekly BA SLG OBP HR RBI Jeff King Jose Lind First off, Jeff has had like hits in the last two games, and walked yet again Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which means his SLG won't be below , and his walks are way up If that increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third baseman in Jose Lind, on the other hand, still doesn't walk, and clearly isn't a hitter My bet is that he won't be getting any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the Lind Shift we were seeing in the NL Any predictions as to when he is sent to Buffalo or released outright No, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really surprise me Jeff King is currently in the top in the league in walks Something is up jking
