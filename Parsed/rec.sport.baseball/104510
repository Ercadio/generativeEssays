From Bruce 'DoppleAckers Anonymous' Hasch Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME In article Steve Tomassi Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean heck if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Oh Dave Winfield marginal Guy didn't hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying Dave Winfield now entering his I believe big league season is still a damn decent Admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great Take a look at the stats I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar Kingman was a one dimension power hitter he couldn't field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if I remember right his OBP wasn't THAT and for those who consider such things important was a absolute primo Eddie Murray Yup only the best baseman of the ' I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in it seems that he wasn't overrated by the Lee Smith This one's actually pretty He's had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks Wrigley I'd have to take a closer look at the stats it's been a while but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch Simply because Minnesota and Boston and for a month Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of No way should HomerMan be in the HOF Darrell Evans Nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like Ted Simmons IMHO but not a HOF' Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards Lemme ask you Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long Big Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so Save them for the guys who really deserve Face it if something Now wait a goddamn minute Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of Gold Again Gold Gloves are mediot biased and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early 's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his Ozzie's offense you ask Good OBP great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power 'cept against Tom Niedenfuer but still a definite asset Yount hits MVP at two different positions uh huh a real His ' was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks as far as SS numbers He's a clear HOF'er isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates the absurdity is Gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan Well as far as Garvey goes you're Garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree Garvey shouldn't be in the SkyJack I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' ability to win which is nothing more than Morris' ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs At this point Morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in ' he may be damned close to But in all fairness Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 's for up and down Tiger While was obviously a great year for Detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not Morris' career numbers are quite good and worthy of HOF consideration Ryan Of course but be I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time After all Nolan never won a Damn he's just pitcher who hung around for His W L record is Of course Nolan's a HOF' Puck Probably although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years years even good ones aren't enough to make the HOF most likely That said I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something REALLY tragic or sudden He's very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the I've always liked the guy and I hope he does make And in the end I think the Puck will make it But really it's too early to This debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not I never tire of It's an interesting Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each I probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about again too early to Note these are all active players I'm not counting recent retirees Baltimore Cal Ripken should be a lock by now even if Gehrig's record stands Boston Roger Clemens might be a lock already which is amazing Dawson Detroit Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker possibilities Milwaukee Robin Yount discussed earlier New York Wade Boggs possibly Mattingly long shot Toronto Paul Molitor and Jack Morris possibilities Kansas City George Brett lock Minnesota Kirby too early to tell Winfield lock Oakland Eckersley lock McGwire too early Rickey lock Welch LONG shot Texas The Mighty Nolan Too early to consider Canseco or Strange Cubs Sandberg lock Louis Ozzie lock Lee Smith probably New York Murray almost a lock Saberhagen obviously he's got to regain past form And most certainly NOT Vince Coleman despite what he'll tell you Los Angeles Butler Strawberry and Hershiser are all long San Diego Tony Gwynn pretty good shot Colorado Dale Murphy a good shot Ryan Bowen just to see if you're awake Before I get flames this is an off the top of the head list there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off and I didn't include Barry Bonds Will Clark Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher Frank Thomas Canseco McGriff because I only considered guys who started playing before E mail or post I almost fear what I may have started Bruce Hasch Sell the team Eli If a hitter is a good fastball hitter does that mean I should throw him a bad fastball Larry Andersen
