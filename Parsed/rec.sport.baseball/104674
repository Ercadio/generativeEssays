from david g paschich subject re hbp bb big cat in article ken kubey writes i suppose a foul ball machine (like brett butler) is pretty valuable, but i'd rather watch (and root for) the lower obp guys who can actually hit the ball. and i'd rather watch (and root for) a team that scores lots of runs
and wins games. of course, i'm rooting for the rockies and andres anyway. but that's
for irrational hometown reaons. i also root for frank thomas. :) david paschich
