Subject Re Best Homeruns From Ian M Derby I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the Expos in that decided the NL East It was also his career high th Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the ALCS The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox strike away from the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in baseball The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the WS against the Mets Speaking of the METS, isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST mirrored the NLCS with the Phillies The Astros have been painfully close twice I must admit
