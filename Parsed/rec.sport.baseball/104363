being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose, might have been corrected in richmond. (did you intend a smiley after your comment?) this brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop braves fans who
kept being promised the bob horner - dale murphy back to back power slam. who
could stop that? guess we'll never know. p.s. - rocky fans (are there any yet?) is dale getting any playing time out
there? i plan to be at the game on june 28th, they'll have to play him then. -- "read that to memory and process it!" - russell earnest
