From Richard Detweiler Subject Re ESPN and Expansion In article Donnie Trump writes I was watching Peter Gammons on ESPN last night and he's got me a little While talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players they'll be facing McGriff hitting home runs Sheffield getting rbi's and Glavine winning This was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 's late 's late 's What really confused me though was the mention of AL players who would do well next Specifically Roger Clemens winning games and the likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting home My question is How in the hell will the Rockies Marlins help the AL The last time I looked there wasn't a lot of talent jumping Did I miss something Dennis Cleary I wondered the same When he first mentioned it I thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and And then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league So since stats NEVER lie I guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been Make sense
