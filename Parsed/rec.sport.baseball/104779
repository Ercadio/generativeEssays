from john f carr subject re proposed catcher re sub rule the red sox usually have catchers i don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder. you don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field. -- john carr ()
