From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Jack Morris In article SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes Hey Valentine I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their So Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his He certainly didn't earn his last HOW many games did he blow in the World Series All of the ones he started Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best Oh Therefore Morris is better than Don't give me that If Boston had Alomar Olerud Henke and Ward while Toronto had Rivera Jack Clark Jeff Reardon things would have looked a little different last Give credit where credit is This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me And don't tell me Boston will win this They won't even be in the top in the division more like I'm willing to bet they don't finish I'm also willing to bet they don't finish And if you give me odds I'm willing to bet that they finish ahead of the Blue Valentine
