From Mike Jones Subject Re Relative value of players Edward Kim writes In article C ro H L Joe M Leonard writes Before folks jump on me, let me ask the net would the Jays have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given his run support How about an average ML pitcher I can't believe that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive impact on the Jays performance I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris Last year, when the team went for the month of August, and all the other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went with a pretty good era I can't remember exactly Also, let's not underestimate the importance his innings to save the bullpen every fifth day If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series A guy who threw innings with about run lower ERA would have saved the bullpen even more Say, somebody like Frank Viola innings His run support was high runs but so was Stottlemyer's runs and he won only games I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and ballgames, but this is to his credit He pitched only as good as he needed to be When he was up in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out I hate this expression An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too when the game was on the line Nice audition tape Send it to Baseball Tonight ATTN Ray Knight ESPN Bristol, CT Have you, by chance, taken a look at the boxscores from last year to determine the accuracy of your account I seem to recall Morris getting at least or wins last year when the Jays came back from behind after they had decided to pull Morris at the end of an inning Mike Jones AIX High End Development Dictionaries are merely checkpoint records of linguistic history Truly Donovan
