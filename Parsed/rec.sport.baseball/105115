From Jon Hamkins Subject Re Triva question on Bosio's No hitter Matthew Wall writes I don't actually have the answer to this one Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired straight for a back end perfect game Well, there were outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but really, he only retired batters in a row The first out of the game was the front end of a double play Still counts as a back end perfect game in my book, though Congrats to Chris Bosio Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him Jon Hamkins University of Illionois
