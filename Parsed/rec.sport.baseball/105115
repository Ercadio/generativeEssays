From Jon Hamkins Subject Re Triva question on Bosio's No hitter Matthew Wall writes I don't actually have the answer to this Bosio after walking the first two batters retired straight for a back end perfect Well there were outs in a row with no hits or walks in between but really he only retired batters in a The first out of the game was the front end of a double Still counts as a back end perfect game in my book Congrats to Chris Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to Jon Hamkins University of Illionois
