From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Bosox win again against Seattle In article Dark Wing Duck writes Last night, Boston Red Sox win its games of games by beating Seattle Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate He walked at least man in first inns Be fair He did walk batters in IP He also allowed only three hits, none for extra bases Only one run A pretty good outing, all told I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle, considering Darwin will faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight There is no such thing as a must win game this early in the season And we can always hope that Darwin pitches well Cheers, Valentine
