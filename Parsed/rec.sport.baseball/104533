From Dale Stephenson Subject Re Notes on Jays vs Indians Series In C HpG LM andy bgsu edu Bruce Klopfenstein writes Edward Kim writes I would tend to call the offensive contributions even, but Alomar wins hands down in defensive capabilities I'm not just talking about the number of errors nobody including Lind has the range and athleticism at second base I can't recall in the recent past anyone turning the double play better than Alomar Well, why don't you look up those stats Baerga may not be the best defensive second baseman in the league, but he's damn good Check the stats for DPs last year and see for yourself According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average So who would be better Using Alomar's opportunities groundballs, possible double plays Alomar had groundouts and turned DPs Baerga would have had with same DA DP groundouts and DPs Using Baerga's opportunites groundballs, possible double plays Alomar would have had with the same DA DP groundouts and DPs Baerga had groundouts and DPs Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP would be lower with a different SS Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall Dale J Stephenson Grad Student At Large It is considered good to look wise, especially when not overburdened with information J Golden Kimball
