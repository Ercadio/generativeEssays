From franjion John Franjione Subject Re Why is Barry Bonds not batting Edward Hui writes In article punjabi sanjeev punjabi writes As the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting for the Giants behind Will Barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter definitely the best in the National IMHO to have Williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the simple reasons Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get more good pitches to This is important since he struggles so much with breaking Opposing pitchers don't want to walk Williams to get to I don't understand this at Matt Williams has demonstrated throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to He won't take He'd rather If I'm the opposing pitcher why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well when I know that Williams will swing and miss or at least not hit very well at a low and away curve John Franjione Department of Chemical Engineering University of Colorado Boulder
