From Tim Shippert Subject Re Infield Fly Rule jay rogoff writes One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't yet been I believe the rule also does not deal with this situation However if the Infield Fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early The runner can leave his base at any If the ball is caught he's got to tag If it isn't caught he doesn't have to tag up at So if he's feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped If it isn't caught he's probably scored a If it is he's probably headed for The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on All other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped Tim Shippert If we are going to stick to this damned quantum jumping then I regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum Schrodinger
