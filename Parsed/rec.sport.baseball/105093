From fester Mike Fester Subject Re White and black racism was about the In article Jonathan King writes There's too many 's here for my taste by now which means I've reached my maximum depth on this I've cut out some things below but nothing that should affect the sense of the I I'll delete more as fester Mike Fester writes Jonathan King writes Perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a malingerer I guess I don't understand your I was trying to imply that the accusations of Glenn Davis' malingering were certainly not played up very Still if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco it is certainly possible they were stronger Also it was teammates making the In any event I know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple But in any case I believe Mike Lavalliere has been accused of poor work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering just as he was being It's interesting that nobody heard much about these problems before if they were so I have heard Sanders called many things as I have NOT heard him called Given the sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as Exactly Which means his media detractors have had to say other things about I believe it's a general phenomenon that if writers don't like you they'll find a label that will stick no matter who you I find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in why writers feel they need to act this Not that this fascinates me that much Uh the original author's point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his Sanders' name showed up I dispute that Sanders has ever been called lazy by the media Hmm big ego possible club house disturbance Is that GOOD press No but it isn't the total extent of the press he received in Pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and spoiled by the local Again the actual words used may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher on the list for non white players at least in my subjective Aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken and on teams like the Red Sox which have been traditionally Nowadays most people think of Carl Yastrzemski as one of those blue collar hard working guys but in the early he was often portrayed as a lazy I never heard anyone accuse Canseco of being Nor I've heard accusations that Canseco was a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put his mind to it Ignoring whether or not he is a Actually Dave Stewart is was one of the most vocal about In any event that is not lazy At least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the Canseco is lazy issue so I think your point is at best a quibble and probably weaker than Uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first It is NOT a quibble then to state that the media did not portray Canseco as being If the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a And in fact the media around here tend ed to play up his time in the wieght Hardly lazy and hardly a quibble Have you ever seen any mediot portray Canseco as lazy Unconcerned with his fielding Lazy bad fielder I think this is still For that matter I think Canseco's colorful off field antics get lots more national attention than those of say Roger Well he's had a few more of At least more that you've heard I think one of the questions here surrounds selective Having said that I have to say that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of us who aren't reporters police or private Well Canseco has been involved in several felonies including his high speed record carrying concealed fire arms and of course the domestic Clemens had a run in at a Canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively Puckett Stewart Jackson I said over represent non Three anecdotal data points don't make an interesting counter BTW which Jackson are we talking about here Reggie Bo Darrin Danny or Uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal And it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own stats than for the good of the team It also seems to me that you're Kirby Puckett I have NEVER heard this accusation made of I have heard it of Actually I believe it of him but that's another Not living in Minnesota I can't say whether or not this line has ever been used against Kirby As far as Boggs goes I'm not sure why you bring him up since he's one of the obvious prototypes for the line I quoted along with Ted Williams Rod Carew and many others Uh yes and I agree with your assesment of Boggs rather However you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of I have not ever anywhere heard this said of Pendleton Similarly Brett B Williams and How about Daryl Strawberry And I think the plus or minus refers more to the born again types ie Butler and Again you seem to be making an argument from On the other hand my argument by is of the because jon says so variety if we have no other I have to admit I have problems generating lists of non white players who became in famous for their religious or political beliefs while names like Butler Gaetti Dravecky Knepper Hersheiser et come rolling There are Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the born again types I Mike
