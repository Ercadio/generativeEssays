From Mike Jones Subject Re Jack Morris Roger Maynard writes It sure And it all depends on the definition that you use for better Yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really Well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it But that's OK I understand you have a hockey Stats like plus minus make RBI look Is it Viola's fault that Boston had no offense Is it because of Morris that the Blue Jays had such a strong offense Don't tell me that Morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more This is the perfect example of your You are isolating Viola's contribution from the rest of the team's You can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without Only then can you But you cannot know how the team would have done without Your analysis is OK how about a straigh answer Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer Please answer yes or no Roger Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs AL only For anyone else following along it is a well known and demonstrable fact that a team's win loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team It's not a definite hard and fast function but there is definitely a In fact as a rule of thumb if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs for every runs fewer than Y that team B allows it will win another So for instance if we look at the Toronto Blue Jays we find that they scored runs and allowed of which Morris allowed All other things being equal if Frank Viola with his ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the innings Morris threw plausible since Viola threw for Boston the Red Jays would have allowed about fewer runs or enough for more Now that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than So um Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis Clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a if he had been on the Jay last year but that is not the We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that had Morris performed as Viola did his team would have been better It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world This is true but not so open that your brain falls Mike Jones AIX High End Development you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large Got that Zaphod Beeblebrox
