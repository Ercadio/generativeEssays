From Sherri Nichols Subject Re HBP BB BIG CAT In article Ken Kubey writes I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like McGwire Bonds and Frank Thomas was I just said that it But why McGwire and not Carter I can see some justification for Bonds or Thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter Sherri Nichols
