From Jonathan King Subject Re Zane Rescue us from Simmons Mamatha Devineni Ratnam writes So far Simmons looks like a total Whatever you I think it's just games into the season myself so I'm going to wait a bit before calling I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last Now Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmons' Now he looks like he is back in his ' form when he had the AL's highest ERA among Four our sake not Ted's sake I hope he pitches with a ERA for the rest of the Yeah I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted On the other hand I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty BTW Otto's game score for that IP stinker was only which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly Tomlin and Merced are a bit They are still doing But considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats and Tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy Walk Well he seems to be on the losing end BUt I still think that Walk desrved his No he didn' Walk is a time He has no stuff whatsoever and when the league finally realizes this it won't be pretty at The Rookie batters Well Young has surprised me a bit with his instant Other than that their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a I think we should thank Doughty for Don't be so Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the Meanwhile I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six year free agent before the Rookie Pitchers Worse than expected especially Twice through the rotation and you've given up Slaught How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year Now his value has increased But so has his age at least in baseball The useful half life of a year old injury prone catcher can't be much longer than a Lonnie Smith Well Eric Davis was signed for a comparable But he wanted to be a Dodger and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign Let's Eric can hit He can run He can field Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie He certainly wasn't last Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year he won't be an He has looked terrible on the bases and in the Hey that's the Skates Smith package Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base running particularly at this stage is a real Management BIG BIG Sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa If that's the goal of the team ownership than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing so I can't comment Alex Cole stuff deleted Ironically the biggest accomplishment of Simmons' tenure was getting Alex Cole really Too that he gave him away in the expansion It's annoying but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King it was probably Meanwhile I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year drafting well in letting the rookies show something in Foley Smith and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' Compensatory draft picks for Bonds Forget The pirates can rant and they will not get those As of now the issue is still being Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case I never heard the outcome of When will the final verdict be in on this Now if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots nothing else I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case so I don't know who to It might have been Doug Danforth after In fact I seriously suspect it was Doug Danforth who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his btw I've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site so if somebody known to impersonate cummings can see this would he drop me a short note jking
