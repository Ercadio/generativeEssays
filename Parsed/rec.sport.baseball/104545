From Dale Stephenson Subject Re Defensive Averages , Third Base In C JJrJ EM Dale Stephenson writes Compiled from the last five Defensive Average reports, here are the career DAs for the individual players in the reports Stats are courtesy of Sherri Nichols Players are listed in descending order And some comments, with some players deleted Third Basemen Name Mitchell, Kevin Yep, that Kevin Mitchell I never would have expected him in the spot Gonzales, Rene It's no accident that the first two names are only As with first and second base, was the year of the glove Average DA was points higher in both leagues than any other year Leius, Scott Looks good Too bad he's moving to short Pendleton, Terry Highest five year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell Ventura, Robin Wallach, Tim Gruber, Kelly The other elite fielders in the league Pagliarulo, Mike This is an interesting line His figure was slightly below average His was pathetic, and his was the next best year by anybody Part of that may be his mobility was with the Yankees was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third Williams, Matt Add another to the elite fielders list Caminiti, Ken Sabo, Chris Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value I don't know what happened to Caminiti judging by the three previous years, his low may be a fluke Sabo is merely average, however His incredible best year ever brings his average up a lot Buechele, Steve Strange last two years Schmidt, Mike According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base But at the end, he was below average Average in was Boggs, Wade Boggs has been pretty good I don't know what happened in , but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit Martinez, Egdar Last year a fluke or a portent NL Average Seitzer, Kevin AL Average Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year Any ideas Jacoby, Brook Brook is declining Hansen, Dave Magadan, Dave Jefferies, Greg Three first time regulars, above average in I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third Zeile, Todd Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder Each year he's about points below average And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this Baerga, Carlos Moving back to second was a good idea Hayes, Chris So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year Johnson, Howard Lansford, Carney Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford separated at birth To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year Lansford couldn't even break the mark without the help of the year of the glove Hollins, Dave Good hitter, but his fielding needs work Sheffield, Gary Not a good fielder Blauser, Jeff Fryman, Travis Both are better off at shortstop Gomez, Lee Two consecutive horrible years for Leo Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any Palmer, Dean Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever Congratulations, Dean Dale J Stephenson Grad Student At Large It is considered good to look wise, especially when not overburdened with information J Golden Kimball
