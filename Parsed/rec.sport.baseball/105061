From Paul Collacchi Subject Re Geronimo Pena In article r ejr , Dave Spencer writes In article r avINNb q cronkite Central Sun COM , Sun COM Bob Netherton writes In article A , writes Hey I've noticed that Luis Alicea is starting at nd for the Cardinals instead of Geronimo Pena Is Pena hurt, or was he just benched for poor performance Anyone know After a quick start, Pena has been stuck in a rut Torre gave Alicea the start to try to get Pena out of whatever funk he is in It has worked in the past And it has worked again Pena went for last night against Colorado Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real effect on his long term performance Sure, if a man is tired and needs real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act Perhaps if a man is mentally strained , then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax But I would like to suggest that in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant Paul Collacchi
