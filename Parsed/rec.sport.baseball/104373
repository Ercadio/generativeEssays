From Kenneth Arbeitman Subject Missing subject header In article Brian Landmann writes Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that and was day to only available as a Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea a hitter with no power as a pinch What the Hell is he See Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the Gilkey hit over last year what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every team in the At the beginning of the interview Torre also said Lankford is the one outfield guy who's in there no matter what My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low on base Whiten was a great decent offense and great defense in But don't worry Gilkey will be starting as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
