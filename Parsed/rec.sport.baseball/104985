From Dean R Money Subject The Braves will come To all the Braves doubters Don't The bats will come alive and the Braves will come The pitching is solid and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation they'll continue to pitch Heck with the five starters on the Braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five I hope this doesn't happen though The bats are Pendleton will certainly bat over Justice is catching fire Bream Nixon Sanders well there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much Right now the Cleveland Indians have players batting over But I certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven though wouldn't the Braves be something right now with their pitching and players batting over The well it IS But when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less So anyway I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this I'm not saying the Braves have automatically won the division but I'm optim istic about their season though it's awful painful to watch them at times right now Go Braves
