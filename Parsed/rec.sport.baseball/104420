From Robert Holt Subject Re ALL TIME BEST PLAYERS In article JOHN STEPHEN RANDOLPH writes In article bsu ucs writes I've recently been working on project to determine the greatest players at their respective My sources are Total Baseball James' Historical Abstract The Ballplayers biography word of mouth and my own biased Feel free to comment suggest flame whatever I tried to be as objective as possible using statistical data not inlcuded for time convience's I judged on BA Adj OPS Total Average fielding range runs total player rating Total Baseball stolen bases for curiosity's sake TPR g and years played Mike Schmidt Ed Matthews One t in Eddie Mathews George Brett Wade Boggs Ron Santo Brooks Robinson Frank Baker Darrell Evans Pie Traynor Ray Dandridge How can Brooks be I think he would at least be ahead of Ron Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near making up for the large difference in Their average seasons using their combined average AB BB per games Years AB H R HR RBI TB BB AVG OBP SLG OPS Santo Robinson Fielding we have per games at third Years P A DP E PCT Santo Robinson Even if Robinson's extra putouts assists and DPs are taken to mean he was responsible for more outs in the field that doesn't make up for the extra outs he made at the plate not to mention the fewer total The difference of in OPS should be decreased by about to account for Wrigley but a difference is still The Thorn Palmer ratings are Adjusted Adjusted Stolen Fielding Total Production Batting Runs Base Runs Runs Rating Santo Robinson Usual disclaimers about T P's FR apply but they really shouldn't be way off the mark in this At least it's better than fielding percentage Carney Lansford has a best all time but FR dead last of all Also since this total rating compares players to league average instead of replacement level Robinson should be awarded an extra or so for playing more He had a great career but I would prefer Santo's plus years of a replacement level But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan That's a similar story Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's superior Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better choices IMHO of course though some recent net discussion supports this point of CF Andre Dawson Shouldn't that be right field Bob Holt
