From Schwam David Subject Re Astros Are Back In article Marc Stephenson Keeping in line with the pessimists on the net I'll hold off on the Astros being all the way They could indeed contend but that would count on Atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems such as injuries or keeping up their early season abysmal While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation I feel that their relief staff may be They don't have a real closer although Mike Stanton saves has been used in that Didn't Stanton start off great last year and then falter Despite this your point is well Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team thus is unlikely to self For Houston to take 'em Atlanta needs to suffer some injuries particularly to their starting Astros relief corps holding If Doug Jones keeps his changeup effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then it's There's no reasonable left handed help and the middle relief is Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but he's been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him Doug Jones can lose his touch he went from Cleveland's all star closer to the minors in a pretty short From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of Art Doug Jones is the key to Houston's He must have another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL lousey closer to the minors in a pretty short Right A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling bit of shakiness at the fifth starter slot but that's basically normal Taubensee Anthony Gonzalez and Cedeno fulfilling some hitting Anthony appears to be about there Taubensee's swing looks a lot better this year solid knock against Expos last night Gonzalez is showing some early power and Cedeno still has the loopiest swing this side of Tim The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the club so Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting on Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to assume Biggio and Finley's Biggio concerns me since he usually starts the season very On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year's uniform There is talk that their road uniform will be traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the If I'm not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange McLane's favorite color is red I'm really the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound I'd like to see the uniform of the mid They may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and I liked end of the bargain remember two years ago a little relief goes a long way then they COULD win But I doubt I'll project them at Astros fan since the days of Staub Morgan Jackson Aspromonte Dierker Marc Stephenson IBM AWS Advanced Workstations Systems Austin TX DISCLAIMER The content of this posting is independent of official IBM INTERNET VNET MARC at AUSVMQ IBM T L Astros fan since the days of Ryan Scott Smith Cruz Davis Bass David Schwam University of Houston
