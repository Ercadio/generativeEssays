there are always tickets available! (though they are playing toronto,
and many toronto fans make the trip to cleveland as it is easier to
get tickets in cleveland than in toronto. either way, i seriously
doubt they will sell out until the end of the season.) -- doug bank private systems division motorola communications sector schaumburg, illinois 708-576-8207
