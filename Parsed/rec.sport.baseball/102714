From Chuck Chuck Bo Buck McMath Subject Re Giants' GM Quinn is a genius In article COM , chuq Apple COM Chuq Von Rospach wrote Chuck Chuck Bo Buck McMath writes When the Giants protected Mike Benjamin career average ovre pitcher Pat Rapp, there were surprised looks in the Bay Area Benjamin's stats , ab, H, doubles, dingers And Rapp's even been sent down to AAA So it's even better than that, eh Of course, the protected list was done by the OLD regime, not the new, so this is Rosen's baby, not Quinn's And I'll tell you what Let's look at this again at the end of the season, and, say in three years, and see who the genius is One of the more braindead decisions by the OldGiants, IMHO Even if Benjamin DOES improve markedly over the past and his hitting is better he's never going to be more than a utility backup IF Rapp might turn into a top flight arm in another year I think the next time I post something like this, I obviously need to make the sarcasm a bit more obvious chuck chuck mcmath MSD, Inc National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD No noose is good noose Hey batter, hey batter, hey batter, swing Anon This opinion influenced by cosmic radiation
