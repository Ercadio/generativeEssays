From Ken Kubey Subject Re HBP BB BIG CAT In article mjones fenway writes Ken Kubey writes And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, than because they have a great eye This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it Take, for example, Mark McGwire He walked times in If that's not a potential great example of what you're talking about then I don't know what is Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk of the time he made an out of the time he hit a single of the time he hit a double of the time he hit a homer Now, you're pitching against McGwire Would you trade walks for homers, double, singles, and outs I would Why give him the base when you can get him out times out of I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational I just said that it exists Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career OBP even though he's never had a batting average over he did hit in AB in or hit a single home run Yep, that's right, he's never hit a homer in AB's through the end of Who'd be afraid to throw a strike to him I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all Some questions How tall is he Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson Pete Rose Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler Does he take or strikes in each at bat It could be the Cole has a good batting eye Look above, I said that many high OBP guys draw their walks because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not all high OBP guys Ken Kubey
