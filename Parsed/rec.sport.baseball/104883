From Eric Roush Subject Re The Mystery of Ron Gant In article Forrest Smith writes In article Mike Silverman writes o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant omeone sure needs to analyze Gant is a head In his what six or seven years in the Majors he's put together a combined total of maybe one good season He lacks self confidence but worse he doesn't really understand Curiously he seems to perform best when his job is Sit him down for a game and he might get a hit the next But let him play and what is he thinking about Getting hits driving in runs No he's worried if he's going to get that stolen bases or that career home He appears to have no learning He never figured out how to play third base what a fiasco He still plays the outfield with his He's lucky he's so fast because it enables him to outrun his mistakes but as I suggested earlier in the season it looks to me like he's slowing down a little bit or else every groundskeeper is watering the infield dirt a little extra Gant has had way too much of a chance He may get hot again for a couple of months but he'll always revert to his true Gant's ML record Age this Year G AB BA OBP SLG HR SB CS Base year In the majors for parts of seasons total playing time approx Just looking at his hitting record he's had seasons of OPS greater than which is pretty good for an His season is pretty decent for a rookie The move to third base explains a lot of his When he returned as an OF he began hitting And of course last year he But no learning curve He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years as well as his SB CS As to his fielding he was an infielder when he was drafted a as he came up through the Braves system and then the Braves put him through position changes in the space of a He's an adequate OF although not great and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML I know you're another long term Braves fan About playing that's the most DIFFICULT position to field after At SS or you need more range and speed but at you've got to have quick reflexes and have a GUN for an There are NO second chances at even when playing sandlot softball Granted I'd still put my best overall infielder at SS but that's because he gets more chances not because the job is It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to But maybe that's because the supply of natural is Finally Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well and works hard to You don't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight Now whether he's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at But frankly if a player is going to not live up to potential I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard than by not trying hard You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult but at that age I don't believe you can teach All that said I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long term He's now and I think he's free agent eligible in years when he'll be Given his career curve and limitations I wouldn't expect him to last much past as a ML He might surprise me here but Atlanta's got some talent on the farm and I'd rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et Eric
