From Mike Jones Subject Re How does a pitcher get a save writes In article GEOFFREY E DIAS writes The subject line says it What is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save IMHO this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by today's rules in all of My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on deck Also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot excede three This is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don't understand but publicly admit to not In fact there's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than For the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save He must finish the game and either have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on have pitched at least three innings A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners savers For instance a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the Has this pitcher earned a win no But this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the Assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to The third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your Mike Jones AIX High End Development Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system Frederick Brooks The Mythical Man Month
