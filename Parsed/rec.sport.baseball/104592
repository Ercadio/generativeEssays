From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Pleasant Yankee Surprises In article Mark Singer writes I don't have a history handy but I don't recall that the preponderance of ROY's come from winning In fact I think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate Am I wrong Not really though I wouldn't personally say the most deserving candidate wins Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid season and there have been several duds in recent But this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything I If Amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive ROTY votes He's only he could have a long career ahead of him And he is not necessarily on a losing While the Angels' staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank Snow is playing Salmon is learning to make the Easley appears fine but even if he's not Flora is ready to come Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot Polonia and Curtis are steady and Even Myers and Orton are Personally I think they can finish over which makes them a winning I think they are a second division They should finish ahead of the Royals Mariners and possibly But I don't think they'll be above I think the East is stronger this Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was This year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty Even if Finley returns to form he won't replace what they lost in Sanderson Farrell I don't believe And while their BA may be good and they have decent speed their offense lacks They don't have any bona fide power Salmon Snow Davis and Curtis None with more than HR Cheers Valentine Which AL team had the most steals last week Those go go Tigers The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more balance in their You see they were scoring too many runs too Gotta run more to break that
