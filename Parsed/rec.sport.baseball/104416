Subject Re Braves Pitching UpdateDIR From David Grabiner In article David Robert Walker writes In article Neal Traven writes One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around and I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe or even Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats which wouldn't be that unreasonable and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first to third more No offense Gordon I wouldn't give baserunning that much The above effect is clear but there are other effects as If Olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold at Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar' Of course Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow No team in the 's ran much but some teams certainly had faster players than Still the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 's for all Bill James gives the Senators as an They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in stole bases with times caught Yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by Runs David Grabiner We are sorry but the number you have dialed is Please rotate your phone degrees and try Disclaimer I speak for no one and no one speaks for
