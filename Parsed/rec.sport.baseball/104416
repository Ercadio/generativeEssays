Subject Re Braves Pitching UpdateDIR From David Grabiner In article C L C LC murdoch acc Virginia EDU , David Robert Walker writes In article Neal Traven writes One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the split probably somewhere around and I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe , or even Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats which wouldn't be that unreasonable , and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first to third more often No offense, Gordon I wouldn't give baserunning that much value The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar's Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams No team in the 's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 's for all teams Bill James gives the Senators as an example They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in , stole bases with times caught stealing Yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by Runs Created David Grabiner, We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary Please rotate your phone degrees and try again Disclaimer I speak for no one and no one speaks for me
