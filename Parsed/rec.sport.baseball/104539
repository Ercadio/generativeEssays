From michael evenchick Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME In article Steve Tomassi writes Hi baseball fans So what do you say Don't you think he deserves it I mean heck if Dave Winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is Lee Smith ha then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my However I think you approached this the wrong I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman I feel they were all much better I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it IMHO Dave Kingman definately They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by I also do not think he did a lot for the I mean really I am a Met fan he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Dave Winfield I think He is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than Kingman's probably by quite a bit I also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some Lee Smith Maybe I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Darrell Evans Eddie Murray Maybe He has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role Are the stats good enough I am not sure but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as Winfield's Just think Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great Jeff Reardon My guess is no but it kind of depends on his Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long Big Well I strongly disagree Both of these guys deserve it for I talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by How many of those great plays saved games How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game While I believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of Let's be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so Save them for the guys who really deserve Face it if something isn't done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates the absurdity is Gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan Steve Garvey I am not sure probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for Jack Morris Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his Kirby Puckett The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a Nolan Ryan Is there really any doubt I think I heard something about him having some records maybe they were not all good I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number He has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments no hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and I really hope he gets ALL the possible So in summing up I have groups those that belong those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should Yes Winfield Yount Brett not in your mail Smith Puckett and Ryan Maybe Murray and Smith No Reardon Garvey Morris Evans and definately Kingman As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my Mike Q Steve
