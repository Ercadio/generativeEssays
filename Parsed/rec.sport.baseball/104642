From Ron Graham Subject I am right No I am right was Re BOB KNEPPER WAS DAMN RIGHT In article Eric Roush In article Glenn Tanner writes No but I am for starting for people who respond to obvious Nah let's reserve for people who POST obvious flamebait like I didn't realize Tanner brought up Bob Knepper Pam Postema in the first Thought it was someone named If someone posts something as controversial not to mention idiotic as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup someone should challenge the Why If a statement is truly idiotic and is universally thought so the challenge is a waste of Further challenges that have nothing yes nothing to do with baseball are wasting others' You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks Let's hear it in some sort of categorical Actually I question whether either Knepper or Postema aren't old news at this point although what I have read of Postema's book is There is a school of thought that suggests that silence I agree this Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly SHOULD apply to a forum of public Sez If you've been reading lately you'll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings albeit in an edited It's making me think a little more carefully about some of the things I That does not come out in what you say down the road In conclusion if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that I don't read He's got the right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name of free But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his Even elementary school children have had access to our postings albeit in an edited You want them to hear you talk like this Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same Or do you want them to think you're some politically correct demagogue who's oh so sensitive Ho Plus you're here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that I don't What You got a problem with what Jacobs says what Knepper thinks all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas more and better Yours is the easy way As for Knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't pre They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women they pop some question about An interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same Off the top of my head I guess If my guess is right Knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him and Postema gets a book for it and he doesn' Now of course you don't have to read any of And if you want to cut down on flames then DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT You don't have to respond to flames Saves cyberspace Now why didn't I think of that RG I can play me better than There's only one of Barry Bonds on playing himself in two movies
