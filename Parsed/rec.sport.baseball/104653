From Roger Maynard Subject Re Jack Morris In David DeMers writes In article Roger Maynard writes The facts are that Morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning Clemens hasn' What does it take to play on a WS winning club We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu tion from the rest of the team' There is only one way of determin ing best in And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the Each game determines which team is the best that At the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the The playoffs determine the best of the But the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams Not the individual There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual And that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely that player A's team would have played better with player B in their Sheer Impossible to If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual's contribution to winning the WS because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base So until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham pionship more than Morris your evaluation of Clemens is totally sub jective and is mere I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne The fact is that Morris didn't win any ballgames Toronto did in spite of Morris' contribution This has been explained to you The Jays won with Morris And Boston wins with Clemens I am not saying that Morris is better than I am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp You don't have to be You are completely consumed by the post hoc ergo propter hoc For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy Ignoratio I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings although I have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past I am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual's performance from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per The stats are a nice hobby and that's about There is no new knowledge being So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying cordially as always So many rm so little
