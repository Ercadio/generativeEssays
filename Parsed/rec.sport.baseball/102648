Subject Re Bo was a good player you shorts plus idiots From In article David Robert Walker writes BO JACKSON KCR KCR KCR CWS MAJ MAJ This is what Jackson looked like in with everything converted to a neutral park on the basis of run His equivalent average started at in was up to in and in So let us say he had established in his last two seasons a level of I'm not quite sure how these numbers are It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs Or do they What is equivalent average One thing when looking at Bo's stats is that you can see that KC took away some Normally you expect some would be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples But Bo despite his speed hit very few doubles and not that many So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral That is Very good in But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the The best EQA in the AL in was Dave Winfield's Thomas was first at First in the NL was Bonds an incroyable tenth was Bip Roberts But is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter it is about what Mattingly had in what Felix Jose had the last two years just ahead of Time Raines' five year average better than Ryan Klesko's Felix Jose has been a player in a fairly neutral I would offhand guess the Bo at around a Maybe Not even He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his That is the basis for the about him being The media would have you beleive he was a great I think he was a good maybe very good He was IMO something like the best hitter in the I'd put him about there Note I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only so so at He did only have one hr rbi season and KC wasn't Note I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the SDCN's as they are known on this group with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton and perhaps others We find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly Their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good I imagine the more recent the player has left college ball Now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of Sometimes a player with poor MLE's Dave Justice the Ventura becomes a Some hitters develop Shane Mack Brian Downing some don't Oddibe McDowell Mickey Brantley This error involves real things there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane It may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so But still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing Their backgrounds are What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background Is there some reason to believe that a Bo or a Deion or a Lofton or a Tony Gwynn or an Ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two sport It hasn't been established that you can't but then statistics is after all an art I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Look at those good but not great minor league numbers they Well what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half year in Atlanta than Then again it might Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor MLE' But you guys DON'T What's worse you don't know that you don' And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about injuries and lifting and wheaties You seem to think that the model is perfect and It's It's got some Oh Bill Guilford still thinks hairy butt is truly ugly might be right
