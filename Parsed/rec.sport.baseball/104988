From Edward Ted Fischer Subject Re Bases loaded walk gives Reds win in In article Mark Singer writes Actually I think the large scale sample size is part of the It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell The X axis being the deviation in clutch hitting non clutch the Y axis being the number of Certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the Most My supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players This may be the root of the Please consider the following hypothetical with an open Note that I am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at Suppose we have a simplified Lotto You pick a number from and win if that number is Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every In the first year of the game approximately of the population will win or more In the second year of the game of those time winners will again be time In the third year of the game of those who won or more times in each of the first two years will win Suppose I started with people in my After three years I have people who have consistently in each of the last three years won or more the number of times Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game Because we know there is no skill Nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of But suppose we don't know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or How would we test this hypothesis We can look for correlations in the Now most of the population will show zero But our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they aren't very good psychics they should still manage to win or more times most years Net result A small positive correlation over the entire This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity Is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base Well zero correlation is zero You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last But if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain The length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next Is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks Now if it were true that of all three year streaks remained true to form then we might have something But then we wouldn't have zero Instead we have of all three year streaks remain true to form and of all three year streaks reverse You look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split each I completely accept that Again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis Then we would have something And we would also have a positive But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then Cheers Valentine
