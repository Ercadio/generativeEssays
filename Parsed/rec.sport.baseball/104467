From Charles M Kozierok Subject Re Jack Morris In article SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes In article Edward Ted Fischer writes In article Greg Spira writes Howard W Howard Wong writes Has Jack lost a bit of his edge What is the worst start Jack Morris has had Uh Jack lost his edge about years ago and has had only one above average year in the last Again goes to prove that it is better to be good than You can count on good Lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a bad finish last year Yes I am enjoying every last run he gives Who was it who said Morris was a better signing than Viola Hey Valentine I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their cheap Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his who cares he had two of them before he came to Toronto and if the Jays had signed Viola instead of Morris it would have been Frank who won and got the and he would be on his way to this year Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best your logic is curious and there is no reason to believe that Viola wouldn't have won as many games had he signed with when you compare their stupid W L records be sure to compare their team's offensive averages now looking at anything like the Morris Viola sweepstakes a year later is basically but there were plenty of reasons why it should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher based on previous recent years and also based on age Frank is almost years younger how many knew that people got caught up in the ' World Series and then on Morris' wins last wins are the stupidest most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than RBI or that he won just means that the Jays got him a lot of the only really valid retort to Valentine is weren't the Red Sox trying to get Morris too oh sure they said Viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say And don't tell me Boston will win this They won't even be in the top in the division more like if this is true it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares charles
