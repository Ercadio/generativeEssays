From genetic David Tate Subject Re Young Catchers Mark Singer said In article genetic David Tate writes Well perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in But they do have others worth playing at least in their Catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play Olson and Berryhill instead I disagree in that I don't think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership I don't deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but I really don't see any way that we could ever know who they Nichols's Law of Catcher Defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very Don't know Nichols' A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of Thus Mickey Tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short The rule doesn't apply to perceived superstars who get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect Greg Olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't Don't believe in catchers' But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different Aren't they the same thing In other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be Either that or just I presume we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta no Of Is it fair to the young players Does it make organizational sense I think it Well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their I mean please don't tell me how to run my Especially when I'm being One could make the same sort of argument in other Pete Rose in pursuing Ty Cobb's record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet The Reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of Eric That may be good business but that doesn't mean I don't loathe them for David Tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than Pete Rose's dy cummings nobody not even Tim Raines has such soft hands
