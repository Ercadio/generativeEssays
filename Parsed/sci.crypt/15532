From Net Noise owner Subject Re Facinating facts bit serial number possibly fixed and The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block and are then used as keys to triple encrypt producing a bit block E D E Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce and and two additional bit blocks and are computed E D E E D E and are then concatenated together giving The first bits are assigned to and the second bits to The rest are The unit key U is the XOR of and and are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely Or should I say the need to access the Escrow houses to decrypt the The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion of protection and small town cops won't be let in on the secret so they will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses but the fact is the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit keys from the encrypted serial number 'Nuff
