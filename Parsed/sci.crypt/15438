From Tim Russell Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any Geoffrey Kuenning writes It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have This chip had to take years to develop yet already we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on No The most recent post I saw in and I hope anyone interested in this topic ends up there states that Clipper has been in development for over four I am however more than a little PO'd that Clinton put his name on this monstrosity or even allowed it to get out the door for that He's already heard from me and I hope you'll all take the time to voice your extreme displeasure as Tim Russell Omaha NE
