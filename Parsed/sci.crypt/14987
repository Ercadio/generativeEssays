From Stephan Neuhaus HiWi Mattern Subject Re PGP general comments Stephan Neuhaus HiWi Mattern writes Lots of I hate to follow up to my own posting but I should perhaps clarify some things so I won't get First of all when I'm talking about factoring the modulus'' or a breakthrough in factoring'' what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every I also have to admit that I don't really know if the non group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key I have thought about it a little while but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group That of course means nothing at Then I wrote Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus than it is to generate it the increase in computer speed alone will keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock step people will simply start using longer moduli and still be What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come because even if bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers not with a new algorithm then people would simply use longer Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same Hope this keeps the flames Have Stephan sig closed for Please leave your pickaxe PGP public key available on Note the expiration
