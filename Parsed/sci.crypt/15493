From Mark Riordan Subject List of large integer arithmetic packages This is the file from last updated April In response to Email requests I have assembled this list of large integer arithmetic packages of which I have Most of these are C function libraries available in source For your convenience I have placed copies of some of these on They are available for anonymous FTP in the directory pub bignum However what I have may not be the most current version in all Here they are in no particular order mp Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes Multiple precision package accessed via lmp flag on your Provides gcd exponentiation Comes with SunOS NeXT Mach BBN Mach and probably a few See man mp Object code only of PARI Henri Cohen et Universite Bordeaux I Paris FRANCE Multiple precision desk calculator and library Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola semi optimized code for SPARC and apparently rather slow generic C Does both integers and Does vectors and matrices as well as Contains a number of advanced functions some of which I've never heard Weber's function Has a factorization function primality test other related Plenty of TEX Public domain but you can't distribute modified Available via anonymous FTP from There seem to be Mac and NeXT specific versions there in addition to Filename pari Arithmetic in Global Fields Arith Kevin Coombes David Grant Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or polynomials over finite Includes basic and a few others like Source code in Distributed under the terms of the GNU public Includes man pages and TEX Filename Arbitrary Precision Math Library Lloyd Zusman Los Gatos CA C package which supports basic Provides for radix points non integers Not as polished as the others Posted to in October Filename BigNum Vuillemin INRIA FRANCE and Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab DECPRL A portable and efficient arbitrary precision integer C code with generic C kernel plus assembly kernels for Intel MIPS Pyramid and of course This is probably one of the better known packages of this Implements mod plus logical operations OR AND Both signed and unsigned arithmetic Available via email from You will receive shell Give your postal address and you will also receive printed documentation from Package includes TEX Publicly available for non commercial I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL doesn't like others to distribute However BIGNUM is distributed as part of ecpp see below Lenstra's package Arjen Lenstra Bellcore Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in Includes exponentiation mod primality testing sqrt random number generator and a few The package was uncommented and undocumented I have tried to add enough comments to get This is the only of these packages that I have actually It works well and is very I haven't done any benchmarks against the others but the code looks clever Lenstra is an accomplished number Unlike the other packages here this one requires you to allocate storage statically only a problem if your numbers are really Arjen has placed the code in the public Filename lenstra Arjen Lenstra Bellcore An improved version of Arjen's package This one does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation which can be turned off as an option Has a few new routines lenstra contains minor bugfixes to the previously available lenstra and lenstra Filename lenstra bmp Brent's Multiple Precision Brent vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating fixed point Includes most of the mathematical functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run time This code is an ACM algorithm number To obtain send a mail message to containing the line send from bmp or better yet perhaps just start with help SPX Kannan Alagappan Joseph Tardo DEC This is a huge prototype public key authentication system based on I mention it here because those who have heard of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from You can get a beta test copy of SPX from Use it only for testing as it may expire on a certain I don't know whether this has expired amp Antti's Multiple Precision Antti Louko Multiple precision integer package in Includes pow mod x mod y random sqrt Available for non commercial The package includes share secret a public key system based on the Diffie Hellman This is normally part of the well known des but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with cryptographic export laws and have named the result Filename gennum Per Bothner U of Wisconsin Madison C routines and classes to do generic arithmetic both integer and Formerly available on However it seems to have MIRACL By someone in Dublin Ireland Integer and fractional multiple precision Includes factorization primality testing Not public domain It is available from the Austin Code See ads in Byte Magazine or precision Dave Barrett Multiple precision integer package in C with sqrt rand mod pow Simple vector Does dynamic allocation of Free as long as you don't sell it or any program that uses Filename UBASIC Yuji Kida Rikkyo University Nishi Ikebukuro Tokyo Japan Multiple precision version of the BASIC programming language for MS Includes floating Said by Keith Briggs to be pretty Object only I says This is the best package that I know of for fast Has a version optimized for Includes routines to do MPQS the fastest currently known general factoring An additional file is at both sites to allow MPQS to use hard drives so that it can factor up to Many number theoretical functions are included in It allows over digits of Available via anonymous FTP from or or calc Unknown MS DOS C like language that allows infinite Nice intrinsic reports problems when changing precision on the See or briggs arith Keith Briggs Turbo Pascal source for routines that do multiple precision sqrt gcd factoring rand for integers also includes and rand for rational Filename briggs Institute fur Experimentelle Mathematik Dr Gerhard Schneider Fast C multiple precision subroutine I don't know anything about it says to contact for more Postal Address Institute fur Experimentelle Mathematik EllernStr Essen GERMANY LongInt Markus Mueller Multi precision arithmetic written in MODULA with the most time critical parts written in Includes basic arithmetics as well as arithmetics MODULO a An additional module provides a collection of procedures for primality testing gcd multiplicative inverse and The package is part of a Privacy Enhanced Mail PEM package which includes a PEM mailer RSA key generator and Certificate generation Source is in Modula C and assembler for Sun LongInt has also been ported to MS DOS under Logitech Modula and Turbo Availability free for university use research and education otherwise a source license is To obtain write or email to Markus Mueller Bertastrasse CH Dietikon Switzerland email bignum Bignum package written in portable Will in the future conform to the Common Lisp functions that handles Currently includes exponentiation exptmod comparison random numbers and Filename bignum GNU Multiple Precision GNU Free Software Foundation multiple precision I haven't looked at it This is current as of April but there may be a more recent version by the time you read This package is very widely available on FTP Filename gmp Elliptic Curve Primality Proving Francois Morian Large package to prove the primality of any Includes Inria's BIGNUM Obtained from Filename PGP Pretty Good Privacy Philip Zimmermann Intel based crypto package that includes bignum routines in C said to be quite fast for Intel Unix and Mac versions also The crypto package violates RSA patents but the bignum routines can be used without fear of legal Bell's Arbitrary Precision Calculator David Bell Australia Arbitrary precision calculator with good online help C like language many builtin functions support for integers rational numbers they work like floating point complex numbers matrices strings lists files objects Includes gcd primality testing even trig Large package Obtained from Filename calc Built in support in other languages Various Multiple precision arithmetic is available in a number of programming languages such as Lisp and ABC Perl by Larry Wall available from includes source in Perl for such a package but it's probably not suitable for serious For some of these source code may be This list is long enough so I'm not going to pursue it Thanks to Ed Vielmetti and several others who contributed to this Mark Riordan
