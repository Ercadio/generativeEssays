From pat Pat Myrto Subject New Clipper Chip Proposal from the I saw this article posted in a local I haven't seen it or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups which I subscribe So I am posting it here so others can read it check it out and comment on it and provide ideas for handling these sorts of I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article but if accurate I find it extremely disturbing especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license or to register a car and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards wiretap proposals and One simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits BTW reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been promoting in an even more disturbing That said with no further comment the article follows Begin included article Note This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from in directory pub nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other A state of the art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government The chip represents a new approach to encryption It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of A key escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding Each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace and the need of companies to manufacture and export high technology The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to This infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the Further information is provided in an accompanying fact The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations A Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Q Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the What would they have to do to decipher the message A They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow Q Who will run the key escrow data banks A The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data Q How strong is the security in the device How can I be sure how strong the security is A This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized Q Whose decision was it to propose this product A The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet Q Who was consulted The Congress Industry A We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this Q Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces Q Who provides the Clipper Chip A Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the Q How do I buy one of these encryption devices A We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices A This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption Q What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration A It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware A Voice encryption devices are subject to export control Case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these The same is true for other encryption One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to companies operating at home and With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these End included article
