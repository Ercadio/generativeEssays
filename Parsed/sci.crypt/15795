From Robert Lewis Glendenning Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security There are chips which perform the voice compression They can't be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses voice grade circuits to save the cost of long distance leased or satellite I can't remember the generic term for these My impression is that this was a big deal years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that it isn't done much Lew Lew Glendenning Perspective is worth IQ Niels Bohr or somebody like that
