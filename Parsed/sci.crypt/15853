From Steven Bellovin Subject Re Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate In article CMM Jon lnes writes A person I know belonging to a research lab of a rivate company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in minutes to an He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an extraordinare kind I The attack was possible because of the amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small This was two years DES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive For a lot of purposes however it is still very This sounds an awful lot like a password guesser not a weakness in Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper that came out about years ago in both Computer Communications Review and For that matter it was loudly discussed on the Kerberos mailing list even The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES and everything to do with bad password I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks possible on I'm quite dubious that private research labs know And the parameters of a brute force attack are quite well established see for example the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the July ' You're not going to do it in an hour with only rather powerful DES hardware'' I'll leave the arithmetic as an exercise for the On average you'll need to do Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs and for how many such engines are
