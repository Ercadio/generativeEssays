From Hal Finney Subject Re Steve Brinich writes Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and not a real RNG This turns those in a kind of bottleneck for system The only theory that makes any sense is that and are either the same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers about one billion multiplied by the number of different My interpretation of Denning's description is that and are chosen randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each chip programming I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly there would not be a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some people have My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the and using a specified algorithm provides an in principle checkable way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers used to generate the Since we have to trust the escrow companies anyway it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from random seeds entered by the escrow And since the algorithm for key generation is public modulo Skipjack secrecy then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure ask for and to be exposed and run his own independent calculation of and to verify that that is what is actually being put onto the And yes there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could be hard to The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the and entered by the trusted escrow Back doors in the chip could allow U to be Heck each chip could be recorded with the same U ignoring what was on the Hal Finney
