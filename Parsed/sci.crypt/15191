From Vesselin Bontchev Subject Re text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption Clipper Chip Announcement writes The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built in trapdoors just like the Feds For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law Bla protect electronic mail and computer While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other Indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the an ordinary It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use This doesn't say There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted Except from the At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip they'll use something This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use agencies to decode messages encoded by the When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a That is the government has the It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of It does however provide those Americans with the false sense of In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their If the screening is not public it cannot be Some people do not trust DES even today after all the examinations only because some parts of its design were kept The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal In order to assess technology So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal So will those law abiding citizens who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes Except from the the need of companies to manufacture and export high technology Huh Later it says that the new technology will be export Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the In short the new technology can Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual It cannot Protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who handle them Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for Q Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations A Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of However it does not provide them that much privacy as it Q Who will run the key escrow data banks A The two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data Two candidates the NSA and the Q How strong is the security in the device How can I be sure how strong the security is A This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available That is trust us While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow Security through obscurity system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized If it's not entirely open to public examination it cannot be Besides who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same Q Whose decision was it to propose this product A The National Security Council the Justice Department the The NSA and the FBI Q Who was consulted The Congress Industry A We have on going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this Why did they forget the Academia Q Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces Doesn't this smell to monopolism Q Who provides the Clipper Chip A Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the Like the Mafia Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices This is the main question why was it buried at the end A This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy The key escrow We'll see mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one Trust us The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have In short If we decide to outlaw strong crypto we'll tell you effectively done nor is the saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption There is a Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms why is not every American entitled as a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product A It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and The proposed technology provides a false sense of security encryption devices with built in capabilities for breaking the encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and is a step to outlaw strong Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware A Voice encryption devices are subject to export control Case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these The Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices OK I'm not American it's not my business but I just couldn't resist to The whole plot looks so It's up to you Americans to fight for your Regards Vesselin Now is the time for David Sternlight to pop up and claim that the new system
