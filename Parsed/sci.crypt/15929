From Steven Bellovin Subject Re Clipper considered harmful In article C John Kelsey writes The clipper chip's User key is formed by E D E E D E E D E Why is the triple encrytion used Is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch If so why use bit keys Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm it's not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess Why are and formed as they are It would be facinating to see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd Where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form come from Are they changed from chip to chip or session to session Even if they're published in the NY Times if SkipJack is resistant to known plaintext attacks when using triple encryption then there's no break in But why allow that kind of weird format If those three bit values are truly random bits then maybe it's used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on SkipJack if it exists can't be easily used to derive and for a whole production run of these I can't answer all our questions in detail but I can take a stab at The form the operations that compute and is of course the famous triple encryption'' suggested for use with It's much stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other It's recommended for anything of very high And I think we can agree that the R i and S i fit that Why n n and n Well you need different plaintext I have no idea if they'll be disclosed or At a guess they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a bit change but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns and there might conceivably be a So the n i values are and I'm guessing chosen to increase the Hamming In any event I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S i from the U i let alone Observe if the NSA has U they don't need to find S But even if they do they can't get U and U In theory they should never even see those values even with a The real question I think is why use this scheme at all as opposed to a hardware random number My answer is that this is much more Look suppose that NSA NIST the ACLU the EFF and the NRA combined to build a really good random number generator and that it passed every test you could think When you come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that well Have any components changed in value Have the components been changed out from under you Does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting bits Yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it again but that's Consider on the other hand a software You bring your own floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums It's a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other Yes I can think of ways to cheat software I think that they're a lot There are three issues with The first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of My answer with one significant exception is I really do think that NSA and NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under certain carefully controlled circumstances with a minimum risk of The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a programming That's seriously U and U should be loaded onto the chip To those who disagree and I don't claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions section of my technical analysis paper I had originally blasted the scheme I issue this invitation assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due What would you do differently In answering this question please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap some domestic users is If you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I present Right here I'm discussing just the technical And no I don't by any means claim that just because something can be done it should The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't mean that that's the only way they'll be Maybe the NSA will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping And they'll generate bogus warrant requests so that the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never Sorry guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple DES phones Who'd 'a' thunk it '' I have no answer to this question and at the moment I don't see a way of answering Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the I think that the answer is no but it's not a no I'm a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that I explained at great length on the net in the Elder Days and that I don't have the energy to repeat But that means that I'm willing to accept that some laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of The government already has the ability and in our system the right to issue search warrants and while that power has certainly been abused it's also been used quite properly and fairly in other Is key escrow sufficiently different I think so but again it's not an easy question for It is easy for libertarians to answer of course since Clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their oft admirable And it's also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group I'm much more distant Steve Bellovin
