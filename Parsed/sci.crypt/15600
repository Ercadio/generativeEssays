From Robert Eachus Subject Re Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip Steven Bellovin writes Thousands Tens of thousands Do some arithmetic Skipjack has possible Let's assume a brute force engine like that hypothesized for DES microsecond per trial million That's trials per second or about years for Well maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build a machine with million Sure only years for each But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as Building a brute force machine to test possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is One chip one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks and that break gives you all messages involving that The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement but notice that XORing with truely random bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow Using for XOR SK for the escrowed key and A and B for two random bit strings hand SK A B SK A and SK B to three escrow It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern for example of such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no Robert Eachus with Standard Disclaimer use Standard Disclaimer function Message Text in Clever Ideas return Better Ideas
