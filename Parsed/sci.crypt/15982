From Marcus J Ranum Subject Re Let's build software cryptophones for over the Graham Toal writes I'm not sure if my xposting to made it to here too but I've found that a low sample rate samples sec at bits per sample plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into with a simdgen left This is definitely worth working on And shorten works in well under real I don't think that this should be worked on just in the context of That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts of What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone quality speech Imagine if you will a little box that takes data on its serial port and puts out sound and takes sound and codes it to signals on its serial Full Now this device is not a cryptographic It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever you want to call It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications for a speech synthesis with a few nifty libraries and some samples b speech recording for electronic messaging c building voicemail systems d internet talk radio e internet relay chat Of course some of the electronic messaging in item b might be encrypted possibly realtime but that's the user's One would need of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout to switch over and some code on say a I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive internet talk radio could be Ideally though it should be a general purpose It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody should be able to balk at its widespread Obviously to make it easy for homebrewers it should use pretty common It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple of folks about building such a thing before this whole clipper thing I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are able to make sample units given incentive and some I'd envisioned finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund development of a public domain board layout and parts set that could be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD packages and in Anyone interested I'll start a provisional mailing Let me know if you want
