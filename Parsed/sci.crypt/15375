From Steven Bellovin Subject Re Clipper chip technical details In article A , D J Bernstein writes Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says There is a global key G, plus one key U C for each chip C The user can choose a new session key K P for each phone call P he makes Chip C knows three keys G, its own U C, and the user's K P The government as a whole knows G and every U C Apparently a message M is encrypted as E G E U C K P ,C , E K P M That's it The system as described here can't possibly work What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M the receiving chip needs K P to get K P the receiving chip needs U C The only information it can work with is C If U C can be computed from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key escrow'' is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted Via K P, of course Nothing was said about where K P comes from It's the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose session keys exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow header when you do
