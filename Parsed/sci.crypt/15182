From Marc Thibault Subject Re PEM and MIME In article qg m Edward Vielmetti writes I would suggest that attractive MIME formatted news messages a day would be sufficient to get a few people thinking about adding MIME support to news readers, esp if the content is really worth it But that's just the problem There is no such thing as MIME Formatted By analogy, MIME is a content labelling standard for the box, not a specification for the contents themselves It provides a standard for like minded individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed upon data format You say tomahto, I say tomaeto you say postscript, I say SGML Cheers, Marc Marc Thibault CIS , Put another log NC FreeNet aa on the fire BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK Version mQBNAiqxYTkAAAECALfeHYp yC s ScFvJSpj eSCAO hihtneFrrn vuEcSavh AAUwpIUGyV N n lFTPnnLc Ms c PJUPYKVI ABRG I hcmMgVGhpYmF bHQg PG hcmNAdGFuZGEuaXNpcy vcmc HLnv END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
