From Bill Stewart Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any For example I don't own a cordless With Clipper I If the local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order pizza I'm no worse off than I am now and I don't have to worry about local kids or nosy I do tend to So where can I buy a DES encrypted cellular phone How much does it cost Of course if we didn't have government monopolies on cellular phone service there probably would be some How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to The Second Amendment is especially apt given the ITAR definitions of crypto equipment as munitions and the gun control people's increasing ability to define things as assault weapons and make them Triple DES is obviously used for assault phones while Cripple will be legal and Triple Cripple may fall into the gray area of illegally upgrading to an assault phone Pray for peace Bill Bill Stewart AT T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ No I'm from New Jersey I only work in White House Commect Line fax
