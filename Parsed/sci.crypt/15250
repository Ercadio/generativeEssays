From Timothy May Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any Brad Templeton wrote It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as I understand the I could be wrong but I've seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed As the EFF noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one bust leading to incrimination in other But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved This is the main concern of most of us I The camel's nose in the tent And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically archiving large This was one of the main objections to the proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide easy access for the One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them Do we want anyone to have this kind of power Tim May whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime Timothy May Crypto Anarchy encryption digital money anonymous networks digital pseudonyms zero knowledge reputations information markets Aptos CA black markets collapse of Higher Power Public Key PGP and MailSafe
