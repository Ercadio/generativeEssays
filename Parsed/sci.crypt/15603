From Peter Ilieve Subject Re Clipper Chip and crypto key escrow Excerpts from the Clipper announcement with some questions the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens Q Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the What would they have to do to decipher the message A They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow In these two sections the phrases or other legal order' and normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal What is are these How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system The second section shows the sequence of The law enforcer armed with his warrant attaches his headphones to the line with his croc clips remember these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony and hears a load of modem like tones we are talking analogue telephony here What next What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units these are supposed to be cheap mass market items and using them in How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices where phone line quality may well be It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware A Voice encryption devices are subject to export control One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to companies operating at home and With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications This raises an intersting question in the Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called It has been stated either here or in the group that they will not approve equipment that does I don't know if this is true or not but this would make a good test Perhaps friendly' countries and the UK may still qualify will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as Peter Ilieve
