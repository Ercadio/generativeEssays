From Steven Bellovin Subject More technical details Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note courtesy of Dorothy Again this is reposted with Two requests first note the roles of and It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit And the nature of the generation process for and is such that neither can be produced Thus the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half key and another generates the That is Second these postings are not revealed scripture nor are they carefully crafted spook Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings as opposed to say the official announcements of Clipper Leave Denning out of this given Hellman's record of opposition to DES which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read I don't think you can impugn his Oh yeah the folks who invented Clipper aren't If you think something doesn't make sense it's almost certainly because you don't understand their Steve Bellovin Date Sun Apr EDT From Dorothy Denning Subject Re Clipper Chip To a long list of folks I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI so let me add a few comments to Marty's message The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in The algorithm operates on bit blocks like DES and the chip supports all DES modes of The algorithm uses rounds of scrambling compared with in In addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as Call this key plain old When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and Any method public key can be used to establish the session In the AT T telephone security devices which will have the new chip the key is negotiated using a public key encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E E M K E K UK serial number SK My understanding is that E M K is not encrypted under SK called the family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this I will also check it out but this is Sunday so I did not want to The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two bit random numbers and UK which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the serial number N as Let and be bit blocks derived from N and let and be two bit seeds used as Compute the bit block E D E Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two Similarly compute blocks and starting with and I'm unlear about whether the keys and The fact that they're called seeds suggests they Then and are concatenated together giving The first bits form and the next bits form The remaining bits are Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for Please pass them to me along with your In addition to Marty's criteria I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive Some suggestions I've received so far include SRI Rand Mitre the national labs Sandia LANL Los Alamos Treasury When a court order obtains and and thence K the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link Aside It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box which will have been keyed with for the wiretap When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over blank signed forms every Levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps No single person does at least for FBI After completing a mound of paperwork an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the Attorney General for final Dorothy Denning
