From Hal Finney Subject Re Clipper chip technical details Bernstein writes Summary elided The system as described here can't possibly What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M the receiving chip needs K P to get K P the receiving chip needs U The only information it can work with is If U C can be computed from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key escrow'' is Otherwise how is a message decrypted The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the key management Either the K P is the secret key corresponding to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation or it is the result of a Diffie Hellman key exchange or something Either way there must be some protocols beyond those described It isn't clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must be provided by other system Hal Finney
