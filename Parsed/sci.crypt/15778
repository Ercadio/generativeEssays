From David L Cathey Subject Re The secret source of that announcement In article gradyC uAMw BnG netcom com , EF writes Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator Minutes, followup comments to other participants, and so on could be posted to the alt encrypted group for the use of the people who attended Communiques intended by the group for non attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted I like it PGP would be useful, I guess Although I don't have a working version for VMS yet EF E AD D D C F FC AC F D F E F David L Cathey INET Montagar Software Concepts UUCP montagar davidc P O Box , Plano TX Fone
