From Graham Toal Subject Re Is key escrow enough The points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust Even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of and seeds rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to bits I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the and values they are feeding into the and are clearly the backdoor we should assume they are all If they're not compromisable why the hell not use a hardware true random number There isn't a random number source anywhere in this The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the Nope it can't be This is all about two levels of access the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use and ostensibly the FBI and the back door that lets the NSA decode everything on the fly and maybe some back handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for G
