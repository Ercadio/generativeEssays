From Burt Kaliski Subject Pseudocollisions in Following is a short note commenting on den Boer and Bosselaers' recent work on the message digest Feel free to email questions or further Burt Kaliski RSA Laboratories documentstyle article begin document title On Pseudocollisions'' in the Message Digest Algorithm author Burton Kaliski tt and Matthew Robshaw tt and RSA Laboratories Marine Parkway Redwood City CA date April maketitle A message digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a digest'' of fixed length and has three properties Computing the digest is easy finding a message with a given digest inversion'' is hard and finding two messages with the same digest collision'' is also Message digest algorithms have many applications including digital signatures and message RSA Data Security's message digest algorithm developed by Ron Rivest cite rfc maps a message to a bit message Computing the digest of a one megabyte message takes as little as a While no message digest algorithm can yet be em proved secure is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps to a bit Inversion should take about operations and collision should take about No one has found a faster approach to inversion or Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers cite den boer presents a special kind of pseudocollision'' in 's internal compression function which maps a bit message block x and a bit input state s to a bit output They show how to find a message block x and two related input states s and s that yield the same output state f x s f x s Their well thought approach exploits structural properties of the collision function to find a pseudocollision in about operations much less than one would Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of are not While a real collision in implies a pseudocollision or a pseudo inversion'' a pseudocollision need not imply a real Indeed a real collision since it involves two different messages would almost always involve em different message blocks x and x such that f x s f x s but the pseudocollisions have the same message Moreover the input states s and s would generally be unrelated but the pseudocollisions' input states are the same except for four There does not seem to be any way to extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the special pseudocollisions a limitation they readily It is reasonable therefore to believe that remains While den Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions and not anything approaching real Further research of course will give a better understanding of the strengths of and other message digest algorithms with the eventual hope that such algorithms can in some sense be proved bibliographystyle plain begin thebibliography bibitem den boer Bert den Boer and Antoon newblock Collisions for the compression function of newblock In it Advances in Cryptology Eurocrypt ' newblock bibitem rfc newblock it RFC The Message Digest Algorithm newblock Internet Activities Board April end thebibliography end document
