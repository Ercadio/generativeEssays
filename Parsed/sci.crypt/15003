From Ray Berry Subject Re Hard drive security for FBI targets Ross Anderson writes In article cuffell Tim Cuffel writes This suggests a new PC security product design approach first fill the hard drive with random files and files encrypted under a number of known Then whenever a new secret file is created you delete a random file and replace it with real encrypted New non secret files are encrypted under a known Better yet instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system take it a step Write yourself a minimal file system program that is used to create delete files en decrypt them to ramdisk list a Put the util password protected on a The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file Instead defrag your disk thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file Or leave a small partition on the disk that is not assigned to Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files DOS system files for instance Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file Now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your disk at all Ray Berry
