From ameline Ian Ameline Subject Screw the people crypto is for hard core hackers spooks only I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies the chip is so much garbage and will need to be I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the backdoor If I were to manufacture such a chip as part of my marketing strategy I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage and then publicize the doing my best not to be connected with such activities which would likely not be legal Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly Any back doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow the market demand for a secure I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community but lots of I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs little to Regards Ian Of course the ramblings above have nothing to do with my employer nor do I necessarily advocate doing any of the things described here I just believe that the events above are likely to take place
