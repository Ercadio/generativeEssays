From Stephen Tate Subject Re Why the clipper algorithm is secret In article John Levine writes It just occurred to me why the algorithm is If it were published one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper But the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow Not necessarily they could release the details of the algorithm without releasing the system key called SK by Hellman That would make most people happy and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange the official chips would only work with other official In other words secrecy of SK makes physically identical clone versions impossible secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be Of course revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK since all units share this key compromising it may be a big Personally I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one secret bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my Of course compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system is compromised but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true with a secret Incidentally what's to keep a secret algorithm from using the secret SK as the main key with UK being only marginally Then a court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a Steve Tate The reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem of Computer Science above all other sciences is that its laws are Duke University absolutely certain and indisputable while those of all Durham NC other sciences are to some extent Einstein
