From Vesselin Bontchev Subject Re Secret algorithm Re Clipper Chip and crypto key escrow David Sternlight writes Though some may argue about the nose of the camel it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled If it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file As usual David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to The proposal clearly states The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications It speaks about telecommunications in Read it again Maybe you'll understand it the next Nah probably encryption then it IS an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break That's exactly what the government wants all sheep minded people to Let's look at the current It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and I mean secure encryption is What will happen when if Ha the new proposal gets accepted Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed The proposal emphasizes on the former almost nobody which is clearly an improvement and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed Yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto You think that it will not happen Good Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to It's not just continued ability It's guaranteed Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let's focus on Yeah that's exactly what your government wants you to Let's take small steps one at a Concentrate on the current one don't think about the Trust One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the They unlike you read what they Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless Yes it It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping It will allow only to the government to If the scheme is secure of course which is yet to be But how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow The new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop Hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed is that mentally Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure I guess that comes from the background of working some years for the two major crypto evaluating companies right Gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method for David Sternlight has already done all the job for This would meet the needs of businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement Trust us we're from the Government and we're here to help Most legitimate corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in I see no difficulty in creating a reliable Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety do not deserve This or something like that I don't have the exact quote but the meaning is the same has been said by one of your great Maybe you should study their works more carefully if you have the brains to understand them of From my point of view this is a fair starting There are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the But in The main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the Gee if the proposal was saying we guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal as just a default voluntary implementation there would have been much less For some reason they didn't even try to promise you I wonder Was Orwell off only by years return we get access to high security No in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and While the above is just rumors and while even if it is true it is not done easily the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two It might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right Or who has only one of NSA also told you that DES is secure why don't you simply trust them huh There is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so It doesn't have to It is guaranteed to be easily breakable just get the It might be even easier but until there is some evidence this is just a wild be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys The trapdoors are In government's The pursuant to a legitimate court Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court Legitimate And who decides what communications are legitimate Oh I guess it's the government right The guys who already have the keys It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide who has the right to use it legitimately In discussing this let's try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous Impossible since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence and ignorance as in the provious This is a substantive and technical issue and personal remarks have no place in such a Unfortunately I have yet to see you posting a technically competent
