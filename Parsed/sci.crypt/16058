From Edward Anthony Hutchins Subject Re Let's build software cryptophones for over the internet Hmmm CELP takes up about MIPS for full duplex, and has been implemented on about a million DSP chips the card in my PC only cost about , and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop The Analog Devices board that we're looking at now cost about academic price I don't think hardware is something to worry about if you get it working, people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow What we need here is a good implementation of CELP the government code is absolute crap, I got a speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours , and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress decompress bit frames every msec I think the AD should have enough juice for this MIPS As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode I gotta find the source to pgp and see how tough it would be to integrate the en decryption parts into the code I'll play with it Anyone else out there got an AD setup Ed '' ,, '' ,, see lidflip instructions on Edward Hutchins, other side of card
