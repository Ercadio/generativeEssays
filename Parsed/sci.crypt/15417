From Germano Caronni Subject Re More technical details In article Steven Bellovin writes Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note courtesy of Dorothy Again this is reposted with Two requests first note the roles of and It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit And the nature of the generation process for and is such that neither can be produced Thus the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half key and another generates the That is Second these postings are not revealed scripture nor are they carefully crafted spook Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings as opposed to say the official announcements of Clipper Leave Denning out of this given Hellman's record of opposition to DES which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read I don't think you can impugn his Oh yeah the folks who invented Clipper aren't If you think something doesn't make sense it's almost certainly because you don't understand their This is an addition posted with permission to some details of They enligthen the use of and for Date Mon Apr EDT From Dorothy Denning Subject Re Clipper Chip I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features of Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on The name of the encryption algorithm is Martin Hellman had written and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E E M K E K UK serial number SK To which I responded My understanding is that E M K is not encrypted under SK called the family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this I was correct in that E M K is not encrypted under However Skipjack being a single key system there is of course not a separate decrypt key for the family key The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the serial number N as Let and be bit blocks derived from N and let and be two bit seeds used as Compute the bit block E D E Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two Similarly compute blocks and starting with and I'm unlear about whether the keys and The fact that they're called seeds suggests they Then and are concatenated together giving The first bits form and the next bits form The remaining bits are The seeds and do not The whole process is performed on a laptop computer and and are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows The same and are used during an entire programming session to generate keys for a stream of serial Everything is discarded at the end the computer could be thrown out if desired The serial number is bits and the values and are formed by padding the serial number with fixed bit blocks separate padding for each value The resulting keys and are output onto separate floppy disks paired up with their serial Each pair is stored in a separate The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow Dorothy Denning I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes Please remark that in posting this I do not automatically agree with it's contents and So don't swamp my mailbox I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising And no I don't mind if you call and 'backdoor' as I could imagine the key generation process working without these seeds and the dependency of from the Serial Friendly greetings Germano Caronni Instruments register only through things they're designed to Space still contains infinite PGP Key ID Germano Caronni
