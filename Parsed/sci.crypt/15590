From Marc Conrad Subject Re List of large integer arithmetic packages Mark Riordan writes not very comprehensive list deleted There is a very comprehensive list in which detailed descriptions of many Especially you Mark should update your list Here it is Available Systems This is the list of currently developed and distributed software for symbolic math No informations is supplied on systems no longer being supported like SAINT FORMAC ALPAK ALTRAN MATHLAB SIN SAC CAMAL ScratchPad MuMath SHEEP TRIGMAN ANALITIK SMP or For more detailed info on any of the systems below look into the directory
