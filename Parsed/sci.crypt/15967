in *all* systems within the range of the device. a long time ago i built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at something like 4am, which had just enough range to cover my room and his.
however something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and tv reception. this isn't going to make you many friends. incidentally, an older-model trs80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin> peter.
