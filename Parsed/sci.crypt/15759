From David Koontz Subject Re new encryption From THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised April The chips are programmed by Mykotronx which calls them the MYK The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented Information Facility which is essentially a The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the About chips are programmed during a single The SCIF is located at ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION This article is based on information provided by NSA NIST FBI and Permission to distribute this document is So who is Mykotronx It would be nice to know that they were not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the Trusting the fox to guard the chickens and all Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are While we are at it the chip design s should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon regardless of the security level of the encryption It would be a shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip when all I'd know is that someone rang and when I attempted to go off hook the line went Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect directly to a The design examination should be done to the gate Does anyone have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon The model would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised Tip offs would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence is not I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used and its possible that might be noticed but could be edited from the I think the silicon itself needs to be Imagine a design done in two layer metalization yet finding a third layer under the The government is asking for a lot of blind trust the encryption algorithm operating protocols the agency having physical control of the devices the silicon I'd feel like keeping one hand on my
