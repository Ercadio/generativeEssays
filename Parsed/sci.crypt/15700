Subject Re How large are commercial keys From Peter Gutmann In Dane Butzer writes What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms I know DES is bits tripple DES is bits and IDEA is Is there anything made in the US that has bit keys Anything anywhere that has larger keys I've heard that can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere My MDC cipher which uses any one way hash function as a CFB mode stream cipher the current implementation uses uses a key of up to bits that is you can use a bit key if you want and copy it over the entire bit range or you can use the entire bits Runtime is independant of key size the system runs slightly slower than I presume and use a similar system or possibly they just hash an arbitrary length key down to n bits maybe using something like
