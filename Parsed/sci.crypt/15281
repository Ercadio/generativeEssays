From Subject powerful similarity too A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous agrep a fast approximate pattern matching tool source code project available from in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search The one most obviously applicable to cryptography key selection is to be able to specify the similarity of matches in the For example say you make up a password phrase of Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word But how close is it to en entry that could be varied by some crack program to brute force search for it You use agrep to find Looking with argument for none one or two errors no Good so But agrep bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern is too close to the pattern imsel part of himself and a host of others to be of any cryptographic value as a An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like teh for the A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as least level in order not immediately ruled out as even a remote possibility of being a good In real cryptographic use my personal passphrases clear at least level on my rather large meg word and phrase And for searching for key words in human typed data lots o' typos the tool is For example For example say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book Neuromancer in the huge SF Lover's Even with an error distance specification as small as of I will find all those people who think the title was Necromancer or other common Why miss anything Also the program can look for up to patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer Moore sublinear Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name terrorists names special Tagalog or religious words in the news or e mail spool You can even search for ciphertext by using say random three byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi square 'birthday' hits on message size You think some crypto terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you No Try agrep p NSA to find NSA National Security Agency NSecAg No Such Agency National Scrabble Association N S A You can also specify fixed areas looking for license plate when you know that the letters are correct you might say agrep XYZ licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors addition substitution deletion in the number You can also weight the relative cost for substiutions additions or deletion For example when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination you might know that some kinds of damage cause the A nucelotide to drop out more than other you could adjust for this bias by setting Dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c A steganographic use I even used agrep steg eograp E just now to find the correct spelling would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the hits into a useful For example agrep d From 'PGP passphrase Zimmerman NSA ' says output the entire mail record delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase' 'Zimmerman' or 'NSA' And agrep has been measured an order of magnitude faster than the second best similarity tool publicly As usual I will be glad to e mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e mail IF they cannot do an anonymous Get this It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the Grady Ward vendor to the NSA and proud of it AD FC AC
