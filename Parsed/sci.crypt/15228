subject re pgp, pem, and rfc's was cryptography patents from arthur rubin in jonathan eifrig writes >fact: it is unlawful to distribute code implementing rsa without a license
>to do so from pkp, whether or not one is charging for it. furthermore,
>any use of rsa, other than for research purposes allowed under us patent
>law, is similarly unlawful. therefore, the "average citizen" cannot use
>rsa to encrypt message traffic in the us without a license from pkp. wrong: i don't think even pkp claims this one. it is not unlawful to
distribute code implementing rsa. it appears to be unlawful to use it, so
i agree with your last sentence. >fact: there are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
>us law, although this is beginning to look like it will change. the only
>impediments to widespread use of rsa cryptography in the us are pkp's
>patents. yes, that's correct.
