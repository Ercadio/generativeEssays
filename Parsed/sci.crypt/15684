From David Koontz Subject Re Will FEDs troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks The M code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission You would need a large number of them but hey there's supposed to be millions of these things right Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be I just had the thought that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks for session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as the session key The proviso that you don't mind your own serial number being denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission block reflecting the law enforcement block it better not fall on bit block If it were a recognizeable datum you could lie with it I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK I remember reading that Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon hence the ability to put it You ever think that Mykotronx sounds like one of those made up names of companies used as fronts for intelligence organizations
