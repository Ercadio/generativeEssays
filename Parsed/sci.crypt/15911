From Graham Toal Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security There are chips which perform the voice compression They can't be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses voice grade circuits to save the cost of long distance leased or satellite I can't remember the generic term for these My impression is that this was a big deal years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that it isn't done much They have to get about compression on bit samples to squeeze them down I played around with the lossless 'shorten' program last night but it only managed I've got some specimen CELP code but it's not obvious that it runs in real time I think it's just proof of concept code and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before I can put my own sample through Looks like the current option is to use a voice mail modem with built in DSP chip to do this in That means two modems for a system putting the cost at Maybe soon we'll be able to do it in software on high powered games consoles isn't the an Acorn RISC machine inside That cpu runs like shit off a and will be nicely mass market G
