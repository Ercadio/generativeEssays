From Graham Toal Subject Re How does it really work was Re text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption From Marc VanHeyningen The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals The language sort of suggests this but it's hard to I'd lay a few bucks that its just data in data out in I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the I'm sure it's purely a digital The back end will come later but I'm positive it won't be left to the manufacturers they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true bwahahaha G
