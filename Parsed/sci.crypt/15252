operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear A block cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next The notion of product ciphers is due to Shannon Examples of modern product ciphers include LUCIFER DES SP networks LOKI FEAL PES Khufu and Khafre The so called Feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each LUCIFER DES LOKI and FEAL are examples of Feistel The following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds LUCIFER DES LOKI FEAL x x PES What makes a product cipher secure Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random'' For example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the Meyer has shown that at least rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a In this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing'' function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear The fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as S For example LUCIFER has S boxes and DES has S The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these S A list of partial design criteria for the S boxes of DES which apply to S boxes in general may be found in Brown and Brickell et What are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers Let E be a product cipher that maps N bit blocks to N bit Let E K X be the encryption of X under key Then for any fixed K the map sending X to E K X is a permutation of the set of N bit Denote this permutation by P The set of all N bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S N The collection of all these permutations P K where K ranges over all possible keys is denoted E S N If E were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E S N to generate a large subset of S N Coppersmith and Grossman have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group A N given a sufficient number of The alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even'' permutations all permutations which can be written as an even number of Even and Goldreich were able to extend these results to show that Feistel ciphers can generate A N given a sufficient number of The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a Multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys there does not exist a third key such that E E X E X which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys is equal to a single encryption under the third key If for every there exists a such that is true then we say that E is a This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was extensively studied by Sherman Kaliski and Rivest In their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a In fact DES is not a group What can be proven about the security of a product cipher Recall from above that P K is a permutation produced by E under some key The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P K appears to be a random element of S N the symmetric Let R be an element of S N selected We will say that P K and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P K and R in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial That is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by E the optimal decision is no better than simply Luby and Rackoff have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size There are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well The standard modes of operation are defined in the Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS published in See the question about ECB below for more Although they are defined for the DES block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since But one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that See ANSI and FIPS for a standard method of message authentication using What exactly is DES DES is the Government's Data Encryption Standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit It is defined in FIPS which supersedes FIPS FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm DEA defined in ANSI What is triple DES Triple DES is a product cipher which like DES operates on bit data There are several forms each of which uses the DES cipher Some forms use two bit keys some use The DES modes of operation may also be used with triple Some people refer to E D E x as triple This method is defined in chapter of the ANSI standard Financial Institution Key Management and is intended for use in encrypting DES keys and IVs for Automated Key Distribution Its formal name is Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key Pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as That standard says section Key encrypting keys may be a single DEA key or a DEA key Key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed the data protected by the key s has a long security life A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single Others use the term triple DES for E D E x or E E E x One of us Carl Ellison keeps advocating DES triple use in the form E TRAN E TRAN E COMPRESS x where each DES instance has its own key and IV for CBC mode and TRAN has been posted on It is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own What is differential cryptanalysis Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping any mapping which is based on a repeated round function The method was recently popularized by Biham and Shamir but Coppersmith has remarked that the S boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some years This method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably FEAL Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts Y Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X X' satisfy a known difference D X X' where is componentwise In the basic Biham Shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for Substantially fewer pairs are required if DES is truncated to or In these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many known The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling observations on the Most importantly if the key schedule was removed from DES and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than Thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to Further the S boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential Adi Shamir is quoted to say NYTimes Oct I would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was '' How was NSA involved in the design of DES According to Kinnucan Tuchman a member of the group that developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using The NSA did not dictate a single wire '' Tuchman and Meyer another developer of DES spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in They then spent two years strengthening Their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions IBM has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms ' explains '' On the other hand a document called Involvement of the NSA in the development of DES unclassified summary of the United States Select Committee on Intelligence'' printed in the IEEE Communications Magazine states In the development of DES NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the S box structures and certified that the final DES algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical '' Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman presented Is DES available in software Several people have made DES code available via ftp see part for pathnames Stig Ostholm FTPSO BSD FTPBK Eric Young FTPEY Dennis Furguson FTPDF Mark Riordan FTPMR Phil Karn FTPPK A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson FIPS says The algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented using hardware not software Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this Despite this software implementations abound and are used by government Is DES available in hardware The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to

departments and agencies for the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following conditions apply cryptographic protection is required and the data is not classified according to the National Security Act of as amended or the Atomic Energy Act of as What are ECB CBC CFB and OFB encryption These are methods for using block ciphers such as DES to encrypt messages files and blocks of data known as modes of Four modes of operation are defined in FIPS December and also in ANSI FIPS specifies that when bit ASCII data is sent in octets the unused most significant bit is to be set to FIPS also specifies the padding for short The four DES modes of operation are Electronic Code Book ECB Cipher Block Chaining CBC K bit Cipher FeedBack CFB and K bit Output FeedBack OFB These methods are explained below in a c language like Some symbols P n The n'th block of plaintext input to encryption output from Size of block determined by the C n The n'th block of ciphertext output from encryption input to Size of block determined by the E m The DES encryption function performed on bit block m using the key schedule derived from some bit D m The DES decryption function performed on bit block m using the same key schedule as in E m except that the keys in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E m IV A bit initialization vector a secret value which along with the key

encrypt and This disproves the erroneous claim that systems which feature E but not D cannot be used for data confidentiality and therefore are not subject to export
