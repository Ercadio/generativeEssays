From C John Kelsey Subject Clipper chip and key exchange methods I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked how does the Clipper chip exchange keys If the public key is only or bits long does anyone know of any public key schemes that are secure with that key size Diffie Hellman or maybe El Gamal with p set to a constant value Presumably the real scheme is something like Exchange verify public Send encrypted randomly generated session Encrypt Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream Can anyone elaborate on this or show me what I'm missing here John Kelsey
