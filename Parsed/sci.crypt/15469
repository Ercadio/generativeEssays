From Perry Metzger Subject Do we need the clipper for cheap security Amanda Walker writes The answer seems obvious to me they wouldn' There is other hardware out there not DES as an example triple DES as a better So where can I buy a DES encrypted cellular phone How much does it cost Personally Cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good system right A standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a DES chip a integrated modem module and a small processor to do glue work are all you need to have a secure You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast With integration you could put all of them onto a single chip and in the future they can Yes cheap crypto is good but we don't need it from the You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be When the White House releases stuff saying this is good because it gives people privacy note that we didn't need them to give us privacy the capability is available using commercial hardware right Indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are Were it not for the NSA and company cheap encryption systems would be As it is they try every trick in the book to stop Had it not been for them I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right They aren't the ones making cheap crypto They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's When they hand you a clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage your prize for having traded in your And what did we buy with our birthright Did we get safety from foreigners They can read conference papers as well as anyone else and are using strong Did we get safety from professional terrorists I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine most of them can't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade Are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves No because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography Perry Metzger Laissez faire laissez Le monde va de lui
