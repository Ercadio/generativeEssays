From Robert Lewis Glendenning Subject Don't fight Clipper Chip subvert or replace it Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business or professional body in a position to establish a standard and provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop Large companies in the voice data comm business are out because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure If we as professionals in crypto organizations EFF were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission and getting our companies to implement it we might avoid government Otherwise I think it will happen to us by Gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong They are strong enough and we may be foolish enough to push through the Clipper Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this I for one would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure If not this we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented in either SW or HW and publish it then push to make it the defacto standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming We are opposing charging the We should be nimble and The gov is strong not Lew Lew Glendenning Perspective is worth IQ Niels Bohr or somebody like that
