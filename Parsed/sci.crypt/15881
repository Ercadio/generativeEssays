From Perry Metzger Subject Is this overreaction Jerry Han writes As one of the happily sleeping people I would just like to ask this aren't people just slightly overreacting to this Or are we all of a sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia The point of the matter is that yes this is a serious But it is not the end of the Guess what We're doing something now you can't do in a Communist country or Nazi We're complaining about it or rather you're complaining about it and nobody is shooting at We would like to keep it that Thats the By reacting strongly and forcefully now we will assure that we continue to remain You cannot overreact to a threat like The worst that happens if we overreact is that we waste time and The worst that happens if we underreact is I prefer overreaction GUESS WHAT PEOPLE You live in one of the few countries in the world where a person can complain without getting shot Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain ourselves in this state of even moderate I suggest that overreacting now and in the future is a good Perry Metzger Laissez faire laissez Le monde va de lui
