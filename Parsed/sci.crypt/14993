From Vesselin Bontchev Subject Re Licensing of public key implementations David Sternlight writes I will provide one hint it is reported that RSA expressed puzzlement at their conference that nobody has asked for permission to use RIPEM to write a PGP compatible program This actually supports Bill's speculation IF there is a backdoor in RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA, then it is more than natural that they will welcome ANY public key implementation that uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY implementation that doesn't I personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a long precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source, but, of course, the fact that I cannot see it means nothing Regards, Vesselin Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg Tel , Fax Fachbereich Informatik AGN PGP public key available on request Vogt Koelln Strasse , rm C e mail D Hamburg , Germany
