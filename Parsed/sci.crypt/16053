From Marc Thibault Subject Re Organized Lobbying for Cryptography In article A Dwight Tuinstra writes Great slogan I'm ready to sign up with a crypto lobbying effort though I wouldn't want to do it through an NRA offshoot Shall we also push for the CRA Cryptographic Rights Amendment Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North, it looks like you could do worse than get the NRA involved They have a kindred problem, a large number of voters, the right attitude, and lots of funds From an ethical or constitutional viewpoint, I haven't seen a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesn't also support the NRA position on guns and vice versa Cheers, Marc Marc Thibault Automation Architect CIS , R R , Oxford Mills, Ontario, Canada NC FreeNet aa BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK mQBNAiqxYTkAAAECALfeHYp yC s ScFvJSpj eSCAO hihtneFrrn vuEcSavh AAUwpIUGyV N n lFTPnnLc Ms c PJUPYKVI ABRG I hcmMgVGhpYmF bHQg PG hcmNAdGFuZGEuaXNpcy vcmc HLnv END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
