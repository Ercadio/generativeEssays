From Philip Zimmermann Subject Fighting the Clipper Initiative Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high profile They are serious about it It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill in Possible actions to take in response Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list and Work the Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology Write to your favorite trade Better yet write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad Remember to tailor it to your The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist even if you are Lobby Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district as well as your two US Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology Talk to those Involve your local political The Libertarian party would certainly be There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal spanning all parts of the political We have many natural The The Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR assuming these groups will fight this They need money for legal expenses and Mobilize opposition in Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it from within and from If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this Write persuasive memos to your management with your name and your colleagues' names on Hold meetings on Publicize deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno monkeywrenching apparatus as you That means PGP anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP PGP key servers The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this We don't know yet how tough this fight will be so we may have to compromise to get most of what we If we can't outright defeat it we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan and articulate how we want it Philip Zimmermann
