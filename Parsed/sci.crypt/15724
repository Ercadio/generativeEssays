From Clipper Chip Announcement Subject Re The secret source of that announcement In article Harry Shapiro writes In Jurgen Botz writes Even more interesting the SMTP server at no longer recognizes the 'expn' and 'vrfy' telnet smtp Trying Connected to Escape character is ' ' sendmail NIST ready at Tue Apr EDT expn clipper Command unrecognized Seems like sombody didn't like your snooping around Then it is a good thing we already have this The csspub mailing list and address on rest of names deleted my version of 'rn' asked me whether I really want to send this posting You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly I am the administrator of alias It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams which includes a number of world wide incident response teams such as CERT CC and other places in As to the VRFY and EXPN commands they are normally disabled since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O S files same old story our backups weren't especially As you can guess I didn't remember to re disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper When I saw people's names posted here I felt it was time to clear things So EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet I posted them from an account called ' ' I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board set up under law of the Computer Security Act of and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography security and privacy I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named It is not a source for information it was set up solely to monitor any initial Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias I've already apologized to them for what's Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice albeit unfriendly to some and any effect of disabling it again was John Wack
