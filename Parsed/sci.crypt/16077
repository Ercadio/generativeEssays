From Axel Dunkel Subject Summary How sensible is DES towards bit errors Hi I'd like to thank you all for the fast Special thanks go to those who replied lexical order Marcus J Ranum mjr Paul Crowley Paul Schlyter tarnold Todd Arnold Bill Stewart My question was how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key How much of the DES encrypted data is affected depends on the used encryption According to Marcus J Ranum mjr there is cfb cipher feedback mode ecb electronic code book mode cbc cipher block chaining mode ofb output feedback mode each mode does some stuff better than ofb and cfb are designed for communications streams more than for Unfortunally people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction of all of the following Sure seems that some modes will resync quite fast others will never others will even only effect the very Summarized people said concerning this matter In CBC mode only the current block will be affected tarnold Todd Arnold If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data will be destroyed as Paul Schlyter In CFB mode DES synchronizes quite fast probably within block according to Maracus J Ranum mjr Maybe someone definitely knows what happens in which mode Nevertheless Thank you all very much Axel Dunkel I include the responses I got From tarnold Todd Arnold In cat Axel Dunkel writes how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key It depends on the mode you're For a single bit input block a one bit error will have a percent chance of corrupting each of the output bits in other words it essentially turns the output block into a random If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the one bit block will be The next block and all that follow it will be decrypted It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are Todd From Paul Schlyter In article cat you write Hello how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key At least bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is in If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data will be destroyed as DES is VERY seisitive for single bit This is as it should Paul Schlyter Swedish Amateur Astronomer's Society SAAF Nybrogatan A tr S Stockholm Sweden InterNet From Paul Crowley how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key Probably very bad you might lose the rest of the data If you want safety against dropped bits use an error correcting coder like the freeware GNU o Paul Crowley Trust I know what I'm X Fold a fish for Jesus From how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key It depends on the mode you're using DES Electronic Code Book ECB takes a block of input bits and produces output bits so if any bits are changed the entire block of bits becomes I forget which feedback mode is In all of them the results of encrypting one block affect later With some modes the system self synchronizes so errors are repaired in a few With other modes once one block is bad all later blocks will be bad There's also the framing If you have a bit change the block that it's in changes and maybe later blocks also But if you have bits lost or bits added bits in or bits out everything is confused after From Marcus J Ranum mjr depends on the mode you're cfb for example synchronises pretty figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the next Experience is what you get if you don't get what you Systemberatung Axel Dunkel Koenigsberger Strasse D Kriftel Germany E Mail Voice Fax
