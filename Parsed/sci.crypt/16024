From Bill Stewart Subject Re Clipper considered harmful Restated and amplified In article David Koontz writes Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super An automated full system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F can validate Clipper wrappers and N ESN associations but it cannot reveal in realtime the use of super encryption unless it knows all unit keys which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces upon specific wiretap like The serial number will be in a bit block with a bit Doesn't take a lot to check to see if that is Depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy but susceptible to replay or variable timer counter random which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the inquisitors to know if they've missed messages or gotten them out of sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care It is still easy to conceal super encryption at least until the inquisitors get ahold of the K key which can take a while presumably not in near real Worst case in which the escrow agencies provide the U key to the local cops still only gets one side of the conversation per warrant unless the same key is used for both directions which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist Pray for peace Bill Bill Stewart AT T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ No I'm from New Jersey I only work in White House Commect Line fax
