From Danny Weitzner Subject Re inventing Crypto Policy An EFF Statement April INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new However EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been Apparently the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security The so called Clipper Chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid The encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications This proposal raises a number of serious concerns First the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an The NSA developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure Other vendors or developers may have better Furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other Rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open Second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert Third while the use of the use of a split key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to In sum the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and However the Clipper Chip solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL ESCROW The bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold bits of each The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow A key is tied to the device however not the person using Upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement According to the Presidential Directive just issued the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow Some in the Administration have suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps the Federal Reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS The Administration claims that there are no back doors means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified In order to prove this Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap The results of the investigation would then be made The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole source secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms VLSI and NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four The manufacturing contract was let months GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER In order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this Users will include the FBI Secret Service VP Al Gore and maybe even the At today's Commerce Department press briefing a number of people asked this question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law The items to be considered include export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Unfortunately however the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is Some public involvement in the process has been promised but they terms have yet to be FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT Jerry Berman Executive Director Daniel Weitzner Senior Staff Counsel
