is cryptology Cryptography Plaintext Ciphertext Encryption Key The story begins When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn't trust the So he replaced every A by a C every B by a D and so on through the Only someone who knew the shift by '' rule could decipher his A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the Cryptography is the art of creating and using Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you're not supposed to be able Cryptology is the study of both cryptography and The original message is called a The disguised message is called a Encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into Decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of The algorithms are labelled the labels are called For instance Caesar probably used shift by n'' encryption for several different values of It's natural to say that n is the key The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called Other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third What references can I start with to learn cryptology For an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well However these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than The Codebreakers by Kahn is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid ' Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines or Sinkov This is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in Consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have The book of Denning gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of Similar comments apply to the books of Price Davies and Pfleeger The books of Konheim and Meyer Matyas are quite technical Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in the development of DES and both books give a thorough analysis of Konheim's book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical Meyer and Matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and The books of Rueppel and Koblitz concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to How does one go about cryptanalysis Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and The best available textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still Modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete These are not the traditional fare of the Computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key What is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance In a nutshell If f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible That's brute force Example Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn't know the He can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is Every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered For example DES which has been in use for over years now has or about possible A computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid ' The situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor Massively parallel machines threaten the security of DES against brute force Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned The unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous A system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is If a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong Certainly Many weak cryptosystems looked good at However sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical If Joe can break this system then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring '' See part Failing that it's a crap If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis'' the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the For instance he might assume cribs'' stretches of probable If the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the Or he might exploit isologs'' the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several Thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn't have a Sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are The one time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once Even chosen plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been See Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break Some don't know any Often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a
