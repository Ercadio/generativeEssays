From Subject Cryptography FAQ Digital Signatures Archive name cryptography faq Last modified FAQ for part Digital Signatures and Hash Functions This is the seventh of ten parts of the The parts are mostly independent but you should read the first part before the We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail so don't Notes such as '' refer to the reference list in the last The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to as pub usenet cryptography faq part xx The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups and every Contents What is a one way hash function What is the difference between public private secret shared What are and What is Snefru What is a one way hash function A typical one way hash function takes a variable length message and produces a fixed length Given the hash it is computationally impossible to find a message with that hash in fact one can't determine any usable information about a message with that hash not even a single For some one way hash functions it's also computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the same A one way hash function can be private or public just like an encryption Here's one application of a public one way hash function like or Most public key signature systems are relatively To sign a long message may take longer than the user is willing to Solution Compute the one way hash of the message and sign the hash which is Now anyone who wants to verify the signature can do the same Another name for one way hash function is message digest What is the difference between public private secret shared There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of When an algorithm depends on a key which isn't published we call it a private algorithm otherwise we call it a public We have encryption functions E and decryption functions D so that D E M M for any message We also have hashing functions H and verification functions V such that V M X if and only if X H M A public key cryptosystem has public encryption and private Checksums such as the application mentioned in the previous question have public hashing and public Digital signature functions have private hashing and public verification only one person can produce the hash for a message but everyone can verify that the hash is Obviously when an algorithm depends on a private key it's meant to be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the There's no real difference between a shared'' key and a private key a shared key isn't published so it's If you encrypt data for a friend rather than for your eyes only'' are you suddenly doing shared key encryption'' rather than private key encryption What are and and are message digest functions developed by Ron Definitions appear in RFC and RFC see part Code is available from FTPMD Note that a transcription error was found in the original draft The corrected algorithm should be called though some people refer to it as What is Snefru Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph Snefru is an round function the newest in the Definitions appear in Merkle's paper Code is available from FTPSF
