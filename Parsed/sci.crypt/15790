From Tauren N Mills Subject Thoughts and questions I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about cryptography but a couple things came to mind while reading through the Is the Clipper chip going to be exported If not how will people communicate with other countries Will they have to do that in un crypt Will other encryption techniques be legal assuming the government cracks down on using others when going overseas but not within the states I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted PIN based on the time The host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a Is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time The systems would then allow a window of time around this instant where the key would I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just But for smaller scale things it might Could some similar method be used to make the two bit keys that are issued to police FBI etc to tap a phone only usable for one week for instance If further surveilance was needed they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another This would make it useless for local police to database keys they have I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the But any thoughts on the subject Thanks Tauren Mills Tauren Mills
