From tarnold Todd Arnold Subject Re How sensible is DES towards bit errors In cat Axel Dunkel writes how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key It depends on the mode you're For a single bit input block a one bit error will have a percent chance of corrupting each of the output bits in other words it essentially turns the output block into a random If you're encrypting data in CBC mode however only the one bit block will be The next block and all that follow it will be decrypted It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are Todd
