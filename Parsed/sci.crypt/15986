From pat Pat Myrto Subject Re Overreacting was Re Once tapped your code is no good any more In article Shaen Bernhardt writes In article Jerry Han writes In this giant bally ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E mail and posts I've tossing back and deleted A circut court judge in Illinois once said When dealing with a government that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means to parry this attack on personal Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar The point More and more I see the government slowly washing away Even Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth Do you think I will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they can keep track of what I'm saying Even if there is no evidence of my guilt Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind I'm tired of There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to the public and I am I am I am perhaps even of this country could care less about the clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton The problem is the people are not having the scope or implicataions pointed out to Hell most haven't even heard of Clipper and when they do it will be in soothing language telling everyone how nice the government is at 'letting them have' How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper decision The provisions of the Crime Bill The abuses of Civil Forfeiture The government uses polls to support percent of the people want gun bans yet the same pollsters have determined according to the media that percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of rights are going on When they find out when it hits them it will be too One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their time probing searching researching For example how big a percentage of the average population even has access to USENET Way less than percent I How many outside of Internet USENET are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing or have been exposed to arguments of both sides of the issue What the public will get is only ONE side The Government's THAT is This saddens and frightens I am a conserveative believe it or A law and order But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the intelligence of the American Tell them it's going to keep them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you put cameras in their How can the bulk of the people be informed when the media refuses to do it Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly totalatarian Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed It is not meant to be used in This is the difference between self defence and To be quite honest the way things are going I'd call it self Let's try to avoid killing things eh There's enough blood shed in the world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars I'm probably But what I've read scared me a I don't want my children growing up in a War And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera hours a The people at large need to be BUT HOW I am but one I try to talk to everyone that will listen but I can hardly make any kind of Without prejudice UCC Pat Myrto Seattle WA If all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat WISDOM Only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the Albert Einstien
