From jru Jimmy Upton Subject Rubick Shortest Path Algorithm Status What is the expected run time a factor of on a using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path solution for Rubicks Cube from a randomly chosen position I have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks Cube but I don't believe this question has been Notice that I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the SHORTEST path not just any It seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program would need to do a brute force search though That seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to know if someone has significantly improved on I have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem but before I spend to much time developing them I wanted to know if someone else has already done the ADMINISTRIVIA I have posted this to three groups and attempted to set the followup to which seems to me to be the place to continue this I will cross post a summary when and if it becomes Email replies gladly Jimmy jru
