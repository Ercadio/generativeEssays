From Marc VanHeyningen Subject RIPEM Frequently Noted Vulnerabilities Archive name ripem attacks Last update Mar SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using RIPEM for secure electronic It does not go into great detail and is almost certainly not Obviously many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic Even a standard key about bits with RIPEM is long enough to render this impractical barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with It would not allow an attacker to claim to be DES has only bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one Since each message has a different DES key the work for each message would remain KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking To safeguard it it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived from a passphrase you type However if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted So don't do Run RIPEM on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of Ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else has physical access Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real If the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them It is important to get the proper public keys of other The most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given a fair amount of The strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is not always Having other people vouch for you by signing a statement containing your key is possible although RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as RIPEM does generate and check fingerprints of public keys in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for PLAYBACK ATTACKS Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause For example suppose you send a message with MIC ONLY a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection to Alice which says OK let's do Your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to Bob who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do Of course he may interpret it in an entirely different Or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at a later Or the opponent could change the Originator Name to himself register your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown To defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date A good front end script for RIPEM should do this automatically IMHO As a recipient you should be sure that the Originator Name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that the message is not an old Some this also can and should be The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils LOCAL ATTACKS Clearly the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is For example under UNIX a super user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depending how it's In addition the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is an extension of If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust In the extreme case RIPEM should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so However there's a very real trade off between convenience and security A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of course executable on a floppy Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the RIPEM decryption However the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you've just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure This will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my security arrangement in my next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in Some people use two keys a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the However once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she There exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC ONLY message signed by you and readable by anyone although RIPEM does not provide this Indeed the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to Including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original Naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using
