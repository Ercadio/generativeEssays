From forrest d whitcher Subject SUMMARY responses research on oracle password security My original post was I am building an oracle database to serve as a repository for information which is considered proprietary or As such I want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of the same security checking techniques we use on our nix Specifically I would like to use Crack or something like it to check the encrypted data for easily guessed The use of 'Crack' would depend on oracle using the unix password encryption scheme does anyone know if this is the case or what method is used Any other methods for security checking audit in the oracle environment would be much This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations comments are email My thanks to the people who responded both on usenet and from Oracle The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or OPS passwords to control access opinion on OPS included suggestions to use and not use I was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS accounts presume that the client host provides user Os server OPS users are only as secure as the least secure machine on the Hence you should probably not define any OPS accounts on systems with PC's or limit access of OPS accounts to data with no security Unix oracle servers provide for disabling OPS access over the network orasrv option while relying on host security for local Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented sic audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES Oracle states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext This is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is The concern here is that if users choose easily guessed If a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system s he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users As security risks go the above scenario is pretty low Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files s he can access to the data in If a cracker could break the passwords however s he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid At present Oracle like Unix provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not As with all computer security the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc and the Crack manual both available from ftp archive servers and UNIX R System Security Curry David Addison Welsey Forrest Whitcher Boston Scientific Watertown MA
