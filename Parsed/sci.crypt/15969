from derek atkins subject re clipper and conference calls in article steven bellovin writes in article <>, (wm. michael feeley) writes: > just curious, how would the clipper chip system handle > conference calls? it's not clipper, it's any encryption system. i've seen a number of designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge. depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
key, it can be done. for example, i was using "vat", which is an
internet audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
session. (unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
have the cpu for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site) so, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge. but if
you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation.... -derek -- derek atkins, mit '93, electrical engineering and computer science secretary, mit student information processing board (sipb) mit media laboratory, speech research group pp-asel n1nwh
