From Steven Bellovin Subject Re Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip In article A , James R Ebright writes Now why is that I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack But we will never know And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they couldn't compromise Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising probably with brute force keysearch engines of the complexity of Skipjack Look at the specs Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging away in their crypto busters Maybe even tens of thousands Complexity Not much more than a How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade I think PGP should have bit IDEA keys Thousands Tens of thousands Do some arithmetic, please Skipjack has possible keys Let's assume a brute force engine like that hypothesized for DES microsecond per trial, million chips That's trials per second, or about , years for trials Well, maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build a machine with million chips Sure only years for each solution IDEA uses bit keys Shall I bother doing the calculations for you Hint multiply years by And you can't do IDEA at that speed key setup takes much too long I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just yet DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid 's technology Modern chips can do a lot more NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA I doubt it for the former I have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a strong cryptosystem But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search
