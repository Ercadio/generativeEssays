From Graham Toal Subject Re Let's build software cryptophones for over the internet In article regq INN Hal Finney writes I tried this code yesterday On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over seconds to compress seconds' worth of speech This means that it needs to be optimized by over a factor of before it will be usable in even a half duplex mode Ouch Thanks for trying it I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application It produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads We want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end PC's without DSP cards My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting point Yes I'm not sure if my xposting to comp speech made it to here too, but I've found that a low sample rate samples sec at bits per sample plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into K with a simdgen left over This is definitely worth working on, folks And shorten works in well under real time G
