From Graham Toal Subject Re Let's build software cryptophones for over the In article Hal Finney writes I tried this code On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over seconds to compress seconds' worth of This means that it needs to be optimized by over a factor of before it will be usable in even a half duplex Ouch Thanks for trying I question whether CELP is the best approach for this It produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU We want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end PC's without DSP My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting I'm not sure if my xposting to made it to here too but I've found that a low sample rate samples sec at bits per sample plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into with a simdgen left This is definitely worth working on And shorten works in well under real G
