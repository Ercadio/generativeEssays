From Barry Shein Subject Re Clipper considered harmful Restated and amplified If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line there's no The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used just that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped They get the serial number get the keys and they are in No clipper chip to person association is ever Yeah but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested mistakenly and has their life turned upside down because some law enforcement agency does make a chip person association I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records encode the serial number into the UPC scanned at K Mart along with the credit card info At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or whatever to be coming from your telephone number the person likely is in your house plus or minus some shenanigans of But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id recording the conversation then doing a quick cross lookup and your name comes up as owner of that id mistakenly maybe you sold the phone at a garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or They might only know who one side of the conversation is for Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross correlate such databases loses two First law enforcement agencies can of course do Second they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any money for The IRS for example does do this They just don't spend any money on it so it's technically legal I Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like mastercard if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a lot of opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their I know an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me from his screen I could hear him typing to pull up each screen once on the phone during a dispute I had with them to intimidate me actually not much of a dispute I didn't particularly disagree but for some reason this fellow wanted to play tough guy with me I hope he's better Amazing stuff he had at his finger Be Barry Shein Software Tool Die uunet world bzs Purveyors to the Trade Voice Login WRLD
