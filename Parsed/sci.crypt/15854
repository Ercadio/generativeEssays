From James Kliegel Subject Crypto PenPals I I I read the Now having purchased the recommended books and having taken to heart the advice that one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst I would like to correspond with people interested in I am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking I would like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to David Kahn's Of course I would be interested in general discussions and math I hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the men in the suits I've been hearing so much Unfortunately as a product of the American education system I only know Looking forward to any and all James James Kliegel
