from marc horowitz n nzu subject the source of that announcement the message from the nist about the clipper chip comes from the following address (clipper chip announcement) just who is that, i asked myself, or rather, i asked the computer. % telnet csrc.ncsl.nist.gov 25 trying... connected to csrc.ncsl.nist.gov. escape character is '^]'. 220 first.org sendmail 4.1/nist ready at sat, 17 apr 93 20:42:56 edt expn clipper 250-<csspab@mail-gw.ncsl.nist.gov> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250-<> 250 <> quit 221 first.org closing connection connection closed. well, isn't that interesting. dorothy denning, mitch kapor, marc
rotenberg, ron rivest, jim bidzos, and others. the government, rsa,
tis, cpsr, and the eff are all represented. i don't suppose anybody
within any of these organizations would care to comment? or is this
just the white house's idea of a cruel joke on these peoples' inboxes?
