is the National Security Agency NSA The NSA is the official security body of the It was given its charter by President Truman in the late 's and has continued research in cryptology till the The NSA is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the Governments in general have always been prime employers of The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the NSA is Bamford's book BAMFD gives a history of the people and operations of the The following quote from Massey highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed Without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in For only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in There have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research Open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly But can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break Can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code breakers One might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like Stimson's gentlemen' but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific The wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so '' What are the US export regulations In a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption One is the Bureau of Export Administration BXA in the Department of Commerce authorized by the Export Administration Regulations EAR Another is the Office of Defense Trade Controls DTC in the State Department authorized by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ITAR As a rule of thumb BXA which works with COCOM has less stringent requirements but DTC which takes orders from NSA wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to The newsgroup carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like Make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the What is TEMPEST TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer It was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation from a CRT at quite a distance and with little Needless to say encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext is available this What are the Beale Ciphers and are they a hoax Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for The story in a pamphlet by Ward goes Thomas Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in Bedford County Virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the Declaration of Independence DOI as and are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure The Beale Cypher Association Box Beaver Falls PA You can get the ciphers from the FAQL by including the line send index in a message to and following the There are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating The correct version is based on the pamphlet says John King Some believe the story is a Kruh gives a long list of problems with the Gillogly decrypted with the DOI and found some unexpected strings including Hammer president of the Beale Cypher Association agrees that this string couldn't appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation Gwyn expert is unimpressed with this What is the American Cryptogram Association and how do I get in touch The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography with an emphasis on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with pencil and paper or Its organ The Cryptogram'' includes articles and challenge Among the more than cipher types in English and other languages are simple substitution

flooded and other technical newsgroups into a more appropriate What about the Voynich manuscript Nelson Minar says there is a mailing list on the the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing
