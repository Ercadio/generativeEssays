From Hal Finney Subject Re Let's build software cryptophones for over the Graham Toal writes I forwarded an old posting about CELP speech compression I've since been told that the source of this is on in pub I'm not in a position to any Sun tcp ip gurus out there who think they can marry this with netfone by the end of the week I think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running by the end of the Then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream crypto Two weeks at the Damn I wish I had my sparc I'm stuck on a I tried this code On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over seconds to compress seconds' worth of This means that it needs to be optimized by over a factor of before it will be usable in even a half duplex I question whether CELP is the best approach for this It produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU We want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end PC's without DSP My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting Hal Finney
