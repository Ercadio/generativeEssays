From Marc Thibault Subject A Trojan Horse on the Clipper Gentlefolk, It seems to me that the Step of taking a warrant to the telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring don't you love animal metaphors With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip E N F is not syntactically different than N , all they have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of today's target and use the serial number to identify the session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of the conversation Even without the key, this is great for traffic analysis I can think of several ways to learn the right serial number It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to cooperate or risking getting caught in the act with your alligator clips erect This is particularly handy if you have S and S BTW, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial number Cheers, Marc Marc Thibault Automation Architect CIS , R R , Oxford Mills, Ontario, Canada NC FreeNet aa BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK mQBNAiqxYTkAAAECALfeHYp yC s ScFvJSpj eSCAO hihtneFrrn vuEcSavh AAUwpIUGyV N n lFTPnnLc Ms c PJUPYKVI ABRG I hcmMgVGhpYmF bHQg PG hcmNAdGFuZGEuaXNpcy vcmc HLnv END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
