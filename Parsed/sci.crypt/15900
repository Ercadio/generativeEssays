From Bruce Schneier Subject Re Crypto papers on the net In article BB C C John Kelsey writes I've recently been reading a paper of Merkle's publixhed only on the net, I think discussing three potential replacements for DES Was anyting ever done with these Are Khufu, Khafre, and or Snefru still being discussed anywhere I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA FAQ, and I think it may also be in the sci crypt FAQ On a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find papers articles discussions of cryptology I think I've about exhausted the Math Sci library here, which doesn't seem to have anything more recent than about ' Thanks John Kelsey Khufu and Khafre are both patented Biham and Shamir showed that differential cryptanalysis can break round Khafre with a chosen plaintext attack using different encryptions Khafre with rounds can be broken with the same attack using different encryptions There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if someone wants to take the time to look Khufu has key dependent S boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis Source code for this algorithm and Khafre are in the patent Snefru is a public domain one way hash function The version of Snefru that produces a bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force for four passes or less Given that, SHA and MD are much more efficient Oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre, Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox, Bruce
