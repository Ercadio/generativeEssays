From Bruce Schneier Subject Re Crypto papers on the In article C John Kelsey writes I've recently been reading a paper of Merkle's publixhed only on the net I think discussing three potential replacements for Was anyting ever done with these Are Khufu Khafre and or Snefru still being discussed anywhere I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA FAQ and I think it may also be in the On a related topic can anyone point me toward good sites to find papers articles discussions of cryptology I think I've about exhausted the Math Sci library here which doesn't seem to have anything more recent than about ' John Kelsey Khufu and Khafre are both patented Biham and Shamir showed that differential cryptanalysis can break round Khafre with a chosen plaintext attack using different Khafre with rounds can be broken with the same attack using different There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks if someone wants to take the time to Khufu has key dependent S boxes and is immune to differential Source code for this algorithm and Khafre are in the Snefru is a public domain one way hash The version of Snefru that produces a bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force for four passes or Given that SHA and are much more Oh yes anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox Bruce
