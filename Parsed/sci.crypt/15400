From Vesselin Bontchev Subject Re Secret algorithm Re Clipper Chip and crypto key escrow David Sternlight writes Nothing I'm doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon A typical example of seep minded thinking We all know that David Sternlight is a jerk, but I'm afraid that in this case of the population will think like him Realize it guys NSA, Dorothy Denning, and the US government have already won the battle Unless unless you succeed to wake up the people but nah, that's too unlikely The events are happening too fast, cryptography is a too sophisticated issue, and almost nobody cares anyway A few thousand of net readers won't make the difference, if millions are caught asleep Too sad Regards, Vesselin Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg Tel , Fax Fachbereich Informatik AGN PGP public key available on request Vogt Koelln Strasse , rm C e mail D Hamburg , Germany
