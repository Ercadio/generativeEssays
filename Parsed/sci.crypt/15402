From Vesselin Bontchev Subject Re WH proposal from Police point of view David Sternlight writes dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the effects of the Clipper chip on state and local Actually reading between the lines it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one respect since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it Instead of reading between the lines try to think a little OK if that's way too difficult to you here are some Indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie that your mom is telling you on the So guess what they will do Propose that the new technology is removed Or implement some facilitations Of course you won't want to wait until they get the approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation between two child molesters because meanwhile those two child molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child right So there should be some way for them to get access to those keys quickly right Like they could have a copy of the database and worry about a warrant Regards Vesselin Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev Virus Test Center University of Hamburg Fax Fachbereich Informatik AGN PGP public key available on Vogt Koelln Strasse C e mail D Hamburg Germany
