From Perry Metzger Subject CELP vocoders Graham Toal writes I just meant that no secure dedicated crypto device has ever been given Guerrilla underground devices should be well possible with today's high speed modems not that I can think of many modems that are approved either mind you just the overpriced Couriers Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run digital speech down I think it is I've heard it's Lets say bit Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate be usable If not how fancy does the compression need to be It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed with some room to spare they turn bit samples samples sec into However DSP is hairy and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 's with some room to spare but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this Perry Metzger Laissez faire laissez Le monde va de lui
