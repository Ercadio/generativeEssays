From Perry E Metzger Subject CELP vocoders Graham Toal writes Absolutely I just meant that no secure dedicated crypto device has ever been given approval Guerrilla underground devices should be well possible with today's high speed modems not that I can think of many v bis modems that are approved either mind you just the overpriced Couriers Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run digital speech down K I think it is I've heard it's not Lets say bit samples Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate be usable If not, how fancy does the compression need to be It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed s with some room to spare they turn kbit bit samples, k samples sec into baud However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an implementation I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 's with some room to spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time first DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this problem Perry Metzger Laissez faire, laissez passer Le monde va de lui meme
