From Doug Bank Subject Re REVISED TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF CLIPPER CHIP In article writes The chips are programmed by Mykotronx which calls them the MYK The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology They are implemented in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantities of or The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to seems a bit How big is the chip What kind of packages will be used volt or volt technology How much current will it draw I think there are many practical questions that haven't been answered especially since this chip already exists All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF Secure Compartmented Information Facility which is essentially a The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the About chips are programmed during a single The SCIF is located at At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the Agent enters a secret random bit value into the laptop and agent enters a secret random bit value These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial Thus the unit keys are a function of secret random bits where each agent knows only OK I've got a big problem with all of How in the world do you expect to sell these chips for even after all the overhead involved in this programming procedure people a laptop only chips at a time give me a And how long does all of this take Even if it is a minute per chip it will take the greater part of a day to turn out of these How long do you suppose it will take to program those chips mentioned above This is highly impractical To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT T telephone security device as it will be Suppose I call someone and we both have such a After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key K with the device at the other So where can I find info on this AT T device What kind of vocoder does it use Does it require ISDN phone lines If not is it full duplex How does it sound What kind of synchronization scheme is used Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT Ts choices of protocol Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that conform to these specifications Doug Bank Private Systems Division Motorola Communications Sector Schaumburg Illinois
