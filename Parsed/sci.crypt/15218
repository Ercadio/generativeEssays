From Phil Karn Subject Re Re inventing Crypto Policy An EFF Statement In article qna tINNf p rodan UU NET , avg rodan UU NET Vadim Antonov writes I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the people who designed the system Why on the Earth split the bit key in bit parts to keep them in escrow separately having bit and large volumes of data voice links produce it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply could keep bit sequences in N N independent places and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key N sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the actual key XOR ed with the random sequences Without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question But suppose they already are XORing the two bit parts to produce only bits of real key material Maybe they're using the exportable version of RC PHil
