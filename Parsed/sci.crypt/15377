From Danny O'Bedlam Subject Re Why the clipper algorithm is secret In John Levine writes quoting someone else here The cryptographic protocol though is another I see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as I hope I've shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren't quite as It just occurred to me why the algorithm is If it were published one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper But the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow Yeah The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary design that the Feds say that NSA Is there a patent Is that patent publicly available My betting is that that too is If the algorithm were made public or reverse engineered it would compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip users cypto data but would reduce profits for the selected chip Wouldn't that just be too bad Danny O'Bedlam panix dfl Danny Lieberman PO Box Church St Station New Yawk New Yawk usa
