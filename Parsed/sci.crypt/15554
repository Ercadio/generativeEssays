From pat Pat Myrto Subject Re text of White House announcement and Q As on clipper chip encryption In article fbihh writes Robert Ward writes and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms why is not every American entitled as a matter of Have you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN CONTEXT BTW the appropriate Amendments were posted here some time If not please do so before posting this misinterpretation It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individual to carry handguns grenades and assault It's OK it's Just a month ago I expressed my belief that the right to have a means to shoot your neighbor is not that much necessary to ensure a people's right to be free and got flamed by lots of American gun So I thought Never The new Cripple Chip is a purely American problem so deal with the mess I just wanted to share with you a bit of my experience of living years under a totalitarian regime I'm Bulgarian because I thought that it might be useful to Oh I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action' It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools' and be some serious Fedaral Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so common computer programs even computers themselves are now 'hackers tools' and will become 'terrorist tools' BET ON The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights privacy and overall freedom are concerned the rest of the world remember 'New World Order' will not be far behind only a few Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this For example a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means' The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card an 'Internal passport' with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing Isn't that nice While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys the owner knows his safe has been broken When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations or other stored transmitted data in the near future you have no way of knowing so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the Just like a safe if they have a legal cause they can get the keys from the suspect just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the Same with encryption Record everything get the warrants THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the This Clinton Cripple along with its natural extensions will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer and any meaningful political dissent virtually Which is the general Any propeganda about its being secure and the safeguards and all of that are just that propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this DON'T BE BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING Regards Vesselin Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev Virus Test Center University of Hamburg Fax Fachbereich Informatik AGN PGP public key available on Vogt Koelln Strasse C e mail D Hamburg Germany Without prejudice UCC Pat Myrto Seattle WA If all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat WISDOM Only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about the Albert Einstien
