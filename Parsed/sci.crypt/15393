From david lewis Subject Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip In article BB C C John Kelsey writes David Sternlight writes stuff deleted existence of the key registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build say a DES keysearch machine As originally described, it sounded like any police court combination could acquire the key for a given chip I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole How much does it cost to find one crooked jodge and one crooked cop Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak nesses They may be very expensive, and very difficult But who would trust his her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for say , could by cracked one time in a hundred DES, for all the complaints about a bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx K, but it is not sold by that name Go buy a circuit emulation machine eg Quickturn containing a bunch of FPGAs, say to 's , and program each to be a DES search engine Lets say chips, running at Mhz G tests sec Time is e sec max weeks, weeks average Can't wait that long Buy a bigger machine David Lewis
