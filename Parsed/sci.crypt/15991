From Matthew Subject Implementing a Diffie Hellman key I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper level routines into a single data The upper levels won't know about this and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once at the initial link establishment I figure that I can do this with DES and a Diffie Hellman key Is using a Diffie Hellman exchange to establish a bit DES key acceptable in other words what are the pro's and con's of such a setup Are there any important issues to watch out for aside from filtering out unacceptable keys And in order to achieve this I guess I will need to use math routines for probable prime number calculation exponentiation etc so could someone point me towards a good package this is strictly non commercial matt consent 'The power of one man seems like a small squirt ' tDHoH
