From Steve Brinich Subject S , S Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG This turns those S ,S in a kind of bottleneck for system security The only theory that makes any sense is that S and S are either the same for all chips, or vary among very few possibilities, so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers , about one billion , multiplied by the number of different S , S combinations
