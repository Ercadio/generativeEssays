From Brad Templeton Subject Once tapped your code is no good any It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer It's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid In many ways it would be a positive step if they had Judges set time limits on warrants I At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your That's if we go with this scheme which I am not sure I agree Brad Templeton ClariNet Communications Sunnyvale CA
