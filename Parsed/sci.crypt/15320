From warlord MIT EDU Derek Atkins Subject Re The Old Key Registration Idea BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE In article qn ic Peter Wayner writes The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this Criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town Depends Its possible that the phone sends its serial number in the clear at some specified interval So all a listener needs to do is get that SN, and then get the key for it So swapping phones isn't a problem for the gov't, that is They still know that this line belongs to you, so they just watch the line and see the SN, and then they get the key for that SN In either case, I think we need to look at this a bit deeper 'jbl mW wxlD Well, I think this is understood The major problem is that a lot of people just don't trust this key escrow stuff, and the fact that the algorithms are classified So, yes, a lot of this needs to be looked at closer derek PGP key available upon request on the key server BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE Version iQBuAgUBK EbXDh K zBsGrxAQHzcALCAlvWtnvi aySWf id MN nsybTwQI jQLgPKX tx qjGC BUQRZAtMQutkoVnvx MqT EZFM uundRWD cOwbb CC Gy gT JtLRqU aF VSf SGNQqg fGRj END PGP SIGNATURE Derek Atkins, MIT ' , Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Secretary, MIT Student Information Processing Board SIPB MIT Media Laboratory, Speech Research Group warlord MIT EDU PP ASEL N NWH
