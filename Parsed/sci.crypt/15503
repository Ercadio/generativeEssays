From Amanda Walker Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security Perry Metzger writes If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back I So why is Cylink the only and expensive game in town Note I think Cylink is great and if my boss would double my salary I'd buy a bunch of their stuff One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non proprietary voice encryption This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme and easier to This is of course either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it Indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good system right A standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a DES chip a integrated modem module and a small processor to do glue work are all you need to have a secure Great Where can I buy it Another note If Clipper increases the incentive to bring stronger encryption to the mass market all the It's far overpriced at the Yes cheap crypto is good but we don't need it from the I don't care where we need to get it from I care where we can get it from and whether it will interoperate with everyone Indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are Were it not for the NSA and company cheap encryption systems would be As it is they try every trick in the book to stop Had it not been for them I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export a restriction I firmly oppose The only thing stopping people from making cheap encryption is greed they want a lock on the They aren't the ones making cheap crypto They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's When they hand you a clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage your prize for having traded in your Oh come Only if you trust it farther than it A Clipper phone IS NOT a substitute for a Cylink phone or a STU It's a substitute for the voice scramblers advertised in the back of Radio Are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves No because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged I Modulo ITAR it's not the government that has sabotaged the Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right Amanda Walker InterCon Systems Corporation
