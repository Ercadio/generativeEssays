From Steven Bellovin Subject Clipper some new thoughts I'd desparately prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last That's especially true for For that matter I've created since the traffic is appearing in many different groups right I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my followup to Frankly if you're not an absolutist your feelings may turn on some of these For example with an bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one repository is shall we say overly pliable a would be eavesdropper would need to recover just more bits of I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive A slightly more complex scheme XOR ing the key with a random number and then with its complement would produce two bit subkeys neither of which is useful That variant is much more resistant to Clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even Other Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key double encrypted with the escrow repositories' public For that matter they could do that only with session keys and have no back door at In that case the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be This would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you make sure they stop'' We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally signed record of the time phone number etc of the That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the I can suggest other variations Suppose each Clipper chip had public key Each would be used times after which you'd need more keying Not a bad idea in any This could be used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is Apart from the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it I've heard rumors over the years that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too Not that they couldn't crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back The cryptographic protocol though is another I see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as I hope I've shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren't quite as
