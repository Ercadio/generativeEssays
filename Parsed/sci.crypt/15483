From Perry Metzger Subject Facinating facts bit serial number possibly fixed and Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Quisling writes Each chip includes the following components the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an bit family key that is common to all chips N a bit serial number U an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip A thirty bit serial And we are told the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial That means that there are only one billion possible unit To generate the unit key for a serial number N the bit value N is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block and are then used as keys to triple encrypt producing a bit block E D E Similarly N is padded with two other bit blocks to produce and and two additional bit blocks and are computed E D E E D E and are then concatenated together giving The first bits are assigned to and the second bits to The rest are The unit key U is the XOR of and and are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected and is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government U is completedly determined given and If and do not change they constitute effective master keys along with F the theft of which or the possession of which by various authorities completely obviates the security of the However more interestingly we know for a fact that if and are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than Why not pick and at random Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a Even if and change periodically the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of If and do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back derived given enough unit key serial number We are assured that this cannot happen but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and soon foreign intelligence services that gain the information via Presumably we will eventually have the information as well reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year but by the time we know it may be too As a sequence of values for and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part The second disk is similar but contains the The third disk contains the unit keys Agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second The third disk is used to program the After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left None of this makes me feel the least bit The silly notion of destroying the laptop appears to be yet another bizarre We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few On the other hand what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from and in the first place other than to weaken the We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information its probably worth hundreds of million so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to And to tell you the truth doing this in a vault rather than in Joe Random Tempest shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high school dropouts from Peoria impressed but it does very little for most of the rest of The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of The first two would provide the seeds and and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow What would this provide Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always Who cares The NSA must be laughing out loud because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have Perry Metzger Laissez faire laissez Le monde va de lui
