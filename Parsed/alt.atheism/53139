from geoff arnold sun bos r h coast near the top subject re where are they now your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable
posts. the first i captured was by ken arromdee on 19 feb 1990, on the
subject "re: atheist too?". that was article #473 here; your question
was article #53766, which is an average of about 48 articles a day for
the last three years. as others have noted, the current posting rate is
such that my kill file is depressing large...... among the posting i
saved in the early days were articles from the following notables: >from: (loren petrich)
>from: (jesus christ of nazareth)
>from: mrc@tomobiki-cho.cac.washington.edu (mark crispin)
>from: (jim perry)
>from: (james j. lippard)
>from: (marvin minsky) an interesting bunch.... i wonder where #2 is?
