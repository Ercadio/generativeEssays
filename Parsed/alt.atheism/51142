From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re Political Atheists Jon Livesey writes Much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for The only relevance here is that you don't seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is That is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet Well I've said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a However who is at blame is another It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to There is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital So when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of And driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by They are risks that we take upon ourselves And I argue that our law system is a similar Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent In fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of If our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the Again the blame is on No I'm This is what you You were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual No I just commented that the state does the It does not depend on there being false How could it The state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes Yes but the state is not at fault in such a The state can only do so much to prevent false It is So what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system I'm saying capital punishment is murder Not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human That's my definition of I make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective Okay so this is what you call But the question is whether or not all such murders are Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances If we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral We should not play word games and pretend that murder isn't And that's my opinion about how society ought to be But this is basically how it Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by And every member of society shares this And most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it But we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its What ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one No we were not discussing an objective moral I was showing you that you didn't have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder Murder violates the golden Executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim We're not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the Yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable Sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself Here is what you said And since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or If the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be What you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite The jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or But in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a That is twelve members must be convinced of a Moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and I would laugh But then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was But would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds If we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth It's not a question of Your claim which I have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from Yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can't always determine the difference in our flawed I think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn't objectively You see it doesn't matter if we know it is fair or Objectively it is either fair or it is Now there's a huge If we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know The difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can But what we know has no effect on an objective I think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to I'm not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that I am pretty sure does not Why are you so sure I simply want people to confront My reality Why is your reality important In this case the reality is that ideal theories' apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice For every innocent person released from Death Row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at We simply don't But we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most And you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective Now what are we going to do On the one hand we can pretend that we have an 'ideal' theory and that we can know things we can never know and the Justie System is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our Well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as On the other hand we can recognize that all Justice has a small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say Well here we go murdering Maybe some of us will even say Gee I wonder if all this is strictly necessary Yes we all bear the Most people seem willing to do I think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word We must realize the consequences of all our Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack And lest I forget I also don't think we have an objective moral system and I believe I only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of I don't think our country has an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in Without omniscience an objective system is not possible in keith
