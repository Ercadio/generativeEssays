From Chris Blask Subject Re A silly question on x tianity Andrew Tong writes Mark McCullough writes Question This attitude god character seems awfully egotistical and But Christianity tells people to be What's the deal Well God pretty much has a right to be egotistical and I mean he created you doesn't he have the right to be proud of such a job Of course people don't have much of a right to be What have they accomplished that can match God's accomplishments anyways How do their abilities compare with those of God' We're an imbecile worm of the earth to quote If you were God and you created a universe wouldn't you be just a little irked if some self organizing cell globules on a tiny planet started thinking they were as great and awesome as you unfortunately the logic falls apart quick all perfect insulted or threatened by the actions of a lesser creature actually by offspring How why shuold any all powerful all perfect feel either proud or offended Anything capable of being aware of the relationship of every aspect of every particle in the universe during every moment of time simultaneously should be able to understand the cause of every action of every 'cell globule' on each tniy Well actually now that I think of it it seems kinda odd that God would care at all about the OK so it was a bad But the amazing fact is that He does care apparently and that he was willing to make some grand sacrifices to ensure our All powerful Owner Of Everything in the Universe Makes Great Sacrifices makes a great headline but it doesn't make any What did he sacrifice Where did it go that he couldn't get it back If he gave something up who'd he give it up to chris you guys have fun I'm agoin' to Key West
