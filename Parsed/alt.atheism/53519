From bobbe Robert Beauchaine Subject Nostalgia The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of The Best of for your reading I'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving I think the following comes from John Johnson but someone correct me if I'm This is probably the longest of my entire So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled In considering the Christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of As you will see Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the New We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the Since the gospels were written at least years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as But for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face Immanuel We begin of course at the Mt Mary will bear a son and you Joseph will name him 'Jesus' which means G'd is salvation for he will save his people from their All this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet Isaiah In the days of Ahaz BCE king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not quite conquer When the house of David Ahaz and his court in Judah were told of this heart and the heart of its people And the lord G'd said to Isaiah go to meet with the lord spoke to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah naturally saying Ask a sign of G'd your It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as But Ahaz said I won't ask I will not put the lord to a Then Isaiah said Hear then O house of Is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too Therefore the lord himself will give you a sign Behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him Immanuel which means G'd is with He will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose For before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings you dread will have been Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in Further he the Hebrew word almah young woman as specifically But this is not a prophecy about the It is not a prophecy about an event to happen years It is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah In short it not about Matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit Mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with Of course the fit is shady and has Jesus while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men was never called by the name If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus it becomes at best a cut and paste a second class Not too Egypt After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem Matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to Egypt as if he wishes to liken Jesus to This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king Mt remained there until the death of This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken Out of Egypt I have cal led my What the lord really said was Hosea When Israel was a child I loved And out of Egypt I called my The more I called them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the Ba'als and kept burning incense to Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's But it was indeed Israel that once called out of Egypt wanted to This is Jesus is certainly not being spoken of And if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G' Again this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had Rachel Weeps While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male Matthew then writes Mt By this that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled A voice was heard in Ramah wailing and loud lamentation Rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they were no The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon of Assyria in Rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel Ephraim and Manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no It is metaphorical of course since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian It is interesting to note that it was Leah not Rachel who was the ancestor of the Judeans the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were If anyone should do weeping for her children it is The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to Ephrath Bethlehem As for Herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually One never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the Herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah The children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the Assyrian G'd comforts the weeping Rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back Of course this would not suit Matthew's purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for Again the prophecy Matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too The Nazarene We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean After leaving Egypt Joseph wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth Mt what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled He shall be called a First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet s this Second we have to ask who He There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a Still worse there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at In the book of Judges an angel tells Samson's mother that she will Judges and bear a No razor shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his He will deliver Israel from the hands of the This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of G' But it is the best that can be Obviously Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies in that he is simple making them up Bearing our Diseases Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and Mt This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah He took our infirmities and bore our As expected the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian We have Is Surely he the suffering servant has borne our sickness and carried our From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel Jehovah's chosen servant and He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G' The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and They do not speak of a servant going around and healing Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual Jews Jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he So while someone might want to say that figuratively Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its Silent Messiah Upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local Mt This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is I will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the He will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his The Isaiah passage quoted reads Is Behold my servant whom I uphold my chosen in whom my soul I have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the We will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering He will faithfully bring forth He will not fail burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has established justice in the And the coastlands await his You see Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of Christians could never think of Jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn But the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of G' Also the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic coastlands await his to the Christologic the Gentiles will hope in his While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus one has only to read the whole chapter Isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and So we see that when Matthew's attempt at prophecy is examined it Three Days and Three Nights Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus He speaks of his crucifixion and Mt For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three Before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the Jews understood As far as day names went each was hours long lasting from sunset to the following sunset What was referred to as a day was the period of light from to the ending sunset at Thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at Friday evening and lasted until saturday This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week Thus when days and nights are referred to together hour daylight portions and hour night periods are being spoken Thus Jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three As the good book tells us Jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is Friday He then was put into the grave sometime after Then Jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call Sunday The dawn after the sabbath was over What this means is that Jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from Friday night to some time before Sunday We could also add a little time before Friday since the bible is not specific What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one Certainly this is a problem for Jesus There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's And no matter who made the prediction it is more than it is counter Hearing Understanding Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he If the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any Matthew says Mt With them the audience indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says You will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never Because this people's heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them her with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the This is in BCE when Israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of Isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from G'd calling him to bring reform to Israel and Is And G'd said Go and say to this people Hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not ' Make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy and shut their eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be Then Isaiah said How long lord And he said Until the cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without men and the land is utterly desolate and the G'ds take men far away and forsaken places are many in the And though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is The holy seed is its Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's and David's seed If you read the rest of Isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant a light to the Look at Isaiah We see that Matthew has cut and pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse to suit his own gospel More than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's And as we see Isaiah's verses are not prophecies but rather commands from G'd to him in the Once again Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic Mt said nothing to them without a This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet I will open my mouth to them in I will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the Matthew really botches up He attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the Ps I will open my mouth in I will utter dark sayings of old things that we all have heard and known things that our fathers have told We will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the As was pointed out the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this Apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it Perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again Matthew has altered the Old Testament As Jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand The parables in the Psalms are not to be Further they speak of things known that our fathers have told Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and This is in direct opposition to the parables in the No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them And still once again Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their But Christians rarely look at Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look Excuses of Little Faith In we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one Not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the But Jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didn't have enough This seems Why was this demon special It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does Apparently enough faith will allow someone to move Of course you will find no one these days that can move real No one parts The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning And the gods including Jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred They are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long Yet life goes Tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days Jehovah But now they are All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God We're too lazy we're not zealous enough we're sinful it's just his plan we put too many of our own demands on G'd's appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet G'd on his Yet even the most pious of men have not seen G' You dear reader have not seen G' Not literally you know that to be I know that's presumptuous and But searching your heart you know what I All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G' They say our little faith does not merit us to see G' Sometimes they say See the love in these people you worship see the lives of people that is seeing G' Thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday But that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking it is not seeing G'd the way people used to What we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by Christian Atheist alike beauty created by the mind of These are the things that are done these are what we But it is said this is so only because everybody has little Jesus Rides on an Ass Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Mt This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet saying Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a ass Of course the passage quoted from Zechariah reads a little Lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass he will command peace to the There isn't all that much difference here except that Zechariah only involves one animal an ass colt while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly Thus he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult From Matthew's version we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two This could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma We find that in the account written earlier by Mark only the colt was called for and brought to This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has Now excluding many respectable Christians I have met I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed Then entering the Jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the But Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done Mt Haven't you read Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect ' It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things AND since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite We might ask Jesus or Matthew Haven't you read for the source reads Psalms O YaHWeH our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world You whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the The passages hardly need There is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to G'd not his messiah king and not As mentioned it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic YHVH said to my Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah king is to be The Jews agree it is king But then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms The LORD said to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your Taken at face value Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic One assumes he is in opposition to their Of course the Christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah It's tempting to believe this if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of But there are In Jesus's time the psalm was thought to be about the And it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's Of course the Jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the Christians The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiah Jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiah's advent was imminent and who interpreted Psalms among others as being What is the problem then Psalm literally reads YHVH's utterance to my lord Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Rule in the midst of your foes Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this But in the Hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation Adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G' It is merely an address of There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah That this is supposed to be written by David is not The title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of David or a psalm about It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about David's covenant and endorsement from G' If the psalm had been written by David it is unlikely that he would be talking about the The idea of a perfect king descended from David was not present in David's We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on The description in the psalm fit David very David was promised by G'd a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the It all We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone Here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather Still this event is common to the other gospels So we let Matthew off a little more easily this It is interesting to note though how Matthew dresses up the The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a Matthew has the Pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity be the target of Jesus's As we might expect Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Such power is the Moses Jesus Had it Together All We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in John's The gospel story of John deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even But for the moment we will just look at one The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G' When constructing the history of Abraham Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish While this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king David the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the But to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly John speaking Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My He say it and was It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything I have tried and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little It is par for the course to see John making up Old Testament backings just like his forerunner Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to The Potter's Field We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers Judas Matthew writes Mt And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple Judas But the chief priests taking the silver said It isn't lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood So bought a potter's field with it to bury strangers Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel and they gave them for the potter's field as the lord directed This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament First Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use they weighed out my wages thirty shekels of Then YHVH said to me Cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which I was paid off by So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of First of all the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of G' The deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one The word treasury had been replaced by the King James Scholars with to the potter precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit But this is a blatant The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context whereas potter's field is totally Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond However given Matthew's track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional Of course Matthew would have ample reason for altering the The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation and if as most Christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to toss However the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high The high priests would not put the money in the The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite Of course to the average Thursday Night Bible student the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face To those Matthew's work is convincing Wine Vinegar Casting Lots Then Jesus is led away to be Mt gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink And when they had crucified him they divided his garments among them by casting lots that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet They parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast First of all the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that Roman soldiers drank We find that right before Jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with Jn said I A bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his When he had received the vinegar he said It is finished But Matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the Ps I looked for pity but there was none and for comforters but I found They gave me poison for food they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to Add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Of course the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of This does indeed seem to be a show of The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military It is not about the messiah or It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the Jesus of the gospels says Lk Jesus said Father forgive them the don't know what they do Further Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into Jesus's drink not his meat as the psalm With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask What of the casting of lots This brings up the Psalm which deserves discussion all by Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those As we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's For a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some The Psalm This psalm is attributed to David as a lament of his condition under the attack of his It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of Taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite We will examine the primary Verse My god my god why have you forsaken me Why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning Oh my god I cry by day but you don't answer and by night but find no Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus rather than king Of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its Indeed Jesus doesn't do much groaning even when on the He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the But I am a worm and no man scorned by All who see me mock at They make faces and wag their heads He committed his cause to So let him deliver for he delights in This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a Many bulls encompass they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring Yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encir cle me they have pierced my hands and I can see all my They divide my garments among them and cast lost for my But you YHVH be not far away my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog Save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull It would seem quite convincing and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so Unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal The words have pierced really do not exist in the The correct Hebrew translation is Yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic The word in the Hebrew text is literally like the lion ka'ari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ka' But to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the Apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so Verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a This naturally fits the psalm's true subject king As a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his But then facts aren't bound by our religious Matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord But the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian It is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the New Testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager But it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic So far this has not said good things for The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's John's gospel recount written about years after the fact tells us at Jesus's execution Jn But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and these things took place that Scripture be The will look on him whom they've Of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with Zc And YHVH will give victory to And on that day I will seek to destroy the nations that come against Jerusalem in Judah And I will pour a spirit of compassion and on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's Matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were Reckoned with Transgressors After his arrest Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship According to one version of the gospel tale Jesus gets executed along with two Mk And with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his And so the scripture was fulfilled which says He was reckoned with the Here Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah about the servant nation of The passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any The servant is thought of as a This also happens to fit the description of Had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with Jesus also reviled This is to be expected from a couple of Of course in his later recount Luke decides to change some Luke tells us Lk And one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed Aren't you the messiah Save yourself and us This certainly fits with Mark's recount which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said Save yourself and that the robbers did the But then Luke goes on But the other criminal rebuked the first saying Don't you fear G'd since you are under the same sentence of condemnation And we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our But this man has done nothing And he said Jesus remember me when you come in your And Jesus answered Verily I say to you today you will be with me in Now this little dialogue seems highly It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his Such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn't seem likely to have been a We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Of course Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark' Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus not It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his In this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have The End of the World Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning The disciples Tell us when will this the temple's
