Subject Re Death Penalty was Re Political Atheists From SSAUYET SCOTT SAUYET writes in responding to Dave First With Official Nickname Fuller The death penalty IS a deterrent The person executed will never commit a crime That means that it is an effective anti recidivism It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from Or commiting treason are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA That is if there were no death penalty would its introduction deter a would be criminal from committing her his crime I doubt This is only the first Even if it were a strong deterrent short of being a complete deterrent I would reject For what about the case of the innocent executed And even if we could eliminate this possibility I would reject the death penalty as This makes me something of a radical on the issue although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to I would if magically placed in charge facilitate state aided suicide for criminals who have life This could be a replacement for capital Those who don't want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this Scott Sauyet
