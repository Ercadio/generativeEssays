From Tammy R Healy Subject Re Free Moral Agency and Kent S In article Kent Sandvik writes From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Free Moral Agency and Kent S Date Thu, Apr GMT In article , TAMMY R HEALY wrote Ezekiel says, Your hart was filled with pride because of all your beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor Therefore I have cast you down the the ground and exposed you helpless before the curious gaze of Kings For those of you who are Bible scholars, you knowthat the st verses refer to the Prince of Tyre This is a prophesy about and addressed to the human prince Verses refer to the King of Tyre, which is a term for Satan Tammy, what's the rationale to connect the prince of Tyre with Satan, could you give us more rational bible cites, thanks I'm afraid that if this is not the case, your thinking model falls apart like a house of cards But let's see Cheers, Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the net At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel Like I said, the Prince of Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre He was a wicked man By calling Satan the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one, although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as being a reference to Satan I haven't read Ezekiel throughly in a long time Tammy
