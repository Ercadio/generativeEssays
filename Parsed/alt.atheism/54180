From Keith Justified And Ancient Cochran Subject We don't need no stinking subjects In article Keith Allan Schneider writes Keith Justified And Ancient Cochran writes Keith Allan Schneider writes Keith Justified And Ancient Cochran writes No if you're going to claim something then it is up to you to prove Think Cold Fusion Well I've provided examples to show that the trend was general and you or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding mating practices I don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural And again the mating practices need to be So what you're saying is that your mind is made up and you'll just explain away any differences at being statistically insignificant Try to find immoral non mating related So you're excluding mating related activities from your natural morality No but mating practices are a special I'll have to think about it some So you'll just explain away any inconsistancies in your theory as being a special case Yes I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the goal of species propogation in But I am not equating the two as you so That is an objective system isn't necessarily the natural Are you or are you not the man who wrote A natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals follow But while the natural system is objective all objective systems are not the natural So the terms can not be The natural system is a subset of the objective You just equated Re read your own Now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have the capacity of being immoral I don't claim that homosexuality is It isn't harmful although it isn't helpful either to the mating process And when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom don't you mean bisexuality A study release in found that of female seagulls are Well I'm saying that these goals are not That is why they must be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural goal but they are somewhat removed Postulate To assume That's The goals themselves aren't I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the Earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are the portions of Angels that intrudes into three dimensional You could but such would contradict Now apply this last sentence of your to YOUR Notice how your are contridicting observations I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connecting them I can determine the length of the third But a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be I don't think your postulate would be You don't know much math do you The ability to use SAS to determine the length of the third side of the triangle is fundemental to Guess which one people are going to be more receptive In order to assume something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates Yes and I think the goals of survival and happiness do You think they don't Or are they not good goals Goals Again if one of the goals of this objective natural morality system you are proposing is survival of the species then homosexuality is B c d e f g k m r s t TSAKC My thoughts my posts my ideas my responsibility my beer my OK
