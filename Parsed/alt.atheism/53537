From Turin Turambar, ME Department of Utter Misery Subject Re Christian Morality is In article A , Kevin Anthoney writes In article eastman UUCP writes The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to But think about it for a minute Would you rather have someone love you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to love you There's a difference between believing in the existence of an entity, and loving that entity God could show me directly that he exists, and I'd still have a free choice about whether to love him or not So why doesn't he Kevin Anthoney Don't believe anything you read in sig files Kevin makes a good point here, and when that theists miss all too often That is, the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreement love of that diety, so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond belief I guess the standard argumet goes something like well, once you believe in God, you know God is love, and you will choose to love him if it wasnt so widely accepted and asserted it'd be laughable best regards, Adam Adam John Cooper Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no claws Understand one another I fear I am beyond your comprehension Gandalf
