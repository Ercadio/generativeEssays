From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re Political Atheists Keith Justified And Ancient Cochran writes How many contridictions do you want to see Good If I claim something is a general trend then to disprove this I guess you'd have to show that it was not a general No if you're going to claim something then it is up to you to prove Think Cold Fusion Well I've provided examples to show that the trend was general and you or others have provided some counterexamples mostly ones surrounding mating practices I don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural And again the mating practices need to be Try to find immoral non mating related So you're excluding mating related activities from your natural morality No but mating practices are a special I'll have to think about it some Yes I think that the natural system can be objectively deduced with the goal of species propogation in But I am not equating the two as you so That is an objective system isn't necessarily the natural Are you or are you not the man who wrote A natural moral system is the objective moral system that most animals follow But while the natural system is objective all objective systems are not the natural So the terms can not be The natural system is a subset of the objective Now since homosexuality has been observed in most animals including birds and dolphins are you going to claim that most animals have the capacity of being immoral I don't claim that homosexuality is It isn't harmful although it isn't helpful either to the mating process And when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom don't you mean bisexuality Because we can't determine to what end we should be Are you claiming to be a group We usually implies more than one This is standard Read any The we forms are used Well I'm saying that these goals are not That is why they must be postulates because there is not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argued that they arise from the natural goal but they are somewhat removed Postulate To assume That's The goals themselves aren't I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the Earth that the moon is actually made of green cheese and the stars are the portions of Angels that intrudes into three dimensional You could but such would contradict I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that given the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connecting them I can determine the length of the third But a postulate is something that is generally or always found to be I don't think your postulate would be Guess which one people are going to be more receptive In order to assume something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulates Yes and I think the goals of survival and happiness do You think they don't Or are they not good goals keith
