From Fred Rice Subject Re Ancient islamic rituals In Chris Faehl writes In article Fred Rice writes deleted to get to the point Therefore in a nutshell my opinion is that pre marital sex makes the likelihood of extra marital sex more Furthermore in my opinion extra marital sex helps break down partnerships and leads to greater divorce This in turn in my opinion creates trauma and a less stable environment for children who are then in my opinion more likely to grow up with psychological problems such as depression And thus sex outside of marriage is in the long run harmful to I think that you are drawing links where there are none having sex before marriage has nothing to do with adultery once committed into The issue as I see it is more of how committed you are to not foisting pain on your spouse and how confident you are about In addition what someone does within their marriage is their own business not mine and not I have witnessed strong relationships that incorporate extra marital I would agree with your assertion about children children should not be witness to such confusing relationships if adultery is stressful to adults which I assume it in general is how can we expect children to understand it Where is the evidence for my opinions At the moment there are just generalities I can For example I read that in the century the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies probably what I was reading referred particularly to the USA Similarly one can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage in this century in Western societies particularly with the sexual revolution of the 's but even before that I think otherwise the sexual revolution of the 's would not have been possible particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently Christian moral teachings against sex outside of I propose that these two trends greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity are linked with the latter being a prime cause of the I cannot provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon Why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression You can't just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation in them and make a sweeping statement of I mean you CAN and people HAVE but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable At best it's a gross oversimplification of the push pull factors people My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra marital sex one which I personally believe has some My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a plausible argument can be made against extra marital At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that just that it is To try to convince you all of this particular point of view I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field in order to gather further evidence which I simply do not have time to do Also note that I said that I think extra marital sex is a prime cause in my opinion of the generally greater levels of psychological problems especially depression in Western I am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause one of the significant contributions to this I think when you say you think my view is simplistic you have forgotten this I admit that there are probably other factors but I do think that extra marital sex and IMO subsequent destabilization of the family is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this Fred Rice
