From Jon Livesey Subject Re Yet more Rushdie Re ISLAMIC LAW In article Gregg Jaeger writes In article Jon Livesey writes I hope an Islamic Bank is something other than BCCI which ripped off so many small depositors among the Muslim community in the Uk and Grow up childish Gregg I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim them to be upsets you but exactly who is being childish here is open to BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank what will someone bet me they weren't real Islamic owners and operators and yet it actually turned out to be a long running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather than the nasty interest motivated western bank down the street Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all work out right next
