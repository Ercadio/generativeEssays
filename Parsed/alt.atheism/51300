From I Benedikt Rosenau Subject Re Yeah Right In article Charley Wingate writes And what about that revelation thing Charley If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well it's obviously a risk one I see it is not rational but it is Does madness qualify as intellectual engagement too Many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge is I'm not an objectivist so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary One can get some rough understanding but the language is from the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the perspective of what's being described rather inexact to be charitable Exactly why science uses QM representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical Nor is it supposed to be the truth as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary Admittedly not every religion says so but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being Show me something similar in An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is that the better descriptive language is not With the effect that the models presented are And one can argue that the other way around namely that the only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified showing that it is And in case it holds reliable information can you show how you establish that This word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you can show how reliability can be Haven't you read the many posts about what reliability is and how it can be acheived respectively determined Benedikt
