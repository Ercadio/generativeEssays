Subject Periodic Post of Charley Challenges with additions From David Wood New in this version challenge plus an addendum summarizing Charley's responses to This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently specious I'll continue to re post periodically until he answers them publicly indicates that he won't answer them stops posting to the community tells me to stop or I get totally I apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but I'm at a loss to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual This is re post Charley I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and I once again challenge you to prove me To make the task as easy for you as possible I'll present concise re statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period I will re post this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that I notice a post by you on another I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my If you can be kind enough to re post or e mail such articles I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this Now to the After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to all atheists I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware You failed to do Please do so Question Can you name any posters who do not fit into your stereotype Here is the context for the question This is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line in assuming that it YOU however deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean to imply that everybody's experience was along the same Whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you've come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and You failed to do Please do so Question Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning Here is the context for the question Revelation is not reason and if we DO have revelation then reasoning is NOT all we First show me that revelation Second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived According to my Webster's revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine Now tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses Tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are When I say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple If you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with then You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason Again this is No it is simple I challenge you to show me then Few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than I allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for Now show me that mystical experiences Remember you aren't allowed to go by testimony of others mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable you know tainted by my own Further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person's reasoning I challenge you to show me these If you cannot do so you might as well give up the then Let me reiterate you have NOT explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked In point of fact I specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and I note for the record that you appear to have declined my What is it How is it sensed How is it interpreted And how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities You have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your If you can't answer them your claims are entirely You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by posters are unverifiable and I asked you to identify one such claim that I have You have failed to do Please do so Question Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical If so please repeat Here is the context for the question I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong then Likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this Give me your address and I'll be pleased to send you a Failing that can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical I demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up If you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn't help but become I asked you to explain the Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that I have asked be they atheist or You have failed to answer the Please do so Question Do you retract your claim that posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect If you don't retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism Here is the context for the question First quote have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on it is up to atheists to prove it to then Second quote I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of First you claimed that you would probably not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous Later you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your Please clarify this seeming Question Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text Here is the context for the question First you said My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first THese are not rules of morality but then If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position then they cannot be argued As usual your responses are awaited with Dave Wood For the record below is a compilation of Charley's responses to these challenges to This makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of Wood's Wood I do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response At some point I might read and respond to your article and then again I might My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first THese are not rules of morality but I left out something else I don't respond Utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments meta arguments as some call them When I have to start saying that's not what I said and the response is did so there's no reason to If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position then they cannot be argued
