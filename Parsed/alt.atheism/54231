From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re Cruel Keith Ryan writes I don't think Although some forms of execution are painful the electric chair looks particularly so I think the pain is relatively short Drawing and quartering on the other hand looks very painful and the victim wouldn't die right away he'd bleed to death I'd imagine Ah so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful as you origionally It is about long term pain eg non short Why this sudden chance in your stance I don't think I've changed my stance at My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel I didn't say what would be considered cruel only that a painless death wasn' Now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering I I don't think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it's over so Hmmmmm Pardon Could it be that a counter example has been made which renders your previous stance null and void Why don't you admit that your previous stance is incorrect Or if you somehow managed to slip up and misstated your origional stance why not admit it Well again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel but I don't think I stated that all painful executions are I think that some are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the By the way how long is too long Anything more than an instant I Any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this includes the gas chamber and drawing and quartering I'd say that any pain that lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose keith
