From Bake Timmons Subject Re Amusing atheists and anarchists writes My turn I went back and reread your All you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasn't as funny as Nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak As most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable Sorry you're I did not clearly state Rule Condescending to the population at large theists will not win many people to your faith anytime It only ruins your How am I being condescending to the population at large I am stating something that happened to be true for a long time I couldn't believe that people actually believed in this god It was an alien concept to I am not trying to win people to my faith as you put I have no Religion was a non issue when I had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to Atheist by default I guess you could The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational Once one has accepted the assumption that there is no god s and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict your assumption then I would say there's a lack of consistency Now I know you'll get on me about If the positive belief that God does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic But you probably like me seem to be a soft Sorry for the The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply Sorry been reading too much on the CLIPPER project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in What is the CLIPPER project BTW Rule Don't mix apples with How can you say that the extermination by the Mongols was worse than Stalin Khan conquered people unsympathetic to his That was But Stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state How can anyone be worse than that Many rulers have done similar things in the past only Stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on The evidence is that some of the early European rulers ruled with an iron fist much like Stalin' You threw in numbers and I am sick of hearing about Stalin as an example because the example doesn't You managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of It might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer The Stalin example is important not only because it's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had The evidence I am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative Say I claim there are no pink I have never seen a pink crow but that doesn't mean it couldn't But this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasn't been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me In a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink That is what I am saying when I look at the I look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesn't show what theists want it to show and go First all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the Why One of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this You can pretend that they don't want this but I for one can accept it and even want it myself And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a Can love as a truth be proven logically themselves namely a god or So in principle it's hard to see how theists are necessarily Makes no sense to They seem arrogant to make such a claim to But my previous refutation still stands and I believe there may be another one on the John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at Many Christians I know also boast in this way but I still do not necessarily see it as Of course I do know arrogant Christians doctors and teachers as Technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant Jesus for Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism If you are talking about weak atheism which I believe in then I refuse such a Atheism is a lack of I used good ol' Occam's Razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that as I see things even if I present the hypothesises in an equal fasion I find the theist argument not I speak against strong I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is I believe I answered I apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but I saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie Christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots No apology
