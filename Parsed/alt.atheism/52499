USA is not a Christian nation Subject What is the purpose of this newsgroup Typical posting Why have a newsgroup about atheism Why do atheists organize in groups What is there to discuss Response Many things are discussed here including Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's family Prayer in schools Discrimination against atheists Sunday trading laws The Satanic Child Abuse myth Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' How religious societies prey sic on new college students How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers Whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual Why people become atheists Of course inevitably tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed Subject Hitler was an atheist Typical posting Hitler was an atheist and look at what he did Response Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an As he said himself The folkish minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will and actually fulfill God's will and not let God's word be For God's will gave men their form their essence and their Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation the divine Therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator by defending myself against the Jew I am fighting for the work of the Adolf Hitler from Mein Kampf Ralph Of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist Subject The Bible proves it Typical posting In the Bible it says Response Most of the readers of feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years Thus any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not Note that this feeling tends to extend to other It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own Subject Pascal's Wager Typical posting If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you will go to Therefore it is foolish to be an Response This argument is known as Pascal's It has several Firstly it does not indicate which religion to Indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out This is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell If a person is a follower of religion X he may end up in religion Y's version of Secondly the statement that If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not Suppose you're believing in the wrong God the true God might punish you for your Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable If in fact the possibility of there being a God is close to zero the argument becomes much less So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe Also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of It is not a matter of will or cost benefit Formally speaking the argument consists of four statements One does not know whether God Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in There are two approaches to the The first is to view as an assumption and as a consequence of One problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no This is considered invalid in information Statement indicates one has no information about God but statement indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about This violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information at no cost The alternative approach is to claim that and are both The problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that The argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests to believe in God a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a He will spurn the assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in Subject What is Occam's Razor Typical posting People keep talking about Occam's What is it Response William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's In its original form it said Do not multiply entities That is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor they generally express it more generally for example as Take the simplest solution The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a God who created the Clearly this God must be of non zero Given that both explanations fit the facts Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out We just imagine that there This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find Subject Why it's good to believe in Jesus Typical posting I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my Response Preaching is not Feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion Such postings do not belong on and will be rejected from try the newsgroup You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told Subject Why I know that God exists Typical posting I know from personal experience and prayer that God Response Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not That evidence varies from person to Furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by UFOs visited by the ghost of Elvis and so Subject Einstein and God does not play dice Typical posting Albert Einstein believed in Do you think you're cleverer than him Response Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice with the universe This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian Used this way it is out of context it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum Furthermore Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the He believed that QM was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical So far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science Philosophy and Religion A Symposium published by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life New York In it he says The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural To be sure the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human In their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good the True and the Beautiful in humanity This is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy Einstein has also said It was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal The latter quote is from Albert Einstein The Human Side edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and published by Princeton University Also from the same book I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind Of course the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is Subject Everyone worships something Typical posting Everyone worships something whether it's money power or Response If that is true everyone is a Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care If the atheists' reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists' Subject Why there must be a causeless cause Typical posting Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless Response The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest Further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular Subject The universe is so complex it must have been designed Typical posting The presence of design in the universe proves there is a Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance Response This is known as the Argument From It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup for a There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate However the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called Scientific Furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos But if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist This leads us to the familiar theme of If a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator Indeed Stephen Hawking in his book A Brief History of Time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy in the so called Watchmaker One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally Of course one assumes a Yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all Arguments By Firstly a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather Secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn't assume it was created by the The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of Finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of Yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of The Watchmaker argument is thus internally Subject Independent evidence that the Bible is true Typical posting The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary For Response The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James the extant version discusses John in a non Christian Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing but that this was expanded by Christian Several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius about It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of ' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this Aside from the New Testament the biographical information about Jesus is more well For further information please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup Subject Godel's Incompleteness Theorem Typical posting Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and Response Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid 'true' or 'false' within that formal Technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal Essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a Liar The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is This sentence is Note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God are worthless in One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God simply by having the existence of God stated as an This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that However that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the Furthermore it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God the formal systems are just Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text the Bible the Book of Mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally Religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are Subject George Bush on atheism and patriotism Typical posting Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens Response The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush on August Sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for The discussion turned to the presidential primary RS What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists GB I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist Faith in God is important to RS Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists GB No I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered This is one nation under RS Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church GB Yes I support the separation of church and I'm just not very high on UPI reported on May that various atheist organizations were still angry over the The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February It can also be found in Free Enquiry magazine Fall issue Volume Number page On October Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane cochairman of the Bush Quayle ' Illinois This concerned a lawsuit Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District Chicago Illinois from forcing his first grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God Bush's phrase The following conversation took place RS American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing EM It's RS What is bullshit EM Everything that American Atheists does Rob is RS Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush campaign is on this EM You're After Bush's election American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his On February Boyden Gray Counsel to the President replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote As you are aware the President is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the For further information contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road Subject I know where hell is Typical posting I know where Hell is Hell is in Norway Response There are several towns called Hell in various countries around the world including Norway and the Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every Subject Biblical contradictions wanted Typical posting Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions Response American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the See the contacts file for more Subject The USA is a Christian nation Typical posting Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation Response Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian Here are some quotes there are many What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient A just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them James Madison A Memorial and Remonstrance I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced John Adams in a letter to Thomas Jefferson History I believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt I cannot conceive otherwise than that He the Infinite Father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that He is even infinitely above Benjamin Franklin from Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion Subject The USA is not a Christian nation Typical posting Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion Response The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the Treaty of Tripoli Stat Treaty Series Article As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of Musselmen and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the Senate on June and ratified by President John Adams on June It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks Article XI The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow Consul General at Algiers a close friend of Thomas Paine and an opponent of It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found it's hard to In a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the End of FAQ Digest
