From Charles Brasted Subject Re some DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes First I want to start right out and say that I'm a It makes sense to be Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar lunatic or the real thing I might be a little off on the title but he writes the Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity in the process he became a Christian I assume you are posting to encourage comments how much history has Tony Campello read Not much it The arguements he uses I am summing The book is about whether Jesus was God or I know many of you don't believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians If only those christian scientists would take In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of For example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he Or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion Did Tony follow that one up Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as Who would die for a lie Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been Millions of people have died for a lie This point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish The list is The Aztecs lost Call me a fool but I believe he did heal That is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a More to the point it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the real thing Niether was he a Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was Very doubtful in fact For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany More to the point did Tony mention this One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of Hitler was based I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a Some other things to He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in hrs This in his betrayal and I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use This is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in quoting the The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally For example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b I don't think most people understand what a Christian That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be It is certainly not what I see a lot in Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere But just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a We box everything into time Such as work at this time sports Tv social God is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for I think if you posted this part to you would get more flames than here I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other Someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the If I am pressed I could probably find the exact Cheers
