From Stan Friesen Subject Re After years can we say that Christian Morality is This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan In article Joseph Duffy writes In article Russ Paul Jones writes The same way that any theory is proven You examine the predicitions that the theory makes and try to observe If you don't or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen then you have some evidence against the If the theory can't be modified to incorporate the new observations then you say that it is But how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment In many types of experiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will happen again and be capable of being For example in chemistry someone may predict the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction There are several problems First you are discussing only experimental Observational procedures are also The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as yet unmade The observations could be the result of an experiment or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long All that matters is that the observations be new This is what prediction is about in science it is not about predicting the future except in this very restricted Secondly repeatability can also take many It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the The observation of a fossil is 'repeatable' since any qualified observer may look at it this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum Also there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current New fossils are found often enough that this is tested Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous Unfortunately for you the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now For instance the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed So in fact histoircal science findings are repeatable in the necessary Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does not make it impossible to make valid This is not to say that biologists would not go coo coo if extra terrestrial life were discovered that could make the determination of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy formerly tdatirv sarima or formerly tdatirv sarima or
