From Fred Rice Subject Re Islam And Scientific Predictions was Re Genocide is Caused by Atheism In Cynthia Kandolf writes Various quotes deleted in the interest of saving a little bit of bandwidth but i will copy the Koran quote AND IT IS HE GOD ALMIGHTY WHO CREATED THE NIGHT AND THE DAY AND THE SUN AND THE EARTH ALL THE CELETIAL BODIES SWIM ALONG EACH IN ITS ROUNDED Holy Quran As it has been pointed out this quote makes no claim about what orbits The idea that something orbited something had been held as true for many years before the Koran was written so the fact that it says something orbits something is hardly surprising My concern is with the word rounded There are two interpretations of this word It means in a This is wrong although many believed it to be true at the time the Koran was In other words it is not describing our neighborhood of the universe as it really exists but as it was thought to be at the This has implications which i hope are obvious to It means in a rounded shape which could include elipses the geometrical form which most nearly describes the orbits of the planets This is also not a great Look at the shapes you see in Very few of them even approach a square or rectangle those are human created Everything in nature is rounded to some Even the flat earthers don't try to claim Earth is a Children who draw imaginary animals seldom give them rectangular We seem to instinctively recognize that nature produces rounded shapes hence the assumption that the orbits of the planets would be round hardly takes divine It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original Regarding the verses relevant to nature I prefer to use Maurice Bucaille's translations in his book The Bible the Qur'an and Science for in general his translations are more Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as one is travelling with an orbit in its own Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation it is not existent in the original Arabic which is why it is included in Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of these interpretations at any rate neither one of them is exactly You're right what the verses do contain isn't all that However Bucaille a surgeon that's how he's a thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the century or And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well which has about verses or so regarding nature I think I remember reading Fred Rice
