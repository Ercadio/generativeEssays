From Kent Sandvik Subject Re islamic genocide so pick former Yugoslavia instead and say their problems are caused by communism it doesn't really But I guess religious leaders are calling for an end to that too so it can't be religiously This despite the fact that the Christians carve crosses in dead Muslims Maybe they just want Maybe its something else they Maybe the cross carvings are just I don't Just looks Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon against other And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors willing to use even Christianity as a weapon against their former Cheers Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the
