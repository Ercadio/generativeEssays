From Kevin Marshall Subject Re some DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as Who would die for a lie Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been Call me a fool but I believe he did heal Anyone who dies for a cause runs the risk of dying for a As for people being able to tell if he was a liar well we've had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of If David Copperfield had been the Messiah I bet he could have found plenty of Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer and he wasn't the first to be What sets him apart Niether was he a Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was Very doubtful in fact For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right Nations have followed crazies liars psychopaths and megalomaniacs throughout Hitler Tojo Mussolini Khomeini Qadaffi Stalin Papa Doc and Nixon come to from this Koresh is a non Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic There are flaws in your logic And as I'm sure others will tell you read the FAQ Some other things to He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in hrs This in his betrayal and I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use Of course you have to believe the Bible Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less So if you do quote from the Bible in the future try to back up that quote with supporting Otherwise you will get flamed I don't think most people understand what a Christian It is certainly not what I see a lot in Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere But just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a We box everything into time Such as work at this time sports Tv social God is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for Just like weight lifting or guitar playing eh I don't know how you define the world total but I would imagine a total sacrafice sp of everything for God's sake would involve more than a time You are correct about our tendency to box everything into time Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and hehehe television Kevin Marshall Computer Science Department Virginia Tech Blacksburg Virginia
