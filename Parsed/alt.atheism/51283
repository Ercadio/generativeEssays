From Ray Ingles Subject Homosexuality Was Re Princeton Sorry Bill I had to clear this There may be good evolutionary arguments against homosexuality but these don't In article Bill Conner writes wrote deletions It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function deletions So every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children wonder the world is Obviously you keep to the Monty Python song Every sperm is sacred And if as you say it has a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement Consider the context I'm talking about an evolutionary One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who don't have no purpose in that Oh I guess all those social insects ants bees which have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on the way out huh These days is just ain't true People can decide whether or not to have children and Soon they will be able to choose it's sex c but that's another so it's more of a lifestyle Again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not Both are as unnatural as each Yet another non Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is That homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary I refer you to the bonobos a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees that is very closely They have sex all the time homosexual as well as When the group finds food they have Before the go to sleep at night they have After they escape from or fight off prdators they have Sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this A species closely related to There is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans as well but even if not this shows that such a function is not impossible Sincerely Ray Ingles The meek can have the The rest of us are going to the stars Robert Heinlein
