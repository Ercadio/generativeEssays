From Jim Halat Subject Re After years can we say that Christian Morality is In article mathew writes Mark McCullough writes In article Jim Halat writes Atoms are not They aren't even What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical observable properties of our All of which is This deserves It really Atoms aren't even Tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are atoms now so what are they Figments of our imaginations The evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but I won't bother with most evidence at the HA HA HA Sorry but having studied cell biology I have to say that I can see it through an electron microscope THEREFORE it is real is a laughable Thank I thought I was in the twilight zone for a It still amazes me that many people with science backgrounds still confuse the models and observables with what even they would call the real jim halat In article Jim Halat writes In article datepper David Aaron Tepper writes You were a liberal arts major weren'tcha Guess you never saw that photo of the smallest logo in the world IBM made with noble gas atoms krypton xenon I forget the specifics Atoms trees electrons are all independently observable and Morals aren' See the difference Just for the record not that any kind of information would be likely to affect your thinking I have an MSEE focus in Electromagnetics from A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom What was observed is something we can measure that matches what the mathematical model we call an atom had Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and a wave model for light the atomic model is a mathematical representation of physical A model that can and probably will continue to change over That makes it subjective the model that is However the model gives us an objective way to talk about the physical To put it another way the Quantum Mechanical model of the atom allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and unambiguous results which is However as Bohr and Einstein duked it out mid century the interpretation of those reapeatable observable measurements is quite Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was inherent in the nature of the Einstein said particle motion was deterministic but it was our measurement shortcomings that introduced the They were talking about the EXACT same results jim halat
