From mathew Subject FAQ Constructing a Logical Argument Archive name atheism logic Alt atheism archive name logic Last modified April Version Constructing a Logical Argument Although there is much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument found is This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of Logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference Concise OED Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid Of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally The matter is very much open for This document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the Propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical A proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example It is raining or Today is Tuesday Propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false Note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday The proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express So God exists and There exists a God both express the same An argument is to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition An argument consists of three First of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are These are called the premises of the They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its Premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so The phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious If something doesn't seem obvious to you don't be afraid to question You can always say Oh yes you're right it is obvious when you've heard the Next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as In inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already There are various forms of valid The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of For example Every event has a cause premise The universe has a beginning premise All beginnings involve an event premise This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference Therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the This is perfectly valid if sometimes a little Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an Some statements look like arguments but are For example If the Bible is accurate Jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the Son of This is not an argument it is a conditional It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we'll come to those Another example God created you therefore do your duty to The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition since it is neither true nor Therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an Finally causality is Consider a statement of the form A because B If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence the statement is an If we're trying to establish the truth of B then it is not an argument it is an For example There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not This is an My car will not start because there is something wrong with the This is an There are two traditional types of argument deductive and A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be A deductive argument is either valid or A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor However we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion This is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more Obviously a valid argument can consist of true However an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false For example All insects have wings premise Woodlice are insects premise Therefore woodlice have wings conclusion Here the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are If the argument's premises were true however the conclusion would be The argument is thus entirely More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in All fish live in the sea premise Dolphins are fish premise Therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion However the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true We can therefore draw up a truth table for The symbol denotes implication A is the premise B the T and F represent true and false Premise Conclusion Inference A B A B F F T If the premises are false and the inference F T T valid the conclusion can be true or T F F If the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be T T T If the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are A sound argument therefore arrives at a true Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an These pitfalls are known as In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those This is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or So for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by The following list of fallacies is not intended to be ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM APPEAL TO FORCE The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a It is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the For example Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting For example Atheism is an evil It is practised by Communists and Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular For example It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes This is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a For example Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad You're This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved Or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific Examples Of course the Bible is Nobody can prove Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not Nobody has shown any proof that they are Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven Also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not For example A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the The earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the Therefore no such flood In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This is the Appeal to Pity also known as Special The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion For example I did not murder my mother and father with an Please don't find me guilty I'm suffering enough through being an ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This is known as Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive For example Pornography must be It is violence against The Bible must be Millions of people know that it Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an For example Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in This line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that For example we can distinguish quite clearly between Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer Hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be Searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is It is the error made when one goes from the general to the For example Christians generally dislike You are a Christian so you must dislike This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible For example Jim Bakker was an insincere Therefore all Christians are SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These are known as False Cause The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the For example I took an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache So God cured me of the The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the For example The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter It asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to Often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid For example Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government Note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual Another example is the classic We know that God exists because the Bible tells us And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This is the Fallacy of One example is the classic loaded question Have you stopped beating your wife The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been This trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like Where did you hide the money you stole Similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that For example a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are Sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same For example What could be more affordable than free software But to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical ACCENT Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting In this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are For example consider We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the For example The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those For example A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of Like its opposite it exists in two The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its For example You are studying at a rich Therefore you must be The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each For example Ants can destroy a Therefore this ant can destroy a THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first For example If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug addicts on Therefore we cannot legalize A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are Examples Isn't history based upon faith If so then isn't the Bible also a form of history Islam is based on faith Christianity is based on faith so isn't Islam a form of Christianity Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren't dogs a form of cat AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B B is true therefore A is true To understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false Again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa the latter has the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false where A does NOT in fact imply B at Here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B therefore if B then A ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that's the way it's always ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting BIFURCATION Also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex NON SEQUITUR A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with RED HERRING This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking Such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation How dare you TU QUOQUE This is the famous you too It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed For instance You're just being randomly So You've been abusive
