From Petri Pihko Subject Re Concerning God's Morality long This kind of argument cries for a wrote In article galahad Scott Compton writes Jim you originally wrote did not create disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of What God did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can Without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism God created the original genetic code perfect and without Do you have any evidence for this If the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldn't we Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing It appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon intron structure in their On the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are Moreover intron insertion would have required precise targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self splicing of mRNA are Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for Remember the question was posed in a theological context Why does God cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my It is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this I think you misread my I said God made the genetic code perfect but that doesn't mean it's perfect It has certainly evolved For the worse Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some In fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg I thought it was higher energy rays like X rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the In fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic Actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when God created According to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was It would still be too primitive to support I seem to remember a figure more like to billion years ago for the origination of life on Anyone with a better estimate I'd replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite like layers date back to billion This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to I'm sorry I can't give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended dominion it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and Although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset Again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration I can understand Scott's reaction Excuse me but this is so far fetched that I know you must be Do you know what pathogens are Do you know what Point Mutations are Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY In response to your last statement no and neither do You may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know I hope you don't forget this We have evidence that suggests everything can come about Do you have evidence against this conclusion In science one does not have to believe in It is a healthy sign to doubt and But the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one's own conclusions prior to Theology does not use this Therefore I seriously doubt it could ever come to right Human DNA being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and It is a bad Hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases You are supposing a purpose not a valid Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from We are just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and The less efficient methods didn't make it to the And for the last Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary Some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to I haven't seen much evidence for either But then I ask So Where is this relevant to my discussion in answering John's question of why Why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop Is it God's fault the original question I say no it is Of course nothing evil is god's But your explanation does not work it fails You may be But the fact is that you don't know that Satan is not responsible and neither do Suppose that a powerful evil being like Satan Would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind I don't think He could have done a much better Pun The problem is it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of Did I say that Where Seems to me like another bad Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new I never said that people are meant presumably by God to be punished by getting diseases Why I did say is that free moral choices have attendent If mankind chooses to reject God as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic I am not expecting If god exists I expect him to leave us I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed This is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear cut as it seems to What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah Oh I admit it's not perfect yet But I'm working on A good library or a bookstore is a good starting What does this have to do with the price of tea in China or the question to which I provided an answer Biology and Genetics are fine subjects and important scientific But they explain how God created and set up life They don't explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent Why is there a why behind And your proposition was something that is not supported by the This is why we recommend these Is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover Evidence for this If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories Hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this Thanks Scotty for your fine and sagely But I am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty details of biology and genetics although I'm sure I'd find it a fascinating For I realize that the details do not change the Big Picture that God created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its I'm sorry but they There is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of It can come into existence without a Supreme Try reading Atkins' Creation Revisited Freeman Petri ' '' Petri Pihko kem pmp
