From MANDTBACKA Mats Andtbacka Subject Re After years can we say that Christian Morality is In writes If some society came up with a good reason for why rape and murder are ok I would be consistent with my position and hold that it was still My basis of morality is not on societal norms or on current My basis is surprise surprise on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences AH But what exactly is inherently abhorrent and WHY is it so What you're saying is in effect I think some things are repulsive and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me so they should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever period Which in and of itself is nice enough to some extent I agree with But I do not agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely' immoral they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason and if the reason can even theoretically change then so can the Yes that's vague and the only way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans are similarly Yes that falls into the trap of creation No it doesn' Humans are to some extent similar because we all belong to the same species that that species has evolved is another story To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism of a flavour My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust goodness love respect courage and honesty in any society rather than deceipt hatred disrespect cowardness and You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and It is I think up to a point but societies are not all alike and neither are their No I haven't been everywhere and seen everyone but according to my thesis I don't have to since I hold that we were all created Similar If that makes an unfalsifiable thesis just say so and I'll both work out what I can and punt to fellow No it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was created different whatever that might be in the real Disclaimer It's great to be young and insane
