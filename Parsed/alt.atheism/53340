From Turin Turambar ME Department of Utter Misery Subject Re Faith and Dogma In article Todd Kelley writes In light of what happened in Waco I need to get something of my Sadly Faith and dogma are Religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason I scorn To be fair you should really qualify this as semitic western religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on I have expressed this notion in the Some Christians debated with me whether Christianity leaves any room for I claimed rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and Again this should really be evaluated at a personal For example there was only one Jesus presumably and he probably didn't say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of Christian sects have Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in It would seem to go against the Bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any This is a good We have here the quintessential Christian he sets up a system of values beliefs for himself which work very well and every event experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this However we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests In other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a I claimed that a Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those of Consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a Can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison Can we define a Christian to be someone who at the moment has Christian beliefs No because if a person is free to go he is not a Similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not a Interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always I will admit and probably it is the mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant I admit it's a word I'm going by the dictionary definition of religion religion concern over what exists beyond the visible world differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith or intuition rather than reason '' Webster's Now let's go beyond the word I don't claim that religion causes I think that if all humans were atheist there would still be There will always be humans who don't There will always be humans who don't ask themselves what is the REAL difference between themselves and people with different colored skin or a different language or different Granted Religion is like the gun that doesn't kill Religion encourages faith and dogma and although it doesn't directly condemn people it encourages the use of just because'' It is just because'' thinking that kills In which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if I may be so bold as to extend your similie Sure religion has many good It encourages benevolence and OK so take out only the bad things like faith dogma and Put in the good things like careful reasoning and The result is secular Wouldn't it be nice if everyone were a secular humanist To please the supernaturalists you might even leave God in there but the secular emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesn't put anyone further ahead in understanding the universe OK I'm just poking fun at the supernaturalists Also Of course not all humans are capable of thought and we'd still have genocide and maybe even some mass not as I'm willing to bet on Todd Todd Kelley Department of Computer Science University of Toronto best regards Adam John Cooper Verily often have I laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no
