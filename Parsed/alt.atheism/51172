From Nanci Ann Miller Subject Re Concerning God's Morality long writes Sorry but there are no supernatural forces necessary to create a You are saying Since diseases are bad the bad entity must have created So what would you say about acid rain meteors falling from the sky volcanoes earthquakes and other QUOTE UNQUOTE Acts of God I would say that they are not acts of God but natural It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of God and then in the same post say that these other processes volcanos et are natural Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are natural processes and what are direct acts of God How do you know that God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in the Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook God's If we choose to live apart from God's law humanity collectively then it should come as no surprise that there are adverse consequences to our collective One of these is that we are left to deal with disease and disorders which inevitably result in an entropic May I ask where is this 'collective' bullcrap coming from By collective I was referring to the idea that God works with humanity on two levels individually and If mankind as a whole decides to undertake a certain action the majority of mankind then God will allow the consequences of that action to affect mankind as a Adam Eve TWO PEOPLE even tho they had the honor or so you christians claim of being the first two definitely do NOT represent a majority in the billions and trillions probably more of people that have come after Perhaps they were the majority then but I and YOU weren't around to vote and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to do with that But your god never asked He just assumes that if you have two bad people then they ALL must be Sounds like the same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting here resorting So THAT's where they get shoulda Jim Nanci If you know and are SURE of the author of this quote please send me email Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to
