From I Benedikt Rosenau Subject Ontology was Benediktine Metaphysics In article Charley Wingate writes IF IT IS CONTRADICTORY IT CANNOT Contradictory is a property of If I correct this to THINGS DEFINED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST No need to correct it it stands as it is I will object to definitions as If you then amend it to THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST then we've come to something which is plainly Failures in description are merely failures in You miss the point Things defined by contradictory language do not Though something existing might be meant conclusions drawn from the description are wrong unless there is the possibility to find the described and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described Another possibility is to drop the contradictory part but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as I'm not an objectivist Neither am But either things are directly sensed which includes some form of modelling by the way or they are used in Using something contradictive in modelling is not approved Wonder why We remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed as An important point is that either one manages to resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions or one will fall in the garbage in garbage out Benedikt
