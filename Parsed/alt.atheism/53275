From Subject Re Origins of the bible In article A , A Wainwright writes Hi, I have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with a theist acquaintance He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered at a certain point in time which were syllable perfect This therefore meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted by my acquaintace was approximately years after the death of Jesus Hi Adda, Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time the time when the author wrote it Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies Cutting all of the crap out of the way ie god wrote it could anyone answer the following How old is the oldest surviving copy of the new testament There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century A D There are some complete books, letters, etc from the middle third century The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early th century A D Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings Is there any truth in my acquaintance's statements If you mean that someone discovered thousands of Bibles which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the st century No If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the dates given above, but not letter perfect and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime shortly after A D , then yes From who where did the bible originate From the original authors We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, James, and one other not identified How long is a piece of string As long as you make it Adda Regards, Jim B
