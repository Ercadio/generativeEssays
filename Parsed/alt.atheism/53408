From Jon Livesey Subject Re islamic genocide In article frank Frank O'Dwyer writes In article Jon Livesey writes False You claimed the killing were not religiously motivated and I'm saying that's I'm not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out in Which killings do you say are religously motivated For example I would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA was probably religously At the time of writing I think that someone who claims the current violence is motivated by religion is What would you call is when someone writes The killings in are not religously motivated Now it's possible to argue that religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in the present but I don't know of any evidence that this is so and I'm not enough of a historian to debate Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland into a country that has a particular church written into its constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated by that Church I fail to see why the word past is But to claim that The killings in are not religously is All that means is that the Church and believers are doing what they always do with history they can't face they rewrite You're attacking a different My claim is that when an IRA terrorist plants a bomb in Warrington s he does not have as a motive the greater glory of Sorry Frank but what I put in quotes is your own words from your posting Don't tell us now that it's a different If you can no longer stand behind your original claim just say I mean the same thing when I say The killings in are not religously motivated as I do when I say when a terrorist plants a bomb s he doesn't have a religious The example is meant to clarify not to be a new The different claim to which I refer is the claim which you were seemingly attacking in the previous post namely that religion is not a major historical cause of the present I don't assert that nor do I assert its You don't have to hand us a bunch of double talk about what I was seemingly I quoted what I was
