From Subject Re Death Penalty Gulf War In article mathew writes writes In article mathew writes Fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o thousands of Iraqis in order to liberate oil H H We won the war hurrah hurrah The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century Let's analyze this claim a How is the size of a war defined By number of participants Geographical area Number of countries involved Number of casualties Size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical Which other comparable wars are we talking about Vietnam and Korea might make good Which liberal news media are we talking about Western news in general but in particular the American mass media CBS NBC ABC The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only I suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it I How about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in I don't hear you bemoaning them Perhaps because the topic hasn't cropped If you want my opinion I think that the blanket bombing of German cities at the end of World War Two was the most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in Bomber Harris was no hero of Perhaps And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake But that's easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 's right Back then it was all out war and Germany and Japan had to be After all a million or more British had already died hundreds of thousands of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and millions of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and other people of slavic descent in German concentration All things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied I for one don't regret War is never an exact science but with smart bombs it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian Sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents That's war the way it really Entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really And it's the people who suffer because of All the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet If Iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the It is evident that the West especially America misjudged Hussein But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he had to be Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait but it is still Hussein who is responsible for his decision to And once he did so a strong response from the West was Mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base You come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although I feel sure that was not your What's your intent To sound like a Loving Christian Well you aren't doing a very good job of Well it's not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their So I'd have to say yes stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military So the Iraqi war was wrong eh I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in eh Who even mentioned appeasement And what makes you think the situation is even remotely analogous to World War Two I mentioned If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have been It is precisely the lessons the world learned in that motivated the Western alliance to Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop from happening and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi I guess we shouldn't have fought either just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Yes Germans are human too you What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich The consequences stemmed from Tyrants like Hussein have to be His kind don't understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice not to mention the Americans who died was for I look forward to hearing your incisive comments about East Timor and What should I say about them Anything in particular And as for poor poor Rodney King Did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty Amongst the things I thought were Hmm there's an awful lot of white people in that So It was the policemen on trial not Rodney King And under American law they deserved a jury of their peers If there had been black officers involved I'm sure their would have been black jurors This point of allegedly racial motivations is really Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video But the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and I have not When I see a bunch of policemen beating someone who's lying defenceless on the ground it's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have So It's hard to imagine So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical Argument Can we expect another revision soon Just If there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret Why not tell everyone what it is Then everyone could say Oh yes you're right King deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever I have to admit that I wonder this But neither the prosecution nor the defense is So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a Fine but I'm still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt was in this I mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone who's lying defenceless on the What's your explanation Mass hallucination Orbital mind control lasers Faked video footage Do It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force And frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily A charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under California Based on what the prosecution was asking for it's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty Note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily The seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable mathew Thou shalt not unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it cannot be Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians Thanks mathew I like the Pretty funny I'm a Monty Python fan you Kind of seems in that Of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem But then you know that Regards Jim Loving Christian
