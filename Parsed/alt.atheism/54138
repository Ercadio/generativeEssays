From I Benedikt Rosenau Subject Re It's all Mary's fault In article William Briggs writes Deletion Lucky for them that the baby didn't have any obvious deformities I could just see it now Mary gets pregnant out of wedlock so to save face she and Joseph say that it was God that got her pregnant and then the baby turns out to be deformed or even worse stillborn They'd have a lot of explaining to A few points guys oops guy and gal but I use the term guy asexually Has the same sort of conspiracy ever occurred since I mean there must have been dozen of times in the past two thousand years when it would have been opportune time for a 'messiah' to be It There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have been conceived His mother says the His father is said to be a bit But anyway there have been a lot of Messiahs and many have had a similar story about their Or their A list of Messiahs could be quite Wouldn't you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of Christ was via God I can just imagine your faces as Mary asks you if you've ever had a child I would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing evidence for everyone to And the whole question is Wouldn't you feel bad if you'd find out that stones are sentient and that you have stepped on them all your life And wouldn't you feel bad when you'd see the proof that Jesus was just a plot of Satan If they wanted to save image they could have done what Joseph planned to do in the first place have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce I think it was quite easy to do under Jewish law In that regard they would have been pretty DUMB to think up a conspiracy like the one you've outlined in that they a bringing attention on Messiah appearances were like Royal Scandals in zero AD Israel see the part in Acts when the Sandhedrin are discussing what to do about the growth of the new Church one wise guy said leave it alone and if it is what it says it is nothing can stop it and if it isn't then it will just fizzle out anyway You've forgotten the pride It didn't fizzle the Church I mean The argument is a It is like thanks for reading this far on the end of a Most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain some eternal So does Since there are old religions it is no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would Roll twelve Calculate the chance for the Argue that there must be something special about the result because an event with a chance of could hardly happen by chance Feel elevated because you have participated in letting that special event take Benedikt
