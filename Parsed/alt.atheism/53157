From Dave Fuller Subject Re Death Penalty was Re Political Atheists The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court battles have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should Hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to If so why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty That would be effictive wouldn't it The death penalty is a punishment much like a fine for speeding is a Anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care about the I think another problem is that people dont think they will get If I wanted to kill another person I wouldn't care what the penalty was if I didn't think I would get If it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along the lines of Dave Fuller
