From frank Frank O'Dwyer Subject Re Bayesian Statistics theism and atheism In article Simon Clippingdale writes In article frank Frank O'Dwyer writes In article Simon Clippingdale writes I write Imagine that Alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every Suppose further that this money is being paid to you by a your big hearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian Let's suppose that this is a true dichotomy so P a P b Trouble is Alterius is in a different universe so that no observations of Alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn't possibly afford it Now let's examine the case for a There is no evidence whatsoever that there is any such thing as a big hearted Alterian However P exists b h A b P not exists b h A b On the grounds that lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a Turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that On the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b The problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it can't because we have dismissed all of its potential That's an extremely poor argument and here's Premise money is being paid to you by either a your big hearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian ATM Thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an observation on Alterius and by construction is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the ATM Premise no observations on Alterius are except for the banks you couldn't possibly afford it You forgot to include My premise is actually Premise The cardinality of the set of possible observations on Alterius is This is clearly contradictory to the Not if you state it Trouble is on the basis of premise you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug Voila a screaming with my highlights SC But in a strawman There is only evidence for OneOf Benefactor Bug No observation to distinguish Benefactor from Bug is That is not evidence for Bug and neither is it evidence for Nor is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as if there were no Benefactor Bug two statements both would be false This is still It reduces to Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for bug meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the other therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug But relies on a shift in meaning from When you say paraphrased in that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that it's no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug Yes that's what I In however you've shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute' evidence for benefactor rather than relative' evidence for benefactor bug Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the I think this is just a communications What I am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your 'Rapture' example I don't buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A In my example one couldn't dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary to explain the I brought up the 'one by one dismissal' process to show that it would be wrong to do From what you're saying in this post it seems you agree and we're talking at cross is still in contradiction to Some sums may With B benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account implies P B b d Assuming that P Bb d so it's either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then P B b d P B d P b d so P B d P b d but implies that P B d and P b d No this isn't what I P B d and P b d with necessarily no new observation we've already seen the dosh to change those I was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign probability to either of And that's precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise would not be satisfactorily It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non rational preference not of science or Alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer can't be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticism weak atheism As they do when the set M is filled by the universe is caused by x where x is gods pink unicorns nothing and no observation tends to one conclusion over the Exactly the point I was making I So we don't throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we Some people do Simon and they think they are doing excellent My sole point was that they aren' Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H i x where P x H i can cause P H i to go to zero after a finite number of Only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypotheses Exactly my point though I may have been You said the diametric opposite which I guess is the source of my I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing What I'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for all or perhaps any versions of theism and it isn't true that those for which it does not hold can be discarded using the On the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the See my post on the other branch of this Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me If the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like Which means that you're assigning P x H i for all i though we've already established that it's not correct to do so when SUM P x H i over all Simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or non existence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and at worst barking Luckily I make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here would you Frank Although that doesn't of course rule out my being barking mad in any case I could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to Cleese et al But I think you miss the point once When I say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesn't imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of P H data to If it reduces this quantity it's still evidence against No I got I'm talking about the case when A You're clearly correct when A And I'm not constructing a strawman though it's certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying However by any standards a system that says when A gods are highly unlikely and when A gods can be dismissed using the Razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all In my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon close If that's not what you're saying then please put me
