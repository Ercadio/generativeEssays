From Gregg Jaeger Subject Re An Anecdote about Islam In article I Benedikt Rosenau writes In article Gregg Jaeger writes A brutal system filtered through leniency is not Huh How do you rate public floggings or floggings at all Chopping off the hands heads or other body parts What about stoning I don't have a problem with floggings particularly when the offenders have been given a chance to change their behavior before floggings are I do have a problem with maiming in general by whatever In my opinion no one who has not maimed another should be In the case of rape the victim is maimed physically and emotionally so I wouldn't have a problem with maiming Obviously I wouldn't have a problem with maiming murderers May I ask if you had the same opinion before you became a Muslim Yes I You see I don't think that rape and murder should be dealt with You being so interested in leniency for leniency's sake apparently think that people should simply be told the did a bad And what about the simple chance of misjudgements Misjudgments should be avoided as much as I suspect that it's pretty unlikely that given my requirement of repeated offenses that misjudgments are very Orient is not a place having a single Your ignorance exposes itself nicely Read carefully I have not said all the Orient shows primitive Well then why not use more specific words than Orient Probably because in your mind there is no need to it's all the same Because it contains sufficient While more detail is possible it is not And Europe shows civilized This is Time to put out or shut You've substantiated nothing and are blabbering on like Islamists who talk about the West as the Great You're both guilty of I just love to compare such lines to the common plea of your fellow believers not to call each others In this case to substantiate it The Quran allows that one beATs one's wife into Really Care to give chapter and verse We could discuss Primitive Machism refers to I have misspelt that before my fault Again not all of the Orient follows the Qur' So you'll have to do better than Sorry you haven't put out Islam expresses extramarital Extramarital sex is a subset of It is suppressedin That marial sexis allowed or encouraged in Islam as it is in many branches of Christianity too misses the Read the part about the urge for sex Religions that run around telling people how to have sex are not my piece of cake for two reasons Suppressing a strong urge needs strong measures and it is not their business Believe what you I thought you were trying to make an All I am reading are It is an That you doubt the validity of the premises does not change If you want to criticize it do Time for you to put up or shut This is an argument for why you don't like religions that suppress A such it's an irrelevant If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then My response is then you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion one of your arguments The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage Gregg
