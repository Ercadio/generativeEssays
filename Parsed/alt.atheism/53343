From Gregg Jaeger Subject Re Yet more Rushdie Re ISLAMIC LAW In article bobbe Robert Beauchaine writes In article Gregg Jaeger writes This supports I have no reason to believe that this is piece is anything other than another anti Islamic slander I have no respect for titles only for real I can look up this article if I want But I can tell you BCCI was not an Islamic Seeing as I'm spending my time responding to propaganda in responding to this little sub thread I really don't feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the effect that the propaganda is If someone wants to discuss the issue more seriously then I'd be glad to have a real discussion providing references But you must admit that this is a more thorough argument supporting a proposition than your 'it's propganda because I say so' I hope you can see why we might not find this argument If you want to refute a point then do so but do it Well again I am doing as much as the poster I was replying I am quite busy and really don't have the time to respond in full scholarly form to every accusation that is flippantly made by someone who's being clearly And have you ever considered that perhaps these people actually believe what they say That they are not just spreading propaganda I have considered But if someone spreads falsehoods out of ignorance then they are still spreading Those falsehoods generally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people who know that what they are saying is at least not the whole I still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda on some I'm not in a position to say since I know nothing about the That does not in my estimation qualify me as having my head up my Bob I never accused you of having your head up your ass It takes me quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of having their head up their I was accusing the original poster Benedikt I believe of being so Cheers Gregg
