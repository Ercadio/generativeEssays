From Subject Re Death Penalty Gulf War long In article mathew writes writes In article mathew writes Which liberal news media are we talking about Western news in general but in particular the American mass media CBS NBC ABC The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits Most Over here there was very little about the suffering of the Iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few remaining quality At first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their But later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in It's like they were only pro Gulf War as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military HQs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping What naive hypocrites How about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in I don't hear you bemoaning them discussion about blanket bombing and A bombs All things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied I should have said here militarily justified It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified I What about the evidence that America knew Japan was about to surrender after Hiroshima but before Nagasaki Is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy I have often wondered about I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of A good inpenatrable military The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need But I Yes I have heard that we found evidence after the war BTW that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first Unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's Therefore the second bomb was Most unfortunate I for one don't regret Nuke a Jap for Jesus I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent But I do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the suffering caused by those Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet If Iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the It is evident that the West especially America misjudged Hussein But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he had to be Oh I So we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas guzzling car well the man's gotta Actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied If some back water country took over some other back water country we probably wouldn't Not that we don't care but we can't be the world's Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests caused us to take I've moved a paragraph from here to later on If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have been But did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action Or are you just setting up a strawman I'm not setting up a strawman at If you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were I guess we shouldn't have fought either just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Yes Germans are human too you What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich The consequences stemmed from Translation They were asking for it Well in a sense They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation But what about those who didn't support Hitler's dreams of conquest It's not as if they democratically voted for all his The NSDAP got in the elections of and that was the last chance the German people got to vote on the They suffered along with the Why does this bother you so much The world is full of evil and circumstances are not Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of It it regretable but that's The Way It There are no perfect I look forward to hearing your incisive comments about East Timor and What should I say about them Anything in particular The people of East Timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that invaded their Hell even Western journalists have been All this was happening before the Gulf Why didn't we send in the bombers to East Timor Why aren't we sending in the bombers NOW Probably because we're not the saviors of the We can't police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other Here's that paragraph I moved What's your intent To sound like a Loving Christian Well you aren't doing a very good job of Well it's not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their So I'd have to say yes stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military The Chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of Tibetan people are rounded up tortured and Amnesty International recently reported that torture is still widespread in Why aren't we stopping them In fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support I for one do not agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put I agree that it is And as for poor poor Rodney King Did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty Amongst the things I thought were Hmm there's an awful lot of white people in that So It was the policemen on trial not Rodney King Erm surely it's irrelevant who's on trial Juries are supposed to represent a cross section of the Are they Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in I'm not an expert on California law or even US law but it seems that this is the way the system is set You can criticize the system but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown And under American law they deserved a jury of their peers You are saying that black people are not the peers of white people No not at The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally This point of allegedly racial motivations is really This idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really Should the Nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made up of Nazis Germans Peers doesn't mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge It means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation s Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video But the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and I have not When I see a bunch of policemen beating someone who's lying defenceless on the ground it's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have So It's hard to imagine So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical Argument We're not talking about a logical We're talking about a court of As the FAQ points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in a court of OK However you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this This is not a court of If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable Were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy The media is not totally Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the MacNeil Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to Hurrah for Rush BTW I never used the word conspiracy I don't accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news Thou shalt not unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it cannot be Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians Thanks mathew I like the Pretty funny I'm a Monty Python fan you Kind of seems in that Of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem But then you know that Ha ha only I an atheist am arguing against killing innocent You a supposed Christian are arguing that it's OK to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as I didn't say that it's a Good Thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect If one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and I didn't say it is OK it is unfortunate but sometimes I a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of German cities at the end of World War II was as far as I can see an evil and unnecessary I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors And perhaps it was unnecessary as let's say we now That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with But don't assume that I feel the bombing was morally justified I don't I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult You having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that I am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral I as an absolutist am in a position to judge but I defer You are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral They were neither moral then nor They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the I simply refuse to condemn them for their Where's your Christian love Where's your absolute morality Oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits As Ivan Stang would say Jesus would puke One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this I understand the full ramifications of that and I am prepared to do I don't believe that you can make the same mathew And BTW the reason I brought up the blanket bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that But in the Gulf War precision bombing was the So the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in Even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air The stories of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain Yes The US lost servicemen in over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting But we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian Iraqis died in a war lasting about months And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that What If hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people not due to the Allied Regards
