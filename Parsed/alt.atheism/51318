From Fred Rice Subject Re Islam Dress Code for women In I Benedikt Rosenau writes In article Fred Rice writes Deletion Of course people say what they think to be the religion and that this is not exactly the same coming from different people within the There is nothing with there existing different perspectives within the religion perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on the My point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the And that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and Even when there might be a 'True Religion' at the core the layers above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane What you post then is supposed to be an answer but I don't see what is has got to do with what I I will repeat Religions as are harm And religions don't converge they Giving more to disagree And there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at Ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to So do you also oppose all ideologies I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human Big deletion Do women have souls in Islam People have said here that some Muslims say that women do not have I must admit I have never heard of such a view being held by Muslims of any I have heard of some Christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not Are you sure you might not be confusing Christian history with Islamic history Yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the Turkish I would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to Anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the Qur' For example the Qur'an says For Muslim men and women for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in God's praise For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great Qur'an Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation There are other quotes too but I think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very No it does It implies that they have souls but it does not say they have And it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all One must approach the Qur'an with Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven Or to have a great reward understood to be in the after life I think the usual answer would be no in which case the part saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then I have no idea what a soul As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal That is because according to Muslim belief the whole Qur'an is the revelation of God in fact denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Quite similar to you other post even when the Quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to It is a non Look any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's In a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide I think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have souls from the above verse Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends something I do not deny but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam Fred Rice
