From Mike Cobb Subject Re Societally acceptable behavior In qvh tINN Jonathan W Newton writes In article C qGM DL , Mike Cobb writes Merely a question for the basis of morality Moral Ethical behavior Societally acceptable behavior I disagree with these What society thinks should be irrelevant What the individual decides is all that is important This doesn't seem right If I want to kill you, I can because that is what I decide Who is society I think this is fairly obvious Not really If whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok, there are always some in the society who disagree with the mandates, so which societal mandates make the standard for morality How do they define what is acceptable Generally by what they feel is right, which is the most idiotic policy I can think of So what should be the basis Unfortunately I have to admit to being tied at least loosely to the feeling , in that I think we intuitively know some things to be wrong Awfully hard to defend, though How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position By thinking for ourselves I might agree here Just because certain actions are legal does not make them moral MAC Michael A Cobb and I won't raise taxes on the middle University of Illinois class to pay for my programs Champaign Urbana Bill Clinton rd Debate With new taxes and spending cuts we'll still have billion dollar deficits Michael A Cobb and I won't raise taxes on the middle University of Illinois class to pay for my programs Champaign Urbana Bill Clinton rd Debate Nobody can explain everything to anybody G K Chesterton
