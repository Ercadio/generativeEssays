From I Benedikt Rosenau Subject Re Theism and Fanatism was Islamic Genocide In article frank Frank O'Dwyer writes Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in Irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with deletion Theism is correlated with I have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to The point is theism increases the chance of becoming a One could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be I just said that theism is not the only factor for The point is that theism is a Gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable And the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these They are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are That's a claim you have to Please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they Now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism I grant To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious Ever read Animal Farm That's a straw And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by The point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of Gullibility by the way is one of And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw Interesting that you have nothing better to Define irrational belief is it rational to believe that reason is always useful Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon The latter has been discussed for a long time with Charley One point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable Well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be Which is it That's Self reference is not And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore The first part of the second statement contains no information because you don't say what the beliefs If the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general The second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually I exist is derived if you want it that Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of what is it you are trying to say Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but I can't agree with this until you are specific which theism To say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which I suspect you do not Using the traditonal definition of Personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this Usually connected to morals and or the way the world The affinity to fanatism is easily It has to be true because I believe it is nothing more than a work However the beliefs say they are more than a work I don't understand Can you formalise your argument Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so That does not make B true it is at best a work However the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B already believed says it is wronG a waste of time not Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites Idolaters Protestants are to be killed this can have interesting Answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like they would agree on a football being a Benedikt
