From Todd Kelley Subject Re Faith and Dogma Kevin Marshall wrote I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion but I disagree with your Faith Dogma Religion Faith Dogma Religion Bad Bad Religion Unfortunately you never state why faith and dogma are Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone which by its nature is without That is what I mean by the word faith'' belief without justification or belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational For example when someone says that God exists that they don't know why they believe God exists they can just feel it that's Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information or increased mental So Christians are totally irrational Irrational with respect to their religion only What are you saying One's belief in a Christian God does not make one totally I think I know what you were getting at but I'd rather hear you expand on the Faith and dogma are The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any If that makes the much overused in this context Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion I can live with Science is not a religion because there is no faith nor A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a Christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any Again this statement is too A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing his her Faith in God is a belief and all beliefs may Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists If a philosopher is not an atheist s he tends to be called a A Christian tends to consider Christianity Christianity is a special set of beliefs sanctioned by God himself and therefore to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Faith comes into Dogma comes into The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are Sure interpretations of what God said'' are changed to satisfy the needs of society but when God says something that's It was said and that's Since God said it it is unflawed even if the interpretations are Science as would be practiced by atheists in contrast has a BUILT IN defence against faith and A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time AND AND AND a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some The goal is to keep improving the The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently That's the only rational thing to That's good Can you see the difference Science views beliefs as being flawed and new information can be obtained to improve How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything None it would put them out of a job Religion views its beliefs as being perfect and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with Please explain how just because thinking kills And please state more in your answer than It's easier for someone to kill a person when s he doesn't require a good rational justification of the I don't consider he's Jewish'' or he was born of Jewish parents'' or this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational By the way I wasn't aware mass suicide was a Waco and Jonestown were isolated Mass suicides are far from Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you Todd
