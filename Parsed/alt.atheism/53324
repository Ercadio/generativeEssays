From Jim Perry Subject Re Is Morality Constant was Re Biblical Rape My last response in this thread fell into a bit bucket and vanished though appearing locally I'll repost it since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread I don't want Rob to think I'm doing Since this is now dated however don't feel compelled to In article strom Rob Strom writes I was making two separate points both of which attack face value Bible interpretation To judge the Bible's value today you judge it based on the way it is used That is what do commentators actually say what do rabbis teach I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value To judge the Bible's value when originally written you a read it in the context of its time not with today's assumptions and b compare it to the practices of surrounding While the context of the time is important value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some base standard relative stability success of a society This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people for instance according to the Bible the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman We need to look rather at what those peoples were really For instance in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue By the Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people relative to the people in the and Now in the past our ancestors did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from their earlier barbarism and made the transition to modern civilized paper cutting that much Sounds good but it presupposes teeth rending neighbors which I see no support One can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesn't mean that the actual neighbors really were More to the point such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or even of a different people dwelling among us is all too That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here for instance claiming that Hammurabi's an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way As of years ago or so they probably both meant the same To be sure I'm arguing from a parochial I belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe and this book is the book of my The book commands us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the world and to set an example as a light to the nations We've revered the book and I think we've been successful as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders in important humanitarian It's hard for me to separate the success of my people from the virtue of our You'd have to argue that we'd have done significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book has done significantly I don't belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual ones of the Jewish I have given up on trying to think by analogy since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all similar the closest I can think of are the Romany but I don't know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison I think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation is a good I think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a Captain America comic or whatever the Babylonian equivalent would have been Jim Perry Decision Support Matthews NC These are my For a nominal fee they can be Jim Perry Decision Support Matthews NC These are my For a nominal fee they can be
