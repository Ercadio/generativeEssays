From Bill Conner Subject Re Is Morality Constant was Re Biblical Rape Jim Perry wrote Xenophobia both de facto and de jure as implemented in legal systems is widespread while the Bible although not egalitarian specifically preaches kindness to the stranger and emphasizes in the Book of Ruth that a foreigner can join the nation and give rise to one of the great heroes of the Clearly better than the alternative but as an American what strikes me as strange about this story is that it should have even been considered an Jim There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology everything is random nothing is This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it's just a happy For an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment from teaching training observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more content is of no The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a How then can an atheist judge value What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned It seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose What law of nature can you invoke to establish your Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of The only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn't like it that's Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that That your objections seem well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned there is no truth The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual I didn't make these rules it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent you have to accept the non significance of any human thought even your All of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil and cannot Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight Bill
