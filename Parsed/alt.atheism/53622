From frank Frank O'Dwyer Subject Re Theism and Fanatism was Islamic Genocide In article I Benedikt Rosenau writes In article frank Frank O'Dwyer writes Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in Irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with deletion Theism is correlated with I have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to The point is theism increases the chance of becoming a One could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be I just said that theism is not the only factor for The point is that theism is a That's your claim now back it I consider your argument as useful as the following Belief is strongly correlated with Therefore belief is a factor in True and utterly Note this is any belief not belief in Gods Tiring to say the I have backed it up read the first I have read Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or The latter is the fallacy of the wrong Saying someone believes something is hardly an information about the person at Saying someone is a theist holds much more Further the correlation between theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special features of theistic Truth by blatant Evidence Gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable And the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these They are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are That's a claim you have to Please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they If you believe that you're incredibly You Frank O'Dwyer are living in a dream I wonder if there is any base of discussion left after such a As a matter of fact I think you are ignorant of human Even when one starts with something one does not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one To give you the benefit of the doubt prove your The onus of proof is on you What makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say Especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite The practice is not restricted to theism but it's there for anyone to It's almost an epidemic in this Just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye of a needle why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land owner Why are there churches to the square inch in my country Now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism I grant To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious Ever read Animal Farm That's a straw And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by The point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of No some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some Your last statement simply isn't implied by what you say before because you're trying to sneak in innate features of all theism The word you're groping for is some Bogus Not all theism as is is However the rest already gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and And further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them to switch to fanatism It takes just a nifty improvement in the Truth by blatant Gullibility by the way is one of No shit So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people causing the And the whole discussion started that way by the statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you Indeed I As I recall I asked for What is the correlation of which you speak And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw Interesting that you have nothing better to I said it reads like a warm up to That's because it's an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice Them Us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church Blah blah I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights protects me better from fanatics than the other way Of course other people are always fanatics never Your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between that argument and the rise of So far it is just another of your So You can do Define irrational belief is it rational to believe that reason is always useful Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon The latter has been discussed for a long time with Charley One point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable Well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be Which is it That's Self reference is not And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is it's It's still begging the question And though that certainly is allowed it's not And you claiming to be rational and Another of your No proof no evidence just Hey I learned it from Did I do good At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn't hear a refutation before so we're Deal with it you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is Someone who thinks reason is crap won't buy it you That is unusually weak even for The latter implies that my proof depends on their Somehow who does not accept that there are triangles won't accept Wow that's an incredible I don't have to prove them wrong in their It is possible to show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims unreliable or even absurd statements to be Totally circular and totally Their wish to believe makes them Things are judges by their appeal and not by their It makes you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible From belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they Truth by blatant I've seen as many bogus proofs of the non existence of gods as I have of their Rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not contradict It easily follows that such a system does not allows to evaluate if its rational in Yes it is possible to evaluate that it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as little impact as the possibility of a demon ala This just doesn't parse So far it just a matter of I use ratiional arguments to show that my system is consistent or that theirs isn' The evaluation of the Nor predictions does not need It does not contradict Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore Anybody else think Godel was silly Stream of consciousness typing What is that supposed to mean The first part of the second statement contains no information because you don't say what the beliefs If the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general The second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually I exist is derived if you want it that Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of what is it you are trying to say That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at Example I am not dreaming There is evidence for The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions that are necessary to get information out of the system I'd like to see this alleged One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all that's not how one feels about it I You have no irrational But then fanatics never do do they Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but I can't agree with this until you are specific which theism To say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which I suspect you do not Using the traditonal definition of Personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this Usually connected to morals and or the way the world IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily That does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of Some atheists are also scientists for They don't use theism when doing Or it wouldn't be Please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as They just prohibit formulating them as objective Ergo nothing is Fair The affinity to fanatism is easily It has to be true because I believe it is nothing more than a work However the beliefs say they are more than a work I don't understand Can you formalise your argument Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so That does not make B true it is at best a work However the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B already believed says it is wronG a waste of time not Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites Idolaters Protestants are to be killed this can have interesting Peculiar definition of interesting but Now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you Why aren't my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example Maybe they don't believe in Maybe it's the conjunction of B asserts B and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely It certainly seems so to me but then I have no axe to grind The example with your neighbours is a That your neighbours don't says little about And there were times when exactly that Nope it's not a It just doesn't go to the correlation you wish to And tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books Please note that one could edit them out when they are not relevant Because gods don't err What does that say about that message Excuse me THE Holy Books And how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are A god is the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attracting to Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can have on the rest of the Happens again and again and A god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only Frank O'Dwyer 'I'm not
