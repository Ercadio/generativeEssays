From Turin Turambar ME Department of Utter Misery Subject Re Christian Morality is In article Dan Schaertel writes In article Petri Pihko writes Dan Schaertel wrote I love god just as much as she loves If she wants to seduce me she'll know what to But if He She did you would probably consider it Probably because it IS Simple logic arguments are If you read the Bible you will see that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic Our ability to reason is just a spec of Yet some think it is the If you rely simply on your reason then you will never know more than you do Your argument is of the type you'll know once you try Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that they had lived in a virtual Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do So So It may work for some but not for others it doesn't give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual as well as individually And since Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary or even particularly To learn you must accept that which you don't What does this mean To learn you must accept that you don't know something right But to learn you must accept something I don't know why This is not the way I prefer to It is unwise to merely swallow everything you Suppose I write a book telling how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn tm has helped me in my daily problems would you accept this since you can't know whether it is true or not No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against But let me ask you a Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for that matter anything in I mean it's just what other people have told you and you don't want to swallow what others right Well we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that say there was a military conflict in Vietnam years ago then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain The fact that Jesus warned against it means I warn against it Big The life death and resurection of Christ is documented historical This is not The first two choices here life and death are scantily documented and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible and that is totally Perhaps it be better to use the imagination or one's Someone else will address this I'm sure and refer you to plenty of As much as anything else you How do you choose what to believe and what not to I could argue that George Washington is a He never lived because I don't have any proof except what I am However all the major events of the life of Jesus Christ were fortold hundreds of years before Neat trick uh How is this There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to manipulate interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the coming of Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the What a miscarriage of There is no way to get into a sceptical You can not say you have given a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to You must TRUST not just go to church and participate in it's Were you ever willing to die for what you believed Well since we have skeptical hearts thank goodness there is no way to get into Here we have the irreconcilable difference Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub trust belief faith without If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up then I may associate this as a sign of God it will feel right and I will trust without knowing Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at but rather it seems to be more of a sudden I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed many of us were The question is is suchg an attitude reflective of a correct or healthy IT would seem not to The same thing could reflect fanaticism for example and is any case an expression of simple Adam Adam John Cooper Verily often have I laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because they had no Understand one another I fear I am beyond your Gandalf
