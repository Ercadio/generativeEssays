from aario sami subject re note to bobby m in s n mozumder writes >insults about the atheistic genocide was totally unintentional. under
>atheism, anything can happen, good or bad, including genocide. and you know why this is? because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as
someone who can do no wrong, and you've _defined_ people who do wrong as
atheists. the above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,
as such, has no value.
