From Fred Rice Subject Re Yet more Rushdie Re ISLAMIC LAW In Robert Knowles writes DATE Sat Apr GMT FROM Fred Rice In Jon Livesey writes Should we British go around blowing up skyscrapers next I don't know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying that the person accused of blowing up the WTC in NY actually did it and that Islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the WTC World Trade Centre which was the building that was blown up I to make some The person has only been accused innocent until proven guilty remember Secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that I read For instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly Perhaps Salamen was one of those uneducated Muslims we hear so much Nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated It doesn't seem to fit together Actually Salameh was not the ONLY person The other fellow was a chemical engineer working for Allied Signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not we actually allow radical Muslim types to study things like this in our universities so much for the price of freedom From what I read the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a I assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions over the phone one must need some brains I would Despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and Muslims in the United States as a consequence of his accusation I have now please tell us where this is I live in the and I have heard very little about these mosque There are many mosques in Houston Texas and I would like to know what is going on so I can verify Or is the Great Jewish Media Conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the We heard about the mosque attacks during the Desert Storm venture so why is it so quiet now Maybe it is localized to New Jersey I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times the newspaper weekly of the Australian Muslim If this is true perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America if they see this posting can Islamic teachings teach against harming the In the Qur'an it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of The blowing up of the WTC and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to Islamic This means absolutely Plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious I have seen people post many things here from the Koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated Muslim to allow them to harm idolators and The first thing every Muslim says is that no Muslim could have done that because Islam teaches against harming And we are supposed to take you WORD that it NEVER What do you think is the consequence Does Allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs Of course Muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the We're pretty hip to that And I even doubt that it will come up in the My defense is that I am Muslim and Islam teaches me not to harm the Therefore the people who were killed must not have been Sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir I am a Allah is all Allah would not have allowed Are you insulting my religion Great defense eh Just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent Muslims in the world and stop hiding from that It does no one any good to deny It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the bad Can you see that I don't deny this The thrust of my argument here is that a Salameh is according to US law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of As his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this b Islam teaches us not to harm If Muslims who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this perform such actions it is not because of the teachings of Islam but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of This is an important I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim In general anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Thus one who might do things contrary to Islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu'min which means true believer However whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God and perhaps that person himself So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in because it is not known to anybody except myself and God whether I for example am a true believer or For example I could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here without anyone Thus when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress Islamic By Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu'min or true believer in Fred Rice
