From Jim Perry Subject Re Is Morality Constant was Re Biblical Rape This response originally fell into a bit I'm reposting it just so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring In article Bill Conner writes Jim Perry wrote Some stuff about Biblical morality though Bill's quote of me had little to do with what he goes on to say Bill I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism I think many of these are well addressed in the famous Your generalisms are then misplaced atheism needn't imply materialism or the lack of an absolute moral However I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality so I'll answer your How then can an atheist judge value An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according to a personal understanding of That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have I'm just explicit as in the line of postings you followed up that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me be they Christians Muslims or So when I say that I object to genocide I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does my answer would be mechanistic to your taste that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies thereby achieving considerable survival You'd probably say that God just made the Neither of us can convince the other but we share a common understanding about many moral You think you get it from your religion I think I get it and you get it from early childhood That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites is mechanistic but of course I think that's true of you as My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does but if a god existed who commanded genocide I could not consider him good which is supposedly an attribute of All of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil and cannot Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight Yes I think some heavy FAQ reading would do you some I have as much place discussing values as any other In fact I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by framing the questions in terms of reason for instance it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands then the quality of life will be generally poor so a system that fosters coexistence is superior if quality of life is an agreed An absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with and say this is good even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the The attempt to define someone or a group of people as excluded from discussion such that they cannot participate and their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or reasoning ad hominem poisoning the well and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right wrong and the Jim Perry Decision Support Matthews NC These are my For a nominal fee they can be Jim Perry Decision Support Matthews NC These are my For a nominal fee they can be
