From frank Frank O'Dwyer Subject Re After years can we say that Christian Morality is In article MANDTBACKA Mats Andtbacka writes In frank writes In article MANDTBACKA Mats Andtbacka writes Ah that old chestnut your claim that moral objectivism scientific I don't agree with it now try proving through some objective moral test that my disagreeing is Your claim which you have deleted now was not universal not objective I've deleted it now in the interest of Go back a step and you'll see it was still in your Yes that was my claim if you can refute it then please do Firstly an You hadn't deleted your claim and I was mistaken in saying you Sorry for any offence Secondly how can I refute your definition I can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other Indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all I have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good So what is objective Not the age of the universe anyway as I show How many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent I'd be amazed if it was more than How many different moral systems can different members of society have indeed single individuals in some cases and humanity still stick together Begging the People can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick You are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about Why The age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish This assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesn't depend on what we Why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak I've heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me The same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random I wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed If a moral system makes a prediction It will be better that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction This drug will relieve People's ideas about the age of object X are not objective you can have any idea you like and I can't stop Universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them that's a problem with your opinion of Assume an objective reality and you get statements like I claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and If I'm wrong then some more or less objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence Can you back up your positive claim above That's because it's an I make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the Point Morals are in essence personal Usually ideally well founded motivated such but nonetheless The fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question which can be good for the evolution of a social And if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there is a football on a desk I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two Perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it so Take a look on the desk perform a If football THEN accept theory ELSE DO Tell people they're hallucinating Now take a look at See anything If so please inform me which way to look and WHY to look that particular way as opposed to some Get my drift Just Are you claiming never to know what good means Science is a whole other matter Says Prove that those who disagree are wrong That's a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific I think it's great and should be applied to I may be completely wrong but that's what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of Frank O'Dwyer 'I'm not hatching That' from Hens by Evelyn Conlon
