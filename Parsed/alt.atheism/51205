but don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children. i would add the
well-funded group tries also to purge science, to deny children access to great
wonders and skills. and how about the kids born to creationists? what a
burden with which to begin adult life. it must be a cruel awakening for those
who finally see the light, provided it is possible to escape from the depths of
this type of ignorance.
