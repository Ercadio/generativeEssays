From Kevin Anthoney Subject Re Consciousness part II Kev Strikes Back In article Petri Pihko writes Kevin Anthoney wrote This post is probably either brilliant or Do let me know A brilliant example of using the introspective objection against materialist theories of Diplomatic I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument so I'll try to explain why I feel a mind is Firstly I'm not impressed with the ability of They're great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not at working out the method As a specific example I like to solve numerical crosswords not the simple do the sums and insert the answers type the hard To do these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of Now I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles but in doing so you have to work out the tricks yourself and program them into the You can of course 'obfuscate' the trick and write the program so that it is uncovered but as far as I can see the trick still has to be there in some form to be Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre programmed into our brains This is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn't One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation but again as far as I can see this still has an air of 'if you see object X then perform action Y ' and we don't seem to get The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see and what conclusions to draw from it's The other problem with algorithms is their Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are side effects but patients still seem remarkably Also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's code The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour replace 'colour' with the sensation of your Presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of chemical The usual products of such a reaction are energy different Is colour a mixture of these If this is so a computer won't see colour because the chemistry is Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn't It shouldn't because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent So why do we see colour However such a view is actually a How should minds be able to act as observers feel pain and pleasure and issue commands any better than the brain Moreover how do the interactions occur A bit of idle If I remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on The first process has been called 'Unitary Evolution' or 'U' is governed by Schroedinger's equation and is well The second process called various things such as 'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' or 'R' and is more It is usually said to occur when a 'measurement' takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that When it does occur the effect of R is to abruptly change the I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else ' which I shall imaginitively call 'part ' It seems reasonable to assume that something causes R although that something might be the wavefunction itself in which case part X is simply the Note though that we'd need more than U to explain Anyway I'm speculating that minds would be in part There seems to be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X but since this is only speculation that won't matter too much My main point is that there might be a place for minds in I'll go back to my nice padded cell now if that's OK with you Petri Kevin Anthoney Don't believe anything you read in
