From Andrew Newell TAN Subject Re free moral agency In article Bill Conner says wrote Now what I am interested in is the original notion you were discussing on moral free That is how can a god punish a person for not believing in him when that person is only following his or her nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god I think you're letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of WEBSTER myth a traditional or legendary truth is accepted How does that qualify Indeed it's almost rather amusing I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don't meet the other Divine According to the most fundamental doctrines of Christianity When the first man sinned he was at that time the You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian This time meeting all the requirements of The idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively that God exists is their creator and Ah but not everyone knows that god So you have a There's nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably Biblically literate The only controversy is And that makes it true Holding with the Bible rules out controversy Read the If you've read it you missed something so re Not a bad suggestion for re read it just before with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it When atheists claim that they do not know if God exists and don't know what He wants they contradict the Bible which clearly says that everyone The authority of the Bible is its claim to be I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to If the Bible says that everyone knows that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged god's alleged refuted while the species wide condemnation is Those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible the ignorance itself is no No they don't have to ignore the The Bible is far from universally The Bible is NOT a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a Or does it prove even that They might have been writing it as series of fiction short As in the case of Assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical philosophers were There are people who have truly never heard of the Again read the You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only answer Gravity is directly It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore God on the other hand doesn't generally show up in the supermarket except on the God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable Gravity is obvious gods aren' Secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our Human reason always comes back to the question of God in every generation and in No human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of God it has usually come back to the existance of god In other words it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any And in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out From a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in A natural tendancy to believe in God only exists in religious wishful I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently reasonable that Divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it Whether you agree or not Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit Divine it only seems just to those who already believe in the First not all atheists believe the same things about human Second whether most atheists are correct or not YOU certainly are not correct on human You are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric Try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of Andrew
