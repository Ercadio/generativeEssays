From James Felder Subject Re some In article DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes First I want to start right out and say that I'm a It makes sense to be Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book liar lunatic or the real thing I might be a little off on the title but he writes the Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity in the process he became a Christian Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some Just what organization did he belong to Does it have a name The book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day Koresh or he was actually who he said he Logic alert artificial The are many other possible Could have been that he never There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as Who would die for a lie Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar People gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been Call me a fool but I believe he did heal Logic alert argument from Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he As far as healing If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal Niether was he a Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was Very doubtful in fact For example anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real Or might not have existed or any number of That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall There are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible However if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original I have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer Some other things to He fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in hrs This in his betrayal and I don't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use JC was a He knew what those prophecies It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then yet fullfilled them I don't think most people understand what a Christian It is certainly not what I see a lot in Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere But just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a We box everything into time Such as work at this time sports Tv social God is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for Here I agree with Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of I have very little respect for Xians that don' If the myth is true then it is true in its The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my Jim James Felder Sverdrup Technology phone NASA Lewis Research Center Cleveland Ohio email Some people drink from the fountain of knowledge other people gargle
