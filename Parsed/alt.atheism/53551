From Subject Re Death Penalty Gulf War long Shamim Zvonko Mohamed wrote BULLSHIT In the Gulf Massacre of all ordnance used was The rest that's was just regular dumb ol' iron bombs and Have you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage Or that a successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud passed each other in the same area of the sky And of the that was the smart stuff Again try to follow me here that means of this smart arsenal I used to have full figures on this including the tons of bombs dropped and the number of cluster bomblet munitions I had heard the of the laser guided weapons hit which is an unprecedented rate of of the iron weapons hit again The following is a rough estimate but this means of the tons of bombs dropped by US aircraft around tons missed I'm not sure what proportion of this was dropped of Baghdad rather than troop concentrations in Iraq and Much of the tonnage dropped was cluster munitions as were all the MRLS rounds and many of the artillery Napalm and fuel air explosives were also used Remember how we were told that weapons of mass destruction such as FAE were very naughty indeed
