From mathew Subject Re Death Penalty Gulf War long writes I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent But I do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the suffering caused by those I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill Don't worry though as a Loving Christian I guarantee that I will regret the fact that I have to kill you although I won't regret the actual If we hadn't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have been But did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action Or are you just setting up a strawman I'm not setting up a strawman at If you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep False Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were That's because they weren't even But what about those who didn't support Hitler's dreams of conquest It's not as if they democratically voted for all his The NSDAP got in the elections of and that was the last chance the German people got to vote on the They suffered along with the Why does this bother you so much You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary The world is full of evil and circumstances are not Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of It it regretable but that's The Way It And why is it that way Who set things up to be that way this was happening before the Gulf Why didn't we send in the bombers to East Timor Why aren't we sending in the bombers NOW Probably because we're not the saviors of the We can't police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade No just the ones that have Or the ones that look like they might make a success of Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other I don't see that getting UN forces to East Timor is any harder than getting them to Tibetan people are rounded up tortured and Amnesty International recently reported that torture is still widespread in Why aren't we stopping them In fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support I for one do not agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put I agree that it is Write to your Congressman and to President China's status as Most Favoured Nation comes up for renewal in Point out that the US shouldn't be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable I doubt anything will Clinton's keener on trade sanctions against Unbelievable comments about the Rodney King case deleted The media is not totally Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the MacNeil Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to Hurrah for Rush Any idea how many kill files you just ended up in I an atheist am arguing against killing innocent You a supposed Christian are arguing that it's OK to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as I didn't say that it's a Good Thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect If one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and I didn't say it is OK it is unfortunate but sometimes The ends justify the means eh You having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that I am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral The same tired old Moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of It doesn't mean you can't judge other people's Christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head Where's your Christian love Where's your absolute morality Oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits As Ivan Stang would say Jesus would puke One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this I understand the full ramifications of that and I am prepared to do I don't believe that you can make the same Obviously not as I am an I don't think you'd get on with Jesus though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik was he not And BTW the reason I brought up the blanket bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that But in the Gulf War precision bombing was the So the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in Unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next As I understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German civilians But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history Oh come With wars like the Falklands fresh in people's minds that sort of propaganda isn't going to fool The stories of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain Yes The US lost servicemen in over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting Yes And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered It's hardly surprising the US didn't lose many men in given that you turned up mathew
