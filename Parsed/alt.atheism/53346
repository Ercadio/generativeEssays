From Gregg Jaeger Subject Re Yet more Rushdie Re ISLAMIC LAW In article C r C B unix portal com Dan E Babcock writes In article C qt p M Ken Arromdee writes In article Gregg Jaeger writes I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view as I've articulated it above which may not be the true view of Khomeini is from the basic principles of Islam From the point ov view of an atheist, I see you claim Khomeini wasn't practicing true Islam But I'm sure that he would have said the same about you How am I, a member of neither group, supposed to be able to tell which one of you two is really a true Muslim Easy just read the Koran Because the Koran is perfect, there is no possibility of disagreement Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind it Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is presumably some sort of reasoning behind it As an argument, this statement is worthless Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious text whatever that might be there is still plenty of room for disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact do disagree about Islam, which doesn't presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of Islam This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have disagreements about all issues relevant to Islam Gregg
