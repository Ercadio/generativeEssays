From Rashid Subject Re Yet more Rushdie Re ISLAMIC LAW In article Fred Rice wrote It is my understanding that it is generally agreed upon by the ulema Islamic scholars that Islamic law applies only in an Islamic country of which the UK is Furthermore to take the law into one's own hands is a criminal act as these are matters for the state not for Nevertheless Khomeini offered a cash prize for people to take the law into their own hands something which to my understanding is against Islamic Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law sunni and jaffari can be levelled against muslim or non muslims both within and outside dar al I do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to Islam falls into this category of the I do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Stuff deleted Also I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the distribution of the My understanding is that Khomeini's fatwa was issued in response to the writing and publishing of the If my view is correct then your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the However the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the Rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred It was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as The crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of shatim also applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad
