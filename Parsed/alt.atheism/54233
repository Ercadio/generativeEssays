From Petri Pihko Subject Re Christian Morality is Dan Schaertel wrote In article Petri Pihko writes I love god just as much as she loves If she wants to seduce me she'll know what to But if He She did you would probably consider it Of course I would think that would be great fun not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing This is not what I got when I believed I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for God did not In the end I found I had been following a mass delusion a I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do So I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their In fact it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite one should not examine one's belief I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this group two months A day after I finally found out my faith is over I decided to try just one more The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of I told my friend in a phone that it really works thank god just to think about it again when I hung I had to admit that I had lied and fallen prey to the same No one asks you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warns against But let me ask you a Do you beleive what you learn in history class or for that matter anything in I mean it's just what other people have told you and you don't want to swallow what others right I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger or what other people told me but I grew more and more skeptical the more I I learned what it means to use reason As a student of chemistry I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the I hated experiments like this they are old fashioned and increase the student's workload Besides I had to do it twice since I failed in my first However I think I'll never forget the lesson No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X it may still be It is very tempting to jump into conclusions take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is But it can still be I found out that I was after all using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self assurance suspension of fear filtering of In other words it was only me no god playing any The life death and resurection of Christ is documented historical Oh And I had better believe this Dan many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave Besides the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance the end of Mark is missing from many early texts says my Jesus may have lived and died but he was probably As much as anything else you How do you choose what to believe and what not to This is I believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I Nothing else need to be taken on faith I will go by the It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or I assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence There is no way to get into a sceptical You can not say you have given a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to You must TRUST not just go to church and participate in it's Were you ever willing to die for what you believed A liar how do you know what my attitude was Try reading your Bible I was willing to die for my Those who do are usually remembered as heroes at least among those who Dan do you think I'm lying when I say I believed firmly for years It seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so But I can't go on lying to Blind trust is dangerous and I was just another blind led by the But if god really wants me she'll know what to I'm I just don't know whether she exists looking at the available evidence it looks like she doesn' Petri ' '' Petri Pihko kem pmp Mathematics is the ' ' ' ' ' Pihatie C Physics is the Rule of ' ' ' SF OULU kempmp the ' FINLAND Chemistry is The
