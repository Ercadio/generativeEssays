From frank Frank O'Dwyer Subject Re Theism and Fanatism was Islamic Genocide In article I Benedikt Rosenau writes In article frank Frank O'Dwyer writes Theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in Irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with deletion Theism is correlated with I have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to The point is theism increases the chance of becoming a One could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but I just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be I just said that theism is not the only factor for The point is that theism is a That's your claim now back it I consider your argument as useful as the following Belief is strongly correlated with Therefore belief is a factor in True and utterly Note this is any belief not belief in Gods Gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable And the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these They are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are That's a claim you have to Please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they If you believe that you're incredibly Now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism I grant To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious Ever read Animal Farm That's a straw And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it Read what I have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by The point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of No some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some Your last statement simply isn't implied by what you say before because you're trying to sneak in innate features of all theism The word you're groping for is some Gullibility by the way is one of No shit So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw Interesting that you have nothing better to I said it reads like a warm up to That's because it's an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice Them Us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church Define irrational belief is it rational to believe that reason is always useful Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon The latter has been discussed for a long time with Charley One point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable Well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be Which is it That's Self reference is not And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is it's It's still begging the question And though that certainly is allowed it's not And you claiming to be rational and At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn't hear a refutation before so we're Deal with it you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is Someone who thinks reason is crap won't buy it you Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore Anybody else think Godel was silly The first part of the second statement contains no information because you don't say what the beliefs If the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general The second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually I exist is derived if you want it that Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of what is it you are trying to say That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at Example I am not dreaming Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but I can't agree with this until you are specific which theism To say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which I suspect you do not Using the traditonal definition of Personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this Usually connected to morals and or the way the world IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily That does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of Some atheists are also scientists for The affinity to fanatism is easily It has to be true because I believe it is nothing more than a work However the beliefs say they are more than a work I don't understand Can you formalise your argument Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so That does not make B true it is at best a work However the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B already believed says it is wronG a waste of time not Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites Idolaters Protestants are to be killed this can have interesting Peculiar definition of interesting but Now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you Why aren't my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example Maybe they don't believe in Maybe it's the conjunction of B asserts B and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely It certainly seems so to me but then I have no axe to grind Frank O'Dwyer 'I'm not hatching That' from Hens by Evelyn Conlon
