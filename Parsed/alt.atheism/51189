from heikki t suopanki subject re a visit from the jehovah's witnesses on apr 11:24:30 mst, said: :> god is eternal. [a = b]
:> jesus is god. [c = a]
:> therefore, jesus is eternal. [c = b] :> this works both logically and mathematically. god is of the set of
:> things which are eternal. jesus is a subset of god. therefore
:> jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal. everything isn't always so logical.... mercedes is a car.
that girl is mercedes.
therefore, that girl is a car? -heikki
