From I Benedikt Rosenau Subject Re A visit from the Jehovah's Witnesses In article writes Didn't you say Lucifer was created with a perfect nature Define perfect I think you are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni holy or perfect and don't note that they mean exactly what they And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to I'm not trying to play games But I understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as Take your foot out of your mouth I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an Believe me I believed similar sentences for a long But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its Now God could have prevented Lucifer's fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives worship God or worship himself but that would mean that God was in error to have make Lucifer or any being with free will in the first God allows evil an evil if there ever was Now that's an opinion or at best a But from my point of view it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is an evil to allow evil to It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another But could you give a definition of free will Especially in the presence of an omniscient being Will is self determination In other words God created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of All will therefore is free will The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created There is no choice All is known the course of events is Not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by James If God is omniscient then clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than the emergence of ungodliness evil sin since He created them knowing the outcome in Why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it will happen Why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply doing It is logically possible but your god has not done I do not know that such is logically If God restrains a free being's choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice And if good is defined as loving and obeying God and avoiding those behaviors which God prohibits then how can you say that one who is not good is not evil as well Like I said I am not sure that doing not good without doing evil is logically And when I am not omnipotent how can I have free will You have said something about choices and the scenario gives Therefore we have what you define as free Imagine the I can do good to other beings but I cannot harm Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don't make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as But whose case am I arguing It is conceivable so the omnipotent can do Or it would not be If you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent Deletion Perhaps it is weak in a If I were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such But this idea of God didn't just fall on me out of the blue or while reading science fiction or I know that some will disagree The Bible describes a God who is omniscient and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which the definitional logic But that's not all there is to There seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicates that God exists and that the Biblical description of Him may be a fair It is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately there can't be any with these Benedikt
