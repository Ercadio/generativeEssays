From frank Frank O'Dwyer Subject Re After years can we say that Christian Morality is In article David Nye writes reply to frank Frank O'Dwyer The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the This can be avoided in at least two ways By leaving the Good undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a If the Good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to No and begging the see By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative Ditto An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making Again incorrect and question See At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self evident truths' Pretty perceptive that but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder Of course by denying that subject object is true Please explain how this I don't see your I don't see It seems to rest on the assertion that everything is either a subject or an There's nothing compelling about that I might just as well divide the world into subject object It even seems more Causation for example is an event not a subject or an Furthermore if subject object were true dichotomy Everything is either a subject or an object Then is that statement a self evident truth or not If so then it's all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of categories subject object event which can be reduced to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why yes I guess I am denying that self evident truths are all in the mind of the If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true All of If nothing then NO moral judgements are This is a thing that is commonly referred to as It entails that science is of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it How anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats This makes no sense Flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the Furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the I'm referring to ethical nihilism The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate To hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human And if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion is not Likewise if the preferences should include noTerrorism that moral opinion is not Why should one choose a set of preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes noTerrorism Oh no This is patently And also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by Ditch the strawman already and see my reply to Mike Cobb's root message in the thread Societal Basis for I've responded over BTW I don't intend this as a strawman but as something logically entailed by relativism really any ethical system where values are assumed to be unreal It's different to say Relativists than relativism Frank O'Dwyer 'I'm not hatching That' from Hens by Evelyn Conlon
