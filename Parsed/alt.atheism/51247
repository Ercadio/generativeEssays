From Lucio de Re Subject Re atheist Tony Lezard writes My opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much belief for me to be comfortable Any strong atheists out there care to comment As far as I can tell strong atheists are far outnumbered on by weak At the cost of repudiating the FAQ I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists believe in the non existence of god I think the separation is a valid To cover my arse what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism I wish Whereas I logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect I am a strong atheist and wish I could be a mathematical one To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is If I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been found to be To me this is adequate evidence that the real god is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable I'm a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject Lucio de Re lucio tab stops at
