From Atherton Subject Serial Printing Hi We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer dmp or Laser I have used Works and Windows The output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output but anything fancy garbles or just doesn't The exception is outputting to a Lserjet which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data not to bother about handshaking I'm sure I'm not alone in I've tried most of the Print Network manager options I can think Anyone had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it Thanks John Atherton
