From EDU Costas Malamas Subject Re Windows vs Communication Proagrams In article lee SEAS UCLA EDU Victor Friedman writes Can anybody tell me what exactly Windows does to the COM ports Why can't I run a single communication program under Windows I have ProComm , QuickLink, COMMO neither of them respond to modem commands after the connection has finally been established, although I'm still able to manage Vick This is one of the trickiest problems w Win Personally I run Telix for DOS under Windows just fine and 've been waiting for the Win version froever , but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of them w big problems Some of the stuff you have to lookout for ALWAYS run the prog thru a PIF, never by calling its exe, In the PIF always toggle on lock application memory actually this is something MS points out in the readme wri file, and is especially critical for downloading Go under Ctrl Panel enh and check for all your COM ports 'Alway Warn' it will help u w debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' Check where are u running the mouse from com port check the com port addresses from your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel Ports Setup Advanced These might help u If yu still have problems, get and buy Procomm Win , Hope it helps somehow Costas Malamas Georgia Institute of Technology OIT UA OIT doesn't pay me enough to share their opinions Internet
