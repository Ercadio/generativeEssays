From Gilles KHOUZAM Subject Re Workgroup Questions conven ram and licensing In article Ny rA AB writes I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few questions about Windows for Workgroups I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver I am considering moving all our machines to W WG Q How much conventional ram does W WG use over and above the driver for the network card I have just checked it and you have three files that are loaded PROTMAN Bytes DRIVER Bytes WORKGRP Bytes Q If I have a Novell NE card, are the LSL and IPX drivers still needed No W WG uses it's own drivers Q Does W WG do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of W WG Note I do not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy of W WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies Not that I know of, I bought two copies, had some problems with one installed both from the same copie, no problems Do worry I just had a really old BIOS and that's the only problem I got Q If you buy the upgrade to Windows for W WG does it replace all of Win as you install it or does it depend on current Win files It will replace all older files I think and prompt you for the others Q If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have any troubles with the W WG machines This I do not know When I started this message, I was going to ask only questions but I got carried away I'll stop now I look forward to your replies Al Hope this helps GEL
