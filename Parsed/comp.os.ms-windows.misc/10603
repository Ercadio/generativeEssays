From Chih Keng Chen Subject COntrol SYstems analysis PAcKage COSY PAK v updated for Mathematica Announcing COSY PAK A symbolic COntrol SYstems analysis PAcKage Version NO USER FEE RELEASE for Mathematica Version or higher INTRODUCTION COSY PAK is set of packages and notebooks for classical control and some modern state space control analysis and design methods The notebooks in COSY PAK follow a typical Control Engineering I' course taught at many universities around the world for the junior senior level undergraduates There is NO FEE to use COSY PAK but certain responsibilities are expected of the user see Copyright notice in the README file included below For starters e mail FAX Mail Post the registration form included in the README file COSY PAK is available via anonymous ftp' from mishna esys cwru edu INTERNET No in the pub directory P S A typical ftp session in UNIX is given after the README file FUTURE RELEASES If you would like to receive updates and newer versions of COSY PAK please send e mail FAX mail to the address below In addition, your comments and suggestions are appreciated and are invaluable to us We will do our best to fix any reported bugs However, we cannot fix those bugs that have not been reported to us and those we do not know of We would very much appreciate you taking a few minutes to communicate to us via e mail US Mail Telephone FAX This will help us to release bug free versions in the future Comments are welcome N Sreenath Systems Engineering Department Case School of Engineering Case Western Reserve University e mail U S Mail Prof N

Case Western Reserve University is gratefully acknowledged Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech for all the help FTP COSY PAK is available by anonymous ftp' from mishna esys cwru edu Internet No A sample ftp session is given at the end of this file Changes in Version update from v to v In this version, we have revised COSY PAK to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v Since Mathematica provides a better and working LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than Mathematica v did, we adopted them This has made COSY PAK smaller Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported the LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the COSY PAK v are no longer needed directly by COSY PAK v For power users who use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very fine Brian Evans package on Signal Processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss eedsp gatech edu or IP On the downside, the disadvantage of this update can be that Mathematica requires more runtime resources than its previous version For Mathematica users We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica in the directory For ' Please move all files and directory under For into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory Introduction This is an unsupported release of COSY PAK a COntrol SYstems analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using Mathematica Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a NeXT TM computer a UNIX based workstation They have been used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control engineering texts Ogata , Phillips and Harbor for undergraduate courses in Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems Engineering Department of CWRU In addition to the NeXT, they have also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers TM , and, IBM PC's TM running MS Windows TM We would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above IBM users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics Once installed see below for instructions , this collection of Mathematica packages can be loaded by any user Bundled with the packages are many notebooks COSY Notes which demonstrate the functionality of these packages The notebooks follow a plan of many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books listed in the references Examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the various references given at the end of this file The contents of the notebooks in the COSY Notes directory are given below Begin COSY Notes Contents NOTEBOOK FILE NAME Introduction ma CHAPTER Introduction to Control Systems Sections Analyticity Poles

higher COSY PAK IBM zip zip file for the IBM PC running MS DOS Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on Macintosh IBM PC Unix systems also Installation of COSY PAK o In UNIX Command line type the following command zcat COSY PAK tar Z tar xvf o In Macintosh open the sit hqx file using the shareware Stuffit v or higher o In IBM Command line type the following command pkunzip o d COSY PAK IBM zip NOTE This zip file was zipped by zip utility v You must use pkunzip version or higher to unzip it IBM PC's may limit the directory name characters to eight In that event type pkunzip o d COSY PAK zip You can also unzip the COSY PAK IBM zip file on any Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it Uncompressing and untarring COSY PAK tar Z or unzipping COSY PAK IBM zip will create a directory called COSY PAK Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory COSY PAK containing the following three files, four sub directories and their contents SUB DIRECTORIES in COSY

recognize LocalLibrary Mathematica Packages on a UNIX machine, MY HardDisk Mathematica Packages on an Apple Macintosh, c winmath packages on an IBM PC At the beginning of the Initialization cell of each notebook in COSY Notes directory, we list the example about how to make Mathematica identify the directory Initialization of Path Example For a UNIX machine Default Path Join Path, LocalLibrary Mathematica Packages Example For an Apple Macintosh Path Join Path, MY HardDisk Mathematica Packages Example For IBM PC Path Join Path, c winmath packages Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the Mathematica comment sign ' and ' before and after Path' setting This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory LocalLibrary Mathematica Packages on a UNIX machine MY HardDisk Mathematica Packages on a Apple Macintosh c winmath packages on an IBM PC Mathematica users We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica in the directory For Please move all files and directory under For into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory Getting started After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in the COSY Notes directory All notebooks load their own packages Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy IBM users however will have to evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics USER RESPONSIBILITIES We request you to take a few
