From robert k nichols Subject Re moving icons In article bp rAHPBh h viamar UUCP rutgers viamar kmembry writes I remember reading about a program that made windows icons run away from the mouse as it moved near them Does anyone know the name of this program and the ftp location probably at cica There's a program called Icon Frightener included with the book Stupid Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel Addison Wesley, It's freeware If it's not on the net anywhere, I'll happily email a copy to someone who's willing to upload it I can't upload through our Internet firewall Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
