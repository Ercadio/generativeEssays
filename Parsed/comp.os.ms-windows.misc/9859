From nd edu Subject Re Canon BJ BubbleJet and HP DeskJet In article Apr CSD NewsHost Stanford EDU kayman csd d Stanford EDU Robert Kayman writes From kayman csd d Stanford EDU Robert Kayman Subject Canon BJ BubbleJet and HP DeskJet Keywords printer Date Apr GMT Hello fellow 'netters I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I should purchase, the Canon BJ BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet I thought, rather than trust the salesperson, I would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the Hewlett Packard DeskJet dpi Which is faster Is there a noticeable print quality difference, particularly in graphics Which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here Which works better under Windows any driver problems, etc Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc Basically, your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable, both good and bad Advance kudos and thanks for all your input E mail or news posting is readily acceptable, but e mail is encouraged limits bandwidth Sincerely, Robert Kayman or In theory, theory and practice are the same In practice, they are not You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision revised All right Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give your question a shot The key issue that I bought my BJ on was ink drying speed You really have to try awful hard to get the BJ ink to smear The HP DeskJets need seconds to completely dry In both cases, however, do not get your pages wet Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not toner But that should go without saying My PC has very little memory only Meg RAM , so the BJ takes a little while to print but every application I use takes a while to run Once the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out every seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are The BJ can do Windows soft fonts I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or HP wouldn't sell many Size is another factor The BJ is much smaller, but the HP is built like a tank I bet the BJ would get damaged first Finally, the print quality I LOVE the BJ 's resolution It looks like a good laser quality print The HP's I've used they look like ink Not as impressive So, I chose the Canon Any other opinions
