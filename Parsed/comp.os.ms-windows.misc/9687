From Daniel M Coleman Subject Re MathCad swap file In article A , Gregg Walters writes I have MB of memory on my SX I have been running Windows without a swap file for several months Will Mathcad be happy with this, or insist on a swap file I just got Mathcad , and the manual is not clear on the matter On page At least megabytes of memory All memory about K should be configured as XMS At least megabytes of virtual memory Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it but the new Mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common sense Dan Daniel Matthew Coleman Internet The University of Texas at Austin DECnet UTXVMS DCOLEMAN Electrical Computer Engineering BITNET DCOLEMAN UTXVMS BITNET
