From Seagull Subject Re WP PCF Linux RISC The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC It is true that there are fewer instructions but what is not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell so that in some cases performance is similar for larger As a compromise many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set and a Complex This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors Intel has certainly proved What I want to know is what does this have to do with this group dave Subject Re WP PCF Linux RISC Newsgroups under unix References From article by In article ghhwang writes Dear friend The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is Some people say it's fun but I think it's very Dave Siegel President RTD Systems and Networking President UofAz Hardware And Computing Knowledge Society HACKS
