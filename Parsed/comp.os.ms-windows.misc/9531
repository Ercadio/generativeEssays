From Bret Mogilefsky Subject Re Any good sound formats conversion program out there In article Li writes Hi all Does anyone know if there is a good sound formats conversion program out there Like PaintshopPro for picture formats conversion Please send me a copy of your reply thanks a lot Bel THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool which is shareware from I found a copy somewhere in a long time ago but I don't know offhand what directory it was It's GREAT at converting files of all types including Mac NExT Sun and various PC It's also a great player and editor with various special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to It requires a driver for various sound The only builtin one is for the pc speaker and even that sounds pretty good but if you're just using it to convert things you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound Give it a try Bret Why that's the second biggest monkey head I've ever seen Guybrush
