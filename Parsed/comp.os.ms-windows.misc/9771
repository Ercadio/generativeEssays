From robert k nichols Subject Re ATM In article r jq Anthony V Dean writes I've been reading, with much confusion, about whether or not to use ATManager Lately, all the packages I've been buying have all included ATManager as a bonus I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over diff types Add that to the TTfonts that come with win and you have a decent amount of fonts I print my creations out on an HP Postcript, at dpi resolution with the Resolution Enhancement Technology and well I get some darn good copies So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these better printer technologies and TT ATM will do nothing for your TrueType fonts If your TrueType fonts are sufficient for your needs, don't run ATM I have a lot of fonts that I can install either as Type PostScript under ATM or as TrueType I have noticed that TrueType font files are at least larger than their Type equivalents If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type fonts will not they are encrypted With a dpi laser printer, the artificial bold version of a TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to install the actual bold and bold italic, etc variants if I want to use them Type PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually distinct bold variant from the base font I realize that the artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior to the hand generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me on disk space uncompressed Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
