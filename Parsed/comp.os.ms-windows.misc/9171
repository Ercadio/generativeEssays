From nagel Kurt Nagel Subject Re AMI Pro and equation mode nagel Kurt Nagel writes Hi I'm having a problem with AMIPro when writing If the equation extends past a certain point on a line the whole thing If I then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation AMI goes The line counter at the bottom of the screen increments repeatedly and the only way out is to CTRL ATL If I have been unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up equations the document is basically although I have been able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large chunks of the document Has anyone else experienced this Does Lotus know about it and or have a patch Thanks in advance Kurt I contacted Lotus about this problem It has been reported previously and there is a Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame or use set frame where placed w no text wrap around Unforutnately once the page run on has occured you are So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this Kurt
