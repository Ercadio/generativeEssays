From Jan van Loenen Subject Re Diamond SS X, Win , Mouse cursor Don A B Lindbergh writes In article A Don A B Lindbergh writes Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond x x driver Sorry, don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently delivered Gateway system Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered if anyone else had seen this As a followup, this is a co worker's machine He has the latest drivers It only happens using the x x driver Sometimes it takes a minute or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode I susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants I excluded a c ff in the EMM line and in system ini The problem persisted Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components It is a mhz DX Eisa bus with an Ultrastore xx controller Ah well, I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it before Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order, but I do find folks here usually are far more in the know I have had several problems with the card Applications crashed when moving the mouse VGA mode Fixed by removing the line STACKS , from config sys The default value STACKS , does just fine Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a color graphical mode the hardware cursor modes Fixed by turning off the hardware scroll xmode scrolloff before entering the graphics mode This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the window The screensavers do not remove the cursor in color modes hardware cursor I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions a remove for draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove unconditionally Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem The VESA driver does not support the x x M TrueColor mode Universal VESA drivers do not run at all DISCLAIMER Unless otherwise stated, the above comments are entirely my own Jan van Loenen Digital Equipment Corporation HLDE LOENEN J
