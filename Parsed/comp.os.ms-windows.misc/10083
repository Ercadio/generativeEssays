From Wayne Long Subject Observation Floppy copy works under PGM MGR, but not DOS shell Has anyone observed this If I copy a large, say K file a large PKZIP file for instance to my floppy drive under MS Windows via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not The corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t b file zip after both copies The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption Now here's the kicker I have many windows open while doing this both DOS and WINDOWs apps Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden So, as an example, I have WINDOWs' apps open, multitasking DOS sessions running, and one execution execlusive DOS shell iconized inactive Under this scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive Thus PGM MGR gets, say, of the Windows slice and of the execution background DOS shell's slices Thus it gets or of the total available CPU time When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute exclusive mode DOS shell no other DOS background tasks allowed , full screen, under the Windows task manager The CPU time available to this shell would be of the Windows slice assumming inactive Windows applications and of the DOS slice or of the total available CPU time So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time Is program manager working in a pre emptive mode during the floppy copy It must be Miscellaneous data Running Windows on top of DOS , qemm x, rapidbios sys, mbyte smartdrive no delayed writes , two ramdrives, logitech mouse driver , full mbytes motherboard RAM, Kbyte motherboard cache, DX Mhz Running dos edit com TSR in the DOS shell Wayne Long OE Internet William Cannon Drive West UUCP cs texas edu oakhill risc wcl Austin, Texas Phone FAX
