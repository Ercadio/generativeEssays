From ak cleveland Freenet Edu Martin Linsenbigler Subject Re EMM EXE and Windows and Dos In a previous article, Rudi Maelbrancke says In Windows I created a permanent Swap file of Kb as win recommended me to do that bit access If I use EMM EXE, after win startup I have K of memory free, if I leave EMM EXE out of my config sys I have K of memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of K I think you need the EMM EXE noems This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the bases covered I use DOS , with memmaker, have MB of internal Memory and a DX, I do not use dos so I am not familiar with this Does anybody knows why this is happening possibly win needs some UMB's to manage virtual memory , If true, which UMB's, those that EMM can find without including suspicious parts I need an optimized DOS environment, because i develop applications for DOS using a windows programming environment Rudi c ya artin This communication is sent by artin University of Arizona Tucson mlinsenb arizvms DEATH HAS BEEN DEAD FOR ABOUT , YEARS FOLLOW THE KING OF KINGS
