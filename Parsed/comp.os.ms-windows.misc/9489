from peter goudswaard subject what is regload exe perusing through my windows directory, i came across a file called regload exe i assume this is part of the registration
database, but neither my windows manual, win resource kit, nor
pc mag's description of files in the windows directory had a
reference to it. at least not one that i could find. does
regedit.exe use it? or am i way off base? -- peter goudswaard _________ _________ (preferred) | | __/^\__ | | | | \ / | | | | _/\_\ /_/\_ | | |         |   >           <   |         |
