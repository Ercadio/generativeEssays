From dbarker Deryk Barker Subject Re WP PCF Linux RISC LEE BRIAN writes In article writes In article ghhwang writes Dear friend The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is The original RISCs had small instruction sets and simple The idea was that a every instruction should be completable in a single clock cycle and b to have no microcode and c extensive A few comparisons from Patterson Reduced Instruction set CACM CPU Year Instructions Microcode IBM DEC VAX IBM UCB RISC Stanford MIPS While researching for the VLSI VAX DEC discovered that of the VAX microcode is there to support of the instruction set which accounted for a mere of all instructions The uVAX subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software emulator for these very complex instructions the full VLSI uVAX included the entire instruction set was times more copmlex but only ranm CPU Chips Microcode Transistors uVAX VLSI uVAX Real Deryk Barker Computer Science Camosun College Victoria Email Phone
