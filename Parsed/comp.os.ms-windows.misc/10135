From Scott Reimert Subject Re Windows NT Should I Upgrade In article Steve Warner writes Hi I am thinking of upgrading to the Beta Version of Windows NT on a Hard Can someone please give me there opion on such a setup for running NT and is the Operating System likely to be better than Windows or Unix' Steve I've been using Windows NT tm since the October release and I have to say that the March release is really a big Windows NT tm is becomming There are a few things to consider before you make the leap First for me at least is that you cannot get a full speed DOS What I mean is I cannot for instance run Falcon or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS It absolutley And my machine is a with a HD and If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box or full screen for that matter please let me The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for For instance my PAS has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster which is natively supported nice because MediaVision hasn't produced drivers Your disk should be large enough to keep an DOS partition and give the rest over to Windows NT tm The only thing is whenever you wanted to run Windows programs you'd have to reboot and log into Windows NT tm instead of just typing Windows NT tm does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows It'd be a good choice if you have the You should really have at LEAST RAM One last thing modems work well enough but I have yet to get my FAX card to work and I've never heard of anyone else who did It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box whereas with UNIX there isn't the same I guess it comes down to Windows NT tm is not yet for the faint of heart it's still a But it's a very GOOD Scott Reimert Standard disclaimer Redondo Beach CA Blah blah blah Always store beer in a cool dark place
