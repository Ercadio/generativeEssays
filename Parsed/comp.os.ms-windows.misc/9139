From Lamont Downs Subject Re Windows There's one thing about Windows that really frosts I have of RAM installed in my I use a under Windows disk cache and a permanent swap While I can never fill the memory up I still have problems sometimes because I run out of GDI What gives I think Windows could manage these resources a little Are you using Windows or If you're still on devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less If you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with the Windows Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal graphics brush in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory Also some don't give it back when they're finished Lamont Downs
