From Richard Krehbiel Subject Re WP PCF, Linux, RISC In article C o yq M ghhwang writes Dear friend, The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about RISC RISC used to mean Reduced Instruction Set Computer , true They still use the same acronym, but only to be familiar What RISC really means is a recently designed CPU In general, most RISC CPUs are like this A large number or more of general purpose registers A fixed instruction size, usually bits An instruction may make only one memory reference Memory references must be aligned There are delayed branches branch after the next instruction or a target prediction bit probably will won't branch Instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction stream Richard Krehbiel OS will do for me until AmigaDOS for the comes along
