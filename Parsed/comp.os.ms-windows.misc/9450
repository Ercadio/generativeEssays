From James Dean Barwick Subject Re Permanaent Swap File with DOS dbldisk In you write While reading through the DOS book it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed To make things compatable I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the However when all the dust settled and I go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the Windows My question is How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesn't you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one but here is my best But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off The permenant swap file is read written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that Windows creates a file called in your windows directory that points to that It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that compressed disks are actually logical These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical Furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level Because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk I don't know if it does or doesn' it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through 'S disk compression BIOS in order to be NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP more on permenent swap i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested will only use the size you wan't to create this swap file anyway or something like well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk Windows then suggests the smaller of the two They also said that under absolutely no windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested 's what he said I call bull If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it any takers James if this doesn't get to the net will someone post it for me thanks
