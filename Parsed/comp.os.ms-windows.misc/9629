From Greg Bishop Subject Re Borland's Paradox Offer I am considering buying Borland's Paradox for Windows since I would like to use a database with Windows I don't have use one yet for both work home I would like to advantage of Borland's until April offer if this package is everything that Borland claims it to So I was wondering has anybody used this and or have any opinions Tom Belmonte If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use I strongly suggest Approach It is extremely easy to use make reports I own both it and Paradox and I almost never use If you need to build up a complicated application then Paradox is the way to I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff work home use and you have not used a database before I recommend I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical To permanently reorder to use the old DBASE III command the records requires sorting the records appropriately no problem since I almost always use them in this order exporting the database to another database which can still be an Approach database and then copying the exported files back to the original This is a small weakness considering the other items I really like about It is also a little slower than Paradox other than the loading Paradox takes forever and a minute to load Paradox also takes a lot of memory both hard disk around and RAM Greg
