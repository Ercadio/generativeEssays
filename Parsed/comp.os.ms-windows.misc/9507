From colburn caesar alex colburn Subject Re GUI Application Frameworks for Windows In article Brett Harper writes Hello I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application I have come across a few that look good Zinc Has a platform independent resource Not too important for me right now Just a thought on resources It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and I wrote a resource converter from to Motif but it really wasn't too easy especially the naming In Motif you cannot rename controls With windows you can call the OK button ID OK in every instance this doesn't work for Motif you'd have to call it OK and Motif expects a text string rather than a So your constructor should know how to convert a define into the proper resource I'd check on how the toolkit expects names and that if it does use resources that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port By the way I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything Alex Colburn Image Analysis Facility University of Iowa
