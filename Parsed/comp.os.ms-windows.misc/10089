From fred j mccall Subject Re leaking memory resources in In APR Daniel Mittleman writes This may be an FAQ if so, please direct me to the known answer but I am getting frustrated and looking for help I am running Win with NDW on a sx with meg of memory and a meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close them I am aware this is a known problem what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it What software is the culprit Win , NDW, my applications Are some modes of Win standard, real, enhanced better than others at plugging this leak It's the applications that do this Unfortunately, even the applets that ship with Win seem to have this problem I've seen it in Solitaire, for example Are their system ini switches i can set to help plug this leak None that I know of If an application doesn't give back the resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of Windows Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM If the applications don't free up the memory and a lot of them don't , there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do about it If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside I was hoping that NDW would have plugged this, but it seems no different than in how it deals with memory and resources No This is a problem with the applications, usually When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources There are books written on this one In general, just be sure to free up everything that you ask for before you exit Unfortunately, I understand that VB will internally lose resources for you, so there's no way to avoid this entirely Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for specifically Thanks for your help As this is a common problem and I have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me email There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on the resource pool Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden Fred McC I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me
