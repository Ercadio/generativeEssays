From Phil Carmack Subject Re ATI ultra pro Drivers bad ATI ultra In article Tom Fisk STM writes In article Robertson Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI GUP Thanks The latest driver release is and can be found at in the pub pc directory structure as I checked with ATI's BBS last nite and there were no releases past We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the edges of a window when I move Has anybody else noticed this also I have the local bus card also and don't have any such problems with it now but this is the second card I've gotten the first card didn't work in VGA mode Maybe they still have some quality control I would suggest checking with ATI I went through the vendor I bought the card from since the problem showed up immediately I never was able to get through to ATI's technical support I sure like the way the card performs I have the ATI ultra pro local bus and it is fast even in Cheers Phil Thomas Fisk Internet Mayo Clinic If you don't know where Voice First Street SW you're going you'll never FAX Mail Stop STM get Rochester MN Philip Carmack Kubota Pacific Computers
