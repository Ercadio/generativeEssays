From Carol Suelzle Subject Re Windows keeps crashing Please HELP In article qur h wildstrom writes In article A Eric Bosco writes From Eric Bosco Subject Windows keeps crashing Please HELP Date Fri, Apr GMT As the subjects says, Windows keeps crashing givinh me GPF on me of late It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every day The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie I There is a way in SYS INI to turn off RAM parity checking unfortunately, my good Windows references are at home, but any standard Win reference will tell you how to do it If not, email back to me That weird memory may be producing phony parity errors Danger is, if you turn checkling off, you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting windows, however,the problem turned out to be chip simms vs chip simms I can't use chip simms in my computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever
