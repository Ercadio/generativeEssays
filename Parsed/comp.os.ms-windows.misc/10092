From Ted Rypma Subject Re Canon BJ BubbleJet and HP DeskJet nd edu wrote Size is another factor The BJ is much smaller, but the HP is built like a tank I bet the BJ would get damaged first You bet your bippy it's built like a tank and not just mechanically either This past weekend we had a nasty thunderstorm and the impossible happened I got a direct lightning strike on my house and to the second floor outlet box into which my faithful DeskJet C was connected There was a bullet sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified aluminum slag dripping from it You could actually see the electrical box through the hole The outlet itself was fried and I'm still amazed the whole damn house didn't burn down I lost electric garage door openers, vcr's, telephones all of which were on the opposite side of the house , a ZyXEL U E high speed modem, a VGA monitor, a x color monitor, the RS and parallel ports on my X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC Not a good night But, the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel port to connect to it Ted slightly singed Rypma HP Panacom Division Waterloo, Ontario
