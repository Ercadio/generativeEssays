From robert k nichols Subject Re TrueType fonts that display but do not print In article A Avinash Chopde writes I just installed a new TrueType font under MS Windows but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a LaserJet non PostScript printer But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font Yet, Write does display the font correctly on the screen This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the TrueType section of WIN INI This entry specifies the number of pels per em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts The default is I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something I'm not smiling Bob Nichols AT T Bell Laboratories
