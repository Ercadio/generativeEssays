From LEE BRIAN Subject Re WP PCF Linux RISC In article angcl Claude Angers writes In article LEE BRIAN writes In article writes In article ghhwang writes Dear friend The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is Theoretically supposed to be not any That's why everyone is arguing about RISC Personally I think CISC will win Just take a look at the Pentium Not that I like Intel architectures either but that's another bye Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc or that it will outsell them all If the first you have to remember that intel CISC like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best also Riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not even on the same order but I remember reading about years maybe about a from hypercube that did a mips was superscallar AND reordered its instruction itself so I'm not sure but I think the was a transputer so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get The newest is the which kicks anyone's butt haven't seen them used much though Anyway to respond I think the Pentium CISC is better than the more advanced RISC like the alpha the Pentium has approximately the same performance as the superduper Alpha here performance is the weird that everyone refers to this is what I heard the Alpha still kicks in the 's butt in fp again this is what I heard and in the computing world if you sell lots of chips like intel and make it faster like intel you are the winner like intel even though you have a sucky architecture from over years ago like intel If you can make a CISC chip superscalar superduperpipelined superfast with the ideas behind the RISC ideology you got a CISC And then I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over If the latest technology is a generation behind then it sucks relatively speaking Now I may sound like I like intel but I'll have to say that the is some real kick butt pile of Si and But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the or I'm gonna start brian Brian Hojo Lee Hey excuse me miss could I have a of you try the best and free UN X clone
