From LEE BRIAN Subject Re WP PCF, Linux, RISC In article C w J JLL Nyongwa CAM ORG angcl Nyongwa CAM ORG Claude Angers writes In article C rx B K LEE BRIAN writes In article qu ud writes In article C o yq M ghhwang writes Dear friend, The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about RISC hmm not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is CISC Theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer That's why everyone is arguing about RISC v s CISC Personally, I think CISC will win out Just take a look at the Pentium Not that I like Intel architectures either, but that's another story bye Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc or that it will outsell them all If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also Riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not even on the same order but I remember reading about years maybe about a T from hypercube that did a mips, was superscallar AND reordered its instruction itself so I'm not sure, but I think the T was a MHz transputer so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get mips The newest is the T which kicks anyone's butt haven't seen them used much though Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium CISC is better than the more advanced RISC e g , like the alpha, etc the MHz Pentium has approximately the same performance as the superduper MHz Alpha here, performance is the weird Specint that everyone refers to this is what I heard the Alpha still kicks in the P 's butt in fp again, this is what I heard and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips like intel , and make it faster like intel , you are the winner like intel , even though you have a sucky architecture from over years ago like intel If you can make a CISC chip superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast with the ideas behind the RISC ideology, you got a CISC chip And then I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks relatively speaking Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P is some real kick butt pile of Si and SiO But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the K line or I'm gonna start crying brian Brian Hojo Lee Hey, excuse me miss, could I have a GIF of you try Linux the best and free UN X clone
