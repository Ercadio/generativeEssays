From Nathan Gregory Subject Upgrading to Windows NT I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of First a general description of the machine as follows Motherboard Utron mhz Opti chipset meg memory cache soon I hope to drop a chip into it Fahrenheit video meg ProAudio Spectrum sound board primary disk Connor on a caching IDE controller secondary disk Conner as slave on same controller tertiary disk Fujitsu meg on Superstore ESDI controller planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on SCSI port Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo on the Floppy controller future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI Other hardware includes modem fax serial ports and a teletext board ugly dos software drives the latter Applications used include normal windows stuff excel word Quicken and Turbo Pascal Windows but the important stuff is my Audio work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows MCS Stereo and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio Also I use Stacker on the primary drive HP Newwave for my wife's use and she won't let me get rid of it and a product called Infinite Disk from Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline I plan to upgrade to NT when it becomes a released I was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on but I don't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta I expect to buy it tear off the shrink wrap and use it without hassle I know unrealistic but I can hope can't I after all I have work to do The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers and hardware specific stuff in How smoothly can I expect the upgrade to go Can I expect support for all my stuff or do I still need to scramble around downloading drivers PAS Orchid Colorado from some bbs What steps should I take to ensure the installation goes Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the I'm allergic to command lines I plan to run a pure NT Also will NT communicate with the workgroups lan What about stacker I currently have stacker on the first disk Without Stacker and the Infinite Disk product I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the system It's cramped now I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT but will there be an NT version Or will NT support compression a la Dos I know Infinite Disk will be incompatible with NT but will they offer or does anybody else a comparable product for NT and at what cost perhaps I need to ask Chili Pepper that question I can live without ID if I have to but I'd rather Will NT run my DOS apps the teletext board mainly without DOS on the system What do I need to keep around Any feedback or advice including forget NT with good reasons is much My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better multitasking environment than Windows among other reasons WAVE locks up the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files and I want better lan support than I now have Internet access etc Maybe there are better solutions than NT and if so I would appreciate hearing about them OS What's it's status these days Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the Thanks Nathan Gregory
