From mrc Mark Whalley Subject Windows Backgrounds Help I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am looking for some nifty pictures to use I've seen from previous posts that many sites exist that store pictures available through anonymous Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine what I CAN do is use 'ftpmail' mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files and or data Does anyone know of sites with Windows compatible pictures that can be accessed in such a way If you do would you please post TIA Maybe this would make a useful FAQ 'Only in silence the word Phone Only in darkness light The views expressed here are mine Only in dying life all mine and nothing whatsoever to Bright the hawk's flight on the do with GEC empty sky' Ursula Le Guin
