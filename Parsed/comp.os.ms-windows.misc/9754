From Jon GOUGH Subject Windows and multiple monitors apart Hi I am working on gathering data on the way that users use This involves getting subjects to type and use a I want to be able to watch what they are doing without being in the same It would be ideal if I could watch the session on another monitor without the subjects I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for short distances ie I will need to be approx away as the cable The PC's are connected to a TCP IP network and run Windows Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is happening on another PC Thanks Regards Jon Gough TRUST Project
