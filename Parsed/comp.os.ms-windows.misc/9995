From Keith Johnson Subject Re Viewsonic experience sought VS NEC I'd appreciate if you can email or post you positive or negative experience with this monitor especially compared to to Nanao I'd summarize if I got multiple I bought a Viewsonic for use at home but after a week I took it I felt for the money my NEC that I use at work was a much better The NEC is sharper flatter less distorted and more I have heard complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not match I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that the NEC did I personally like the non etched NEC with the OCLI filter and the tube on the was not as The had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion Also it would change brightness when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted On the postive side although not as handsome as the NEC the had a smaller footprint and was not as I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model is being sold through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on If it's available that way at a lower cost I could get more serious about For now the NEC has my vote but I'm searching for one of the new cheaper NEC 's to see if it's just as good as its older brother the before I decide which one to I have no experience with the I can never keep the Nanao models straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of all Standard employer disclaimers apply Keith Johnson Tektronix GPI ND Info Services Wilsonville OR USA Internet Voice Fax
