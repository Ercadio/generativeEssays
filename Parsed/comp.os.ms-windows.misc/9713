From wildstrom Subject Re MathCad swap file Gregg Walters writes I have MB of memory on my SX I have been running Windows without a swap file for several months Will Mathcad be happy with this, or insist on a swap file Presumeably, you mean without a permanent swap file If Windows needs a swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist Permanent is generally faster though I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't be happy with either type Ver is and so should any program conforming to the Win specification
