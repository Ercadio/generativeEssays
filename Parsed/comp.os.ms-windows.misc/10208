From Tom Haapanen Subject Re Hercules Graphite Results Tom Haapanen writes Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter It looks good on paper, and Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld I'd love to get a real world impression, though how is the speed Drivers Support A B Wuysang writes But the impressive performance of the Graphite was not its Winmark, it was its Wintach result esp the paint performance Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly imagine that there is a cheat driver for it I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of experience with it now In general, it feels FAST , although this is the first VLB card that I have tried Still, the results are impressive With my DX w MB, running at x , I've had the following WinTach results Card WP CAD Spread Paint Overall ATI Graphics Ultra ATI Ultra no aperture Hercules Graphite VL Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB had an overall WinTach score of about The Ultra Pro was nearly as fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests As an additional test, we hand timed a complex CorelDraw slide resize redraw times There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly heavy load on the CPU The Graphite redraw times averaged about seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at This jives with Steve Gibson's contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex Micrografx Draw document So far, I'm very impressed The drivers look solid, and the card flies The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's And I didn't have to wait for Build for some reliability With Hercules' software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for just or for the ISA version Call if you want to give it a try I'm a happy customer now tom haapanen software metrics inc waterloo, ont stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth now pull up that's how the corrado makes you feel car, january '
