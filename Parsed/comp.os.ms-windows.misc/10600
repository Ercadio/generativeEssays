From Gilles KHOUZAM Subject Re Equation Editor In article M VAXTOOLS chico acc iit edu Falke Bruinsma WildThing writes Hiya I'm using Word for Windows and I am quite satisfied with it, except the Equation Editor screws up all the time When I try to insert an equation it will give me two errors Fence Font not Found and Meta Font not found The real problem is that it will not display or print out the integral sign Does anyone else have this problem And how do I solve it I'm using a Z sport laptop with a Panasonic p printer, running msdos and windows Thanks, Falke We all had that problem, you need to expand the fonts manually, the program decomp is on disk the equations fonts are on disk Have fun Gel
