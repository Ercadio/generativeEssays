from david clarke subject dos emm windows prob has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging
after the installation of dos 6? i have narrowed the
problem down to emm386. if if remove (or disable) emm386, windows is ok. if emm386
is active, with noems, windows hangs. if i use auto with
emm386, the system hangs on bootup. dave. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------
