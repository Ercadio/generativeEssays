From Peter St Wecker, N YRJ Subject Western Digital C Driver I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember seeing any answers So here it is again Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD C driver might reside I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there I'm refering to the new version of the driver that came out in I have seen it on c serve, but I hesitate to d l meg at bps unless I really have to Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise or WD to mail me the new drivers, or don't they do that Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is there not much improvement over my version Thanks for the info, Peter Peter St Wecker, N YRJ Internet UUCP Dept of Physiology, Univ of North Carolina, Chapel Hill NC
