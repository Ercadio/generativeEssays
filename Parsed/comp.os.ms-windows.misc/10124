From Peter Subject Western Digital Driver I know that I've seen this question asked before but I don't remember seeing any here it is again Does any one know of an ftp site where the driver might reside I've checked cica and I'm sure it's not there I'm refering to the new version of the driver that came out in I have seen it on c serve but I hesitate to d l at bps unless I really have to Alternativly is it possible to get Paradise or WD to mail me the new drivers or don't they do Finally is it even worth the hassle of getting these things or is there not much improvement over my version Thanks for the info Peter Peter Internet UUCP of Physiology of North Carolina Chapel Hill NC
