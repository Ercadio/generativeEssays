From Edward J Kalenda Subject Re overlapped window without a title bar From article ern by Manu Das I have a overlapped window say V which has few child windows a b c etc The window shows up with all it's children Now I create another child t with a WS THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it's Style WS THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize How do I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's I used SetWindowPos and BringWindowToTop without What's happening is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go it goes behild it's The window is probobly on top but the lower windows are drawing over Try using WS CLIPSIBLING to keep the lower siblings from drawing on the top sibling's Ed ekalenda
