From Carl Fink Subject Odd mouse behavior One of my coworkers is having a very odd His mouse works fine in DOS applications if you load them from the C Under Windows the mouse pointer is present but does not Even if you load a DOS app under Windows the mouse doesn't The computer is a Zeos w Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS DOS and Windows Mouse driver is Microsoft's I've tried switching the mouse from to I've tried a different mouse I've reinstalled and I can't get the blamed thing to The only difference between his system and mine where the mouse works perfectly is that he has an expansion card with an additional parallel and serial Could that cause the problem Thanks in advance for any Carl Fink GEnie If you can't laugh at yourself then you can bet that everyone else is doing Ed Johnston
