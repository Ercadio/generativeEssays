From Brent Casavant Subject Re Permanaent Swap File with DOS dbldisk In article James Dean Barwick writes Stuff deleted more on permenent swap i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested will only use the size you wan't to create this swap file anyway or something like well a friend of mine ROBERT called microsoft and asked them what and what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk Windows then suggests the smaller of the two They also said that under absolutely no windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested 's what he said I call bull If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it any takers James Well someone at Microsoft told you Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on Creating larger than recommended swapfile I'll quote the information If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size you will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything larger than the recommended THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT we will allow the use of the larger swapfile up to four times the amount of RAM on your So as you see Microsoft does know that the information is You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he Be that what it may I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical They aren't actually incredibly in depth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on If I remember correctly you could pick up Word Excel or whatever their presentation program is for That is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational You could also pick up Microsoft Office for or something like Myself I sprang for Well hope that was helpful to And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this I really love your I need a job once I graduate also can we work something out Thanks Brent Casavant
