From Hamish Moffatt Subject Re Mouse on Com OM or COM in Windows Joseph Paparella writes I am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use COM with IRQ I don't believe IRQ is the problem I tried a mouse on COM , IRQ the usual place and it still did not like it Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM or COM The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver xx was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least support COM COM Irq COM Irq COM Irq MaxComPort I've tried this too Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second modem COM IRQ from Windows It still will not talk to that modem I created two profiles, AMSTRAD for my Amstrad modem on COM IRQ and MAESTRO for my Maestro on COM IRQ It will not talk to the Maestro at all , that their driver does not support COM and COM in windows Their suggestion was that the 'MicroSoft or PS ' setting in windows setup would work It does not Nor here Windows I can not believe that it is not possible At worst, you would need a special version of 'a' mouse driver that looked at COM and COM instead of COM and COM I know that IRQ and IRQ are normally printer port IRQs, but I I've seen nothing like that I've experimented with Logitech's mouse driver too, with no sucess have no printers attached A side note is that I would really like to assign COM to some higher IRQ, because my SoundBlaster board uses IRQ right now, I'm not using COM , but no modem that I know of allows settings other than IRQs , , , , and If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ as well Finally, a board that supports IRQs The only one I have except my IDE controller hamish Hamish Moffatt, APANA The Australian Public Cloud Nine BBS, fidonet Access Network Association Melbourne Australia intlnet Mail Titanic Software Voice for information
