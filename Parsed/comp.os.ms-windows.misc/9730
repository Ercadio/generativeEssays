From Gregg Walters Subject Mathcad swap file Reposting and summarizing for your information or additional THIS IS LONG I have of memory on my MHz an Intel math coprocessor and a hard drive with free no compression I have been running Mathcad under Windows in enhanced mode with a RAM drive Smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several I am interested in the faster Mathcad but I am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased TO USERS Will Mathcad run without a swap file or insist that I use a swap file So far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by E mail appear to be by David Fuess According to Mathsoft Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical They say this is actually a A figure of was indicated to me as a But you might try anyway by Bert Tyler I'm not all that certain that Mathcad is the culprit I have a with of main memory less for a RAMdisk and a bit for a DOS session that is opened as part of the startup process which I have been running without any When I installed the subsystem from the March Beta of the NT SDK the subsystem itself demanded the presence of a The only program I've run to date is the bit version of Freecell that came with that I gave Windows a small temporary swapfile I'm leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems by Brian Anderson What is I upgraded to Mathcad and it installed a directory for under windows system During the upgrade it told me that was by Steven V Case MathCad makes use of the You've probably heard about it is a bit Windows library that provides much of the Windows NT functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under Windows by Thomas Rhyne I also have Mb of ram and indeed Mathcad insisted on a permanent swapfile it would not run by Greg Bishop MathCAD absolutely requires RAM with swap file or RAM with swap file It will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than It is a MAJOR resource If you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about of RAM real or virtual just to load again due to the So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft's advertisement for that you need a swap file possibly as big as Looks like I would just need an swap file and would need to choose or can I between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file Apparently a subsystem ships with Mathcad how much disk space does this require I also received these answers by Dale Hample If you've got megs of RAM why not configure as a ram disk for Mathcad DOS permits different bootup Can Mathcad be configured to use such a RAM drive instead of a swap file If not I don't see how using DOS for an alternate bootup would provide Windows with this swap Some time back I remember a discussion about the issues of using a RAM drive to support a swap file but I thought this involved slower I have DOS but for various reasons have not yet done a full By the way is a full installation of DOS required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature Which files from the installation disks are required by Wildstrom Presumeably you mean without a permanent swap If Windows needs a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't Permanent is generally faster I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't be happy with either type is and so should any program conforming to the Win So far has been enough RAM to avoid the overhead of running ANY swap file I have been running Mathcad under Windows without
