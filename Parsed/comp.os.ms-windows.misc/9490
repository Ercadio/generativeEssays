From JOEL Joel Aycock Subject Re page setup in Notepad In writes I often use Notepad to view and print type I often find myself rushing to get to Print Manager to stop the printer and delete the file from the print queue because I've forgotten to reset the print margins from inches left and right to The resulting printed text looks all chopped up because of the hard returns in the source I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well until I finally got hold of the shareware binary editor and dug into there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to margins it's hardwired into code Do a SEARCH for then change the offending bytes to et Who are the guys who hardcode these options anyway I'm interested in whether the problem only rears it's ugly head for certain printers I'm using an old Epson LX or is that EX never can remember
