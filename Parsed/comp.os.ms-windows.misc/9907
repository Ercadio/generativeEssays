From Liefting W Subject Re Why is my mouse so JUMPY MS MOUSE Sean Eckton writes I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using was using I think but switched to to see if it was any better Vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click on something because my mouse jumps I can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch This is crazy I have never had so much trouble with a mouse Anyone have any solutions Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be just venting steam I think I have the same I think it is caused by the rubber ball in the mouse which doesn't roll so The detectors in the mouse notice this and whoops I hit a mine using minesweeper I think the solution will be buying a new mouse and or using a mouse
