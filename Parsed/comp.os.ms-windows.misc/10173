From Yamanari Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft In article Brett Ferrell writes In article Larry Ludes Ludwig writes munch You must of read too many OS Crash Protection is such a marketing gimick it isn't Out of months of using Windows on my new machine I've only had it crash ONCE and I don't have a run of the mill munch following is reformatted It does sound funny I will But for me it is Windows crashed on all of the time and from what I have read in PC Mag this is not the exception I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application My personal favorite Any one of the Corel programs On the other hand I have had OS crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it's own For Today I discovered a new While I was downloading with Procomm Plus For Windows running seamless with the standard VGA drivers on a run o' da mill VGA card I decided that I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my But since I've learned not to really trust seamless I fired up a full screen WinOS Whoops the download finished while WinOS was It had just gotten the pointer up so I hit alt escape to get back t the desktop I have a lot of fonts so loading takes a good long while Screen trashed Procomm hangs Well I can sorta see the mouse so I clicked on the minimized WINOS session and got back my fullscreen Windows session but the color were off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys So I closed this and got back to the desktop now fully restored PP was still sitting window open but it was no longer connected to the com port so I exited it the normal way it told me I was still online and it would hang up though it was already hung up Well load anothe no bad Shutdown and Ok refresh Now Yes everything is Nothing seems to be Let's Ah the windows list still comes OK let's try shutdown No Alright wait seconds to see if it's just running Still seems to be running OS Try shutdown Oh Enjoy the checkdisk In this case a part of the OS crashed not only itself but OS entirely which isn't even smart enough to tell when it s been compromised I guess In everyday specifically today OS gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or generally anything they aren't supposed to That's the idea In truth when a program crashes on OS it will bring the system down with The programs that would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS but programs that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS screaming to a halt task protection or For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed WP DOS locks up my It works fine under DOS or even in a dos box under Windows Admittedly it doesn't crash if I run full screen but the first time this bug big me it bit hard If windows works for you then Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS is the OS of If windows doesn't crash on you and you don't mind waiting on each task Please The only time I wait on anything under Windows is when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long I get to pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it's doing this I've downloaded with PP while printing and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS Not sure what you mean OS sees megs uses or six of these for it's own use more if you want to count WinOS Windows sees megs uses or more like if you count the disk cache as I am for OS for If memory efficiency were a big issue PC GEOS would be the current king of the Intel some of the key reasons for using OS are I probably would still use it but it would be more of an even On the other I am finally able to say with some confidence that both OS and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to For instance the machine I am sitting at runs both fine while the machine next to me constantly locks up under But ran OS without a hitch once I got it through a crash install On the whole I'd say OS is a whole lot more sensitive than Windows but there are I suppose machines that Windows just doesn't Wittism of th week I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism you should believe in yourself Ferrish Bueller Wasn't this Ferris Bueller There are stupid laws and then there are stupider than normal
