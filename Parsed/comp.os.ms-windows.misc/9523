From Robert Niland Subject Re Procomm Plus for windows Kent Iler writes I have normal procomm plus for dos but I've been considering buying the windows got really great reviews in computer I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the has a modem on a Mhz I can't see it having trouble keeping His pcplus for dos works great re What to do after the high speed modem Edition Apr This article applies only to Windows and and not to NT OS or DOS apps not running under One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS serial COM performance is seriously Almost everyone who purchases a high speed modem PEP or HST discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX at after upgrading the Overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX If the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old There are three reasons for the problem The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitters UARTs used in most PCs are primitive devices with single byte FIFO If the operating system driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and the previous one is DOS being a fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep Windows can' Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS and interrupts often take longer to Overruns are much more likely than under As soon as you report to your PC modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a More likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you'll get no useful advice at Most of the store front and mail order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term and many didn't even know what a UART Even your PC has UARTs and PS 's do or if you can upgrade your mother COM board or add a new COM board you may STILL experience errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers don't take full advantage of the Windows is improved in this regard over but I still recommend a driver Applications like ProComm Win which is what I use cannot get around this problem by If you have a modem CARD you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART and avoid overrunning it however I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a UART if I ever buy a modem Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers they need to simulate Use below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to The Hardware The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor or chips or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program WINDOWS Be sure to run it in DOS before bringing up The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a if you run it from a Windows DOS The UART has separate byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to bps although with current modem technology there's no point in pushing your luck by going over The has shorted access cycle times than the or The also has DMA capability but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use For more technical info see National Semiconductor Application Note AN So what UART component do you have Try to locate the UART on your mother board multi function I O card COM board or ISA MCA modem If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers or your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI and you won't be able to perform a chip If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports as I chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket COM If you have one or more socketed or chips you can buy plug in or low power CMOS version ICs from several suppliers typically for to The N chip is the normal pin dual in line Other styles are available but avoid any chips without the A the are presumably all OK Early Ns chips have bugs although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips National Semiconductor Chips Technology Texas Instruments Silicon Systems VLSI TurboCom warns about the pre A and Western Digital says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS and systems IBM reportedly will upgrade them If you DON'T have socketed chips you'll need to buy an after market COM or multi function If this is a modem card situation you may be To add a new COM or multi function card you'll need to either disable the port s you are replacing or re assign them to although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom Although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT AIO card from JDR Microdevices Samaritan Drive San Jose CA voice US voice other FAX US The MCT AIO and the is important sells for It is an bit ISA card providing Port Type Connector Address and IRQ Comments COM COM IRQ in socket COM ribbon COM IRQ in socket Parallel IRQ Game ribbon The kit includes a ribbon cable and connector for the secondary COM port a ribbon cable connector for the game port two bulkhead plates for the ribbon based connectors and a to adaptor Each port can be individually disabled and the COM ports have TX RX RTS CTS DTR DCD and DSR JDR also sells a Super I O m f card that also has I have heard from several people about less expensive m f I O cards with TSD Systems for the card plus per Greenfield Trading and Distributors voice FAX Their card is w one w and they sell for R S DATA SYSTEMS East Highway Longwood FL PHONE FAX LPT Game card w for I have no personal experience with any of the firms except Meanwhile back at the MCT card from I only needed two serial ports and am running out of IRQs on my PC so I disabled my built in VLSI based However with the TurboCom driver below I could have set the internals as and using IRQ The Software Situation Simply upgrading to UARTs will not completely solve common overrun The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the The Windows drivers are even less capable and the Windows drivers have the following limitations They enable only the receive FIFO and only at rates above They never enable the transmit FIFO which results in an interrupt rate of during They set the trigger level at bytes too high it's easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to With a modem sparse data and text can easily compress or more suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of bps would be The API won't accept rates above CBR The API won't let DOS programs know there is a there and even if it did DOS programs that aren't aware get little benefit from a port with the standard They don't allow IRQ sharing for The BIOS doesn't initialize properly in many Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port speed options above These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after but before Rumors suggest they may be solved in Windows You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of TurboCom current version from Bio Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division Beacon Hill Lane Ashland OR voice FAX BBS MCImail CompuServe Price was around as I Bio Eng is not set up to accept credit cards so I had to send a Egghead and Software list TurboCom but as far as I know they don't stock Bio is not a software company per They apparently needed reliable hi speed serial connections for an in house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose COM driver They recently upgraded it for Windows It is run time I now have my host DTE connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and I am having ZERO problems with I routinely see transfer rates that exceed I am also using bps when linking an to my PC with lossless bi directional I Uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and Note that is still the highest rate that the Windows Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog I also have CTS RTS hardware flow control enabled and I suggest that you do the Even if you only ever transfer bit ASCII data Xon XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow The informal DEC standard for Xon Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or The byte FIFO in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon A well respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 's can't really do CTS RTS all by itself in the DOS Windows environment so using data rates above may still be Even with hardware flow control a with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in If this is your situation you may need to buy a co processed COM board but this will cost you more than a TurboCom A review of two such boards and a review of TurboCom can be found in the Feb' issue of Windows Sources I suggest trying a TurboCom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm Closing Soapbox Comments The state of RS serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer Because it is the oldest standard I O interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the In my last job with a major workstation vendor I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new That family of machines was subsequently introduced with However this is the Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I You may as well learn what you can about serial I O because this situation shows no sign of improving When arrives I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world wide whose PCs sort of work today with but will fail miserably with Without a hardware buffered UART like the and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage a modem will be a waste of Regards A East Harmony Road Bob Niland Suite Internet Fort Collins CO CompuServe Copyright Robert Niland All Rights
