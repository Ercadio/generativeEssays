From Jamie Scuglia Subject Workspace Managers for Win a small review Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows I found shareware Workspace Managers from Australia's MS WINDOWS archive which mirrors some sites in the The three I found were WORKSPACES This was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that I It is very easy to It displays a small window containing buttons plus an extra button for configuration One annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button for the thing to go Also it would have been nice if there was an ALWAYS ON TOP setting for the little window containing the workspace Maybe some user specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive WORKSHIFT While this workspace manager offered a few features that WORKSPACES lacked it was quite time consuming to set things With WORKSPACES all but the first workspace is initially With WORKSHIFT you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like what applications they Also the main window is quite large but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each With WORKSPACES there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to WORKSHIFT provides this viewing functionality which is quite BIGDESK and BACKMENU This is an interesting package which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace Other goodies include Backmenu which provides a pop up root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in X The menu is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus which is provides quite handy access to You could say it is a menu based alternative to the program Also bundled in is a program called WRUN which allows you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS instead of using the File Manager to run The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK BIGDESK works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate In fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in This means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other The BIGDESK control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged Basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow up of a particular Try each of them out for I was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the
