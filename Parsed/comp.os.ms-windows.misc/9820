From Rafael Subject Turbo C Visual Edition adn request was Re absolute newbie In article Samuel E Wiggins writes BTW how would you rate the new Borland Turbo C Visual Edition for Windows anyone Time for a new discussion maybe I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC VE and got no answers so I decided to My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me and I'm still trying to get used to Before I put my good bad points list consider I am a Turbo Pascal DOS programmer and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C just some exercises from university I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version because we used some third party libraries that required I like It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft specially the I tried to learn Codeview sometimes but never felt confortable with TC V E seems very nice to create simple apps like the examples on the ObjectWindows So far no Lets see next week or so when I will try something more It works nice even in my weak machine Mb The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version from the Workshop Some of the windows that appear on the manual have more itens than in the I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC VE from my brother as a I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because I suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese and I believe it will be far more expensive So he bought it as a present and sent to me I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland who So I'd like to ask some questions for you all I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this Is there anybody from Borland Is there any e mail address that we can contact the technical support Not for stupid questions but to ask for example why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself Is there anybody else using it around here Will the book of Petzold be useful for me I intend to use RW and ProtoGen to make the interfaces and then work on the code Answers to my e mail or Thanks in advance
