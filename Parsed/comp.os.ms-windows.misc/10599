From Tim Walls Subject Re RE re Challenge to Microsoft In article writes And I would hardly call a command that can delete a tree and a move command as a state of the art wiz bang They are damn necessary I have often cursed not being able to have some kind of recursive delete You are missing With the Windows File Manager you can MS But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete a tree it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete some files It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a wants people to buy Windows not MS knows DOS won't last Only because its crap which is noones fault but their They want you to move to Windows then later to and eventually to This way they give you a reason By deliberately crippling the product Surely Oh hold on I guess you're That certainly stinks of MicroSoft marketing But the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new technology and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long before Windows was even dreamt Want good file handling Use This product requires Microsoft DOS is Well Amen to that but I wish it were a damn sight For a dead product its used an awful And I suspect its going to carry on twitching for a long while yet which isn't doing anyone any And MicroSoft don't appear to have given up marketing DOS so it is a very unusual form of death indeed Tim Walls Sysop Protocol BBS Data Fax FidoNet AmigaNet PGP Public key available
