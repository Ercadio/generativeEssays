From David Hancock Subject PANASONIC KP X TrueType What's going on I have just added a Panasonic KP dot matrix printer to a I installed the appropriate Windows printer driver one specifically for this printer but I'm unable to persuade the poxy thing to print What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed My experiments show that all graphic images for example a line drawing from Corel Draw print GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs MS Notepad and MS Write will print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer When I print TrueType fonts some lines appear to be printed in the wrong If I change the text font to a printer font the problem is I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX snappy name emulates namely Epsom LQ and IBM ProPrinter and the same problem If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on I would be most David
