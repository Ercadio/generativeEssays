From David Hancock Subject PANASONIC KP X TrueType What's going on I have just added a Panasonic KP X pin dot matrix printer to a sx I installed the appropriate Windows printer driver i e one specifically for this printer but I'm unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly My experiments show that all graphic images for example a line drawing from Corel Draw print ok GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc MS Notepad and MS Write will print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order If I change the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX P snappy name emulates, namely Epsom LQ and IBM ProPrinter X and the same problem occurs If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most chuffed David H
