From Donald Owen Newbold Subject Re Now HPLJ Pricing While there are too many PS clones to count some of which are quite poor trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some Three questions come to mid real quick for something like Q Which version of Adobe PS will we clone Aside from the level and level issues Adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modifications upgrades fixes just as all other software vendors The level stuff may seem sound now but I assure you changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of This allows them to shift people to maintenance as well as design efforts for level Q Do we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet there have been If I had a number to call at HP or Adobe they'ld have heard from Deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to Q Do we follow the Red Book or do we follow someone's implementation Without a doubt there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's With level many issues have been refined but the Red Book does leave big big holes in the implementation specific It would be nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given an identical set of Q Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test The primary source we use is And having characterizes their PS ATS files of them over half are taken from It may not ideal but the ATS files are what the printer vendors I'm sure that Adobe uses them too but Adobe's output is by definition correct even if its Yes there are some very poor We've seen them here at Rastek a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript Some are poor for lack of design some are poor because they followed the Red Book and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS Don Newbold
