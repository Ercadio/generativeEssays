From Andrew Tong Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft Yamanari writes I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application My personal favorite Any one of the Corel programs On the other hand I have had OS crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it's own I do know that IBM systems the PS in particular have absolutely no problem with OS never had a random crash while running any of my programs under OS In fact I don't remember ever Of course I really don't run any OS programs just the same bunch of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been And when I had the this is the system running Dos Windows I had only one crash and it was FTP had a tendency to crash whenever I would get large files from particularly fast clients DTR's sec I figured out the problem was with smartdrv's write buffering if I turned off the write buffer everything would work FTP under OS has never locked I can even format floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed WP DOS locks up my Yeah I guess I'm willing to admit that OS is somewhat sensitive to specific for DOS works perfectly fine on my Please The only time I wait on anything under Windows is when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long I get to pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it's doing this I've downloaded with PP while printing Well I save all my personal files to floppy and when i did that under Windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the I also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the and not being able to address your memory better than DOS Not sure what you mean The idea is that OS 's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS I let XPL a shareware calculus program see around of free conventional memory which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight DOS where it would see around of conventional I also found it really handy for my own DOS based programs which without any re writing could now handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations Of course the point is now moot since the OS programs I now write simply never run into memory I never programmed for Windows so I don't have much of a comparison here
