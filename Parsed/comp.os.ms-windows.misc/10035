From Christopher F Wroten Subject Question on EISA video board performance I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs E is only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't what I would call I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's Since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board such as a Diamond SpeedStar From PC Magazine's I think recent report I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card but it's around which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to And for I could get a Diamond Viper and still have left over of course I'd have to get a Local Bus mother board Can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration Thanks Christopher Wroten
