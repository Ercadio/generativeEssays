From David Eastwood Subject WRK Installation Oddity Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows Resource Kit The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally but when it had finished there was no Program Group Now I know I've done this before successfully and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax me but I'm curious as to what might be going I can only assume that something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in the way but I can't figure out Any clues anyone David Eastwood Sybase Emeryville CA
