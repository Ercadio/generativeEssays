From Alan Walford Subject Workgroup Questions conven ram and licensing I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few questions about Windows for Workgroups I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver I am considering moving all our machines to W WG Q How much conventional ram does W WG use over and above the driver for the network card Q If I have a Novell NE card, are the LSL and IPX drivers still needed Q Does W WG do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of W WG Note I do not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy of W WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies Q If you buy the upgrade to Windows for W WG does it replace all of Win as you install it or does it depend on current Win files Q If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have any troubles with the W WG machines When I started this message, I was going to ask only questions but I got carried away I'll stop now I look forward to your replies Al Alan Walford Eos Systems Inc , Vancouver,B C , Canada Tel OR uunet wimsey bc ca eosvcr aew
