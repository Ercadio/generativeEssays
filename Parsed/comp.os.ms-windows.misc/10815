From Les Ferch Subject Re MAC DISKS IN WINDOWS In t miyamoto ucsee Berkeley EDU Carleton A Y Miyamoto writes In article t efv Gilles KHOUZAM writes Macsee zip on ftp cica indiana edu is supposed to read and write Mac disks I've never tried it, though Good luck I just tried it, but I can't say that it works, 'cause it doesn't read K disks, it only reads Mb If there a program that does read K disks, please let me know I'm not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the k disk I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a PC can't read it This is a hardware problem which software cannot correct Hope this helps and correct me if I'm wrong You're right You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II K disk or Apple II disk without extra hardware However, Mac MB disks can be read and written in a PC HD drive with software only This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file It sure gets asked enough
