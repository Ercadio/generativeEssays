From Eric Bosco Subject Re emm and windows In article Ardie Mack writes On my PC I almost exclusively run windows The only dos based application I have is ProcommPlus In my config sys I have emm loaded with the option noems no expanded memory Following a thread in one of the comp newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm loaded Indeed, in the manual, it says that emm is used to get expanded memory out of extended memory Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the emm device is useless in my case Should I use emm or should I remove it from my config sys Thanks for your help, Eric emm noems enables the system to use the upper memory between and That's a good place for device drivers, DOS kernal, etc Keep it in Well, I thought that highmem sys would do that too I just took out emm of my config sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high mouse, vga shadow bios, dos key etc I haven't checked mem c, but I believe I have managed to load them high ie between KB and KB Also, ever since I took out emm , windows loads slightly faster, I get about extra meg of freemem in windows I'm running enhanced with Meg RAM, Meg swap and I got rid of my ctrl alt del reboot problem before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl alt del after exiting windows I would really like to keep emm out of my config sys Anybody else have info on this Eric
