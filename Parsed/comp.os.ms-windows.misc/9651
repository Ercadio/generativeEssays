From LEE BRIAN Subject Re WP PCF Linux RISC In article writes In article ghhwang writes Dear friend The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is Some people say it's fun but I think it's very Theoretically supposed to be not any That's why everyone is arguing about RISC Personally I think CISC will win Just take a look at the Pentium Not that I like Intel architectures either but that's another bye Brian Hojo Lee Hey excuse me miss could I have a of you try the best and free UN X clone
