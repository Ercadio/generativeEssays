From Daniel M Coleman Subject Re ATI Ultra Pro Confirmation In article Fn rAZBB , Alan Walford writes I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card Some have been positive but most are negative Could people please confirm these I am interested in the EISA version in particular The card does not work in a system with M RAM The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know The VLB and EISA version should have no problems The card works in a M system with some switches set but it is much slower Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than M RAM EISA and VLB or M ISA M should not be a problem for you The card is interlaced in its bit true colour modes Nope I can use x at hz, bit and x at hz, bit, all non interlaced The latest build drivers still do not work in many cases They aren't perfect, but are much improved I don't recall the last time which I had to leave mach mode ATI GUP mode and switch to or VGA mode due to software incompatibility This card is the fastest full colour card for the money It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread I like it Daniel Matthew Coleman Internet The University of Texas at Austin DECnet UTXVMS DCOLEMAN Electrical Computer Engineering BITNET DCOLEMAN UTXVMS BITNET
