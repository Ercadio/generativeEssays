From Michael Clase Subject Print to file how do I print the file later Here's the situation At home I have MS Word for windows but no At work I have windows a postscript printer but not MS So I configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file which I then bring to My question how do I print this postscript file through the print manager at work If for example I select print from the file manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me several pages of postscript I know that I can open a DOS window and do copy which does work but seems not to multitask very well other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 's of There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print Manager but if there is I can't find any mention of it in the Anyone know how to do this Michael Clase Memorial University of Newfoundland
