From Mike Palmer Subject Re Windows On A RAMDRIVE writes Stuff del'd for bandwidth's Why sigh If you don't have more than of memory using a RAMDrive with windows is a waste of Windows will access upto RAM better as As to why what you did didn't work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the group pif ini All of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e However if you wanted to copy an application up to the RAMDrive and re setup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless you've got more than of RAM and are using whats above as the I personally have 's of RAM and run a RAMDrive with a great deal of However if you are looking to speed up windows the three things I've noted that work the best are A graphics accellerator card A co processor Even an emulator helps Some other disk cache besides Smartdrive I've tried several and Lightning for Windows and Norton Cache give me major headaches as I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on It's like it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive I estimate it's only reading a Mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed What is it that takes so much Perhaps if MS would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would be wanting to find a solution
