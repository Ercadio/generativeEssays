From Subject Windows Video Driver I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm looking for a Windows Driver for it It's based on the Cirrus Logic CL GD A PC B chip I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand and they say that only Windows divers were ever written by the manufacturer So if there's a V driver out for this chip set I'd like to know preferably by e mail at Thanks is advance Ross James
