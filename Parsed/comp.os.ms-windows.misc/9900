From duncans Duncan Smith Subject Question about LocalTalk AppleShare on MS DOS system Is anyone out there running a MS DOS system with a LocalTalk board I am on an Appletalk network hooked up with a DayStar Digital MC LocalTalk Interface Board running on a PS Model I'm using the AppleShare PC software for file server and network It works fine under DOS or the Window or OS DOS But when I try to load it before Windows so that every application I run could get access to it the machine crashes hard as soon as I start up an And of course things look pretty hopeless for OS but who knows So does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup Duncan duncans
