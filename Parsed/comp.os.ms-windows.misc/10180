From Mats Tande Subject Coda Music Finale and Petrucci font problem I've been using Final from CODA for some time but suddenly it stopped using my I have a PC with lots of disk space and memory a Postscript laser Finale and I recently installed ATM I've been fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time and when I needed to do some work with Finale things didn't print It might and it might not have anything to do with the installation of ATM from to but I don't have the old ATM lying around The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print which is a rather important font I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS in the Finale section of but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't work and it's those files I When I look at the files generated the only font which appears there is I found out that if I manually changed the Courier point to Petrucci point in the file everything worked ok but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs to work And yes in the Special Font Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are listed with the correct mapping between Finale Screen and Printer Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well that is after I included OwnPS and all my other Windows applications print Petrucci and the other fonts Has anyone encountered problems like this What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software I have Are the people at Coda available on Internet or I'd be grateful for all hints and mats Internet QuikComm mats gar genor ServerP mats garp g Mats s Tande o Oslo p GR A Telemax C NO
