From Greg Bishop Subject Re Diamond SS X, Win , Mouse cursor In article A Don A B Lindbergh writes Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond x x driver Sorry, don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently delivered Gateway system Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered if anyone else had seen this As a followup, this is a co worker's machine He has the latest drivers It only happens using the x x driver Sometimes it takes a minute or so for the cursor to wig out, but it eventually does in this mode I susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants I excluded a c ff in the EMM line and in system ini The problem persisted Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components It is a mhz DX Eisa bus with an Ultrastore xx controller Ah well, I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it before Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order, but I do find folks here usually are far more in the know I use the Diamond SpeedStar X in X X mode all of the time I have NOT found distortions in the cursor The cursor is a little jumpy from time to time due to bit access to the swap file , but it is never distorted Greg Bishop
