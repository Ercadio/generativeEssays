From Anibal Mayorga Subject Disk Image Question Hello recently I noticed there is a directory named DiskImage in my I didn't notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of the disk was created or if automatically created a backup of its I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility having an image of the disk is taking a lot of disk Does anybody know if this is just something the people who installed did or it is a backup mechanism Thanks Anibal Anibal Mayorga Wenark Dr W Newark DE H
