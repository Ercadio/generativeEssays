from mark woodruff subject bigger window headings does anyone know of bigger raster fonts i'm using a mag h monitor with a diamond ss24x in 1280x1024 mode and would prefer to have larger characters
for the windows heading (practically for everything). i'm already using the
8514 character sets. mark any idea of the difference between the 15h and the 15f?
