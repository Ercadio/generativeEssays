From Thomas G Schlatter Subject Re SMARTDRV AND DBLSPACE In article rcaldrn epistat Richard Calderon writes I just received a Gateway with Windows and Dos I ran it a few times with no apparent problems I decided to give double Space a try After compressing the drive, with no problems, I decided to load windows It took minute Seconds to load after dblspace, seconds before dblspace I tinkered a little with the machine and noticed an error message saying Smartdrive cannot work with Dblspace The reason for the change from Smartdrv exe included with Windows to Smartdrv exe included with DOS is COMPATABILITY WITH DBLSPACE Be sure you are running smartdrv from your DOS directory
