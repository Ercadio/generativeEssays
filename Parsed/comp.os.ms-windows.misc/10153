From Doug V Tran Subject Re leaking memory resources in Here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application uses and how much it gives back on shut down This is take from Windows User May issue Application Min Resource Use Resource Not Returned GDI USER GDI USER WinSleuth Gold v Word For Windows v b Lotus v Arts and Leters v PowerPoint v Corel Draw v Micro Designer v CrossTalk v Excel v a HiJacck v Image In Color Pro PIcture Publisher v PowerLeads Executive Ed v Adobe Type Manager v NA NA Skylight v The numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order What does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a program that doesn't give back all of it's resources, then you continually lose these resouces Therefore, only open these programs up once and leave them open BTW Maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to watch out for later, Doug
