From Richard Spitz Subject Re Help with WinQVT swartzjh NeXTwork Rose Hulman Edu Jeff H Swartz writes when I use a name such as rosevc rose hulman edu Initiating nameserver query for 'rosevc' nameserver query time out when I use the IP number Local host or gateway not responding I know the nameserver is correct and the router is correct They work fine using NCSA telnet ftp They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET INI and QVTHOST RC are incorrect see below The docs said if you are running concurrent packet software you need to load PKTMUX Does this apply to me No, I don't think so You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you They use different packet types, so QVTNET TCP IP and NOVELL IPX SPX should be able to coexist just fine PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP IP Packages concurrently This is the qvthost rc file There is the first problem You didn't specify hostnames, just IP Addresses Your file should look like this Name of your Nameserver Name of your Router This is the beginning of the winqvt ini file net name swartzjh test rose hulman edu Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part router Instead, use router Name of your Router , as specified in your QVTHOST RC I know the release notes for say that IP addresses should work also, but apparently they don't nameserver Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work Hope it helps, Richard Dr Richard Spitz INTERNET EDV Gruppe Anaesthesie Tel Klinikum Grosshadern FAX Munich, Germany
