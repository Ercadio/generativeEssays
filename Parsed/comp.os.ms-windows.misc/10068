from william f maton subject changing system font hello i have windows 3.1 and i was wondering what is necessary to change the
default system font to something else. i have just obtained msc/c++ 7.0 with
sdk, so i'd really like to get my feet wet with doing my first windows pro-
gram to change the system font. tx., william f. maton (the mercedes-benz convertible) (the unicycle)
