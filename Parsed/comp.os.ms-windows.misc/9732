From Lamont Downs Subject Re ATM So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned on or Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these better printer technologies and TT There are some fonts that are only available as PS If you have a PS font that you want to use use Otherwise it is a waste of system Or if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use Type From what I've heard pure hearsay the results of outputting TT fonts as Type is not as good as using high quality Type fonts in the first Lamont Downs
