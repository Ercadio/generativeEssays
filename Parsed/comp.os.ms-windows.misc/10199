From Erich W Lantz Subject WordBasic time date variables I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows as a front The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load OK but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword that would move to a specified directory rename it using the current date and time and delete the original In other words gets renamed as say on May at the user gets a time indexed backup of his mail files and is freed up for the next packet of mail since my AutoExec macro points to My main question is this How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a time date variable in the new filename Thanks If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking a beer I bet it makes beer shoot out of your Jack Handey Erich Lantz Timberville VA DoD
