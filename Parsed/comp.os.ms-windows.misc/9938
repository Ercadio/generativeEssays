from thomas g schlatter subject looking for tom haapanen i'm trying to find tom haapanen, formerly who was the keeper of the faq for this newsgroup.
he was working at watrerloo engineering software,
but netfind can't even find that (but it may have
been a uucp connection). if anyone knows how to
contact tom, please let me know. thanks,
tom schlatter
