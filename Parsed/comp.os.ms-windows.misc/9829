From angcl Nyongwa CAM ORG Claude Angers Subject Re WP PCF, Linux, RISC In article C rx B K LEE BRIAN writes In article qu ud writes In article C o yq M ghhwang writes Dear friend, The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about RISC hmm not that I am an authority on RISC but I clearly remember reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large The difference is in addressing modes RISC instruction sets are not as orthogonal is CISC Theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer That's why everyone is arguing about RISC v s CISC Personally, I think CISC will win out Just take a look at the Pentium Not that I like Intel architectures either, but that's another story bye Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc or that it will outsell them all If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also Riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not even on the same order but I remember reading about years maybe about a T from hypercube that did a mips, was superscallar AND reordered its instruction itself so
