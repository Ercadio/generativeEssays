From CompuServe COM DARLA Subject DeltaPoints Animated Desktop Hiyas ALL, Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I couldn't wait to install it I had gotten an advertisement for it and put it aside with my list of 'I Wants ' After installing the software, it didn't load No part of the software would load even though the install went seemingly well I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty million different questions about my system concluded that I had one of the systems that the software was 'incompatible with' Of course they're willing to give me my back What a waste of time and energy The folks on their support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings of Windows After my experience with the installation of the SB , I learned some of the function of windows dll files Before sending back Desktop Animator, decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of dll files I had I had versions of cpalette dll one dated and K the other dated and smaller the smaller version was the one supplied with Desktop Animator I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette dll to a directory outside my path For some reason, I had the older Cpalette dll in my Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows system directory When I did this, the animator's editor loaded and so did other of the applications in the package the main application still didn't load Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions for trouble shooting Darla Portal AOL WIX darla GENIE KUBY L JJ JJ
