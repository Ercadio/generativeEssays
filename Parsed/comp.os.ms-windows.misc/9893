From Leo Lim Subject FAST DOS'VGA and windows video card info ok i have a ISA w Diamond Stealth VRAM I was really satisfied w its performance in but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA especially this new Strike this stealth vram can only give me i use my winmark was million i so right now i'm considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully can perform approx same w my current VRAM in windows and also can perform DOS' VGA preferably i also saw the benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar and Orchid Prodesigner s ware the fastest for non local bus both can give in DOS' VGA w Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type which one is the worthiest not necessarily fastest any other card recommendation is welcomed also if possible where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest thanks in advance folks Martin
