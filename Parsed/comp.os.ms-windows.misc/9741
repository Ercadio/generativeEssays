From Alan Walford Subject Summary ATI Graphics Ultra Questions etc To those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and had asked confirmation of some This message is a summary of the Thanks to all of you that The card does not work in a system with a The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only as far as I The VLB and EISA version should have no b I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't work in systems with over There is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesn't I posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this c FALSE d The VLB card which I have allows you to set memory aperture over by using their configuration No messing with jumpers The problem is probably valid only for ISA The card works in a system with some switches set but it is much a Again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than RAM EISA and VLB or M ISA should not be a problem for b c Depends on the YES if ISA NO if EISA or Localbus The card is interlaced in its true colour a I can use at bit and at bit all non b Yes According to PC Magazine they've tested a local bus version that does in bit which may or may not be c Not for the Sometimes for the Some modes may run only interlaced on certain This has nothing to do with bits only with screen Note that for bit color and Windows you MUST have megs memory size calculations The latest build drivers still do not work in many a They aren't perfect but are much I don't recall the last time which I had to leave mach mode ATI GUP mode and switch to or VGA mode due to software b Many people recommended going back to Build or c They appear to be excellent but have a few For example certain graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad do not print correctly though they do display OK on the They are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have d Overall I like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than I am running the Color mode as that is all my NT driver for October NT version seems to I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond Stealth VRAM but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old This card is the fastest full colour card for the a It's quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to b Yes I'll admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what I wanted to use it Too bad it crashed in many different ways every minutes or c Depends on many many This card is the greatest thing since sliced a I like b Well PC Magazine seems to think it c Yes this appears to be true d As to greatest thing since sliced bread I doubt Better cards are coming Who knows maybe ATI will come out with something faster Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which Pycon was developing at that PC Magazine about two months or so back Overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use That is the end of the These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed For those of you not familiar with the card I have included a summary here from an ATI ad since I don't have an Graphics Ultra ATI Graphics Ultra Plus Accelerated at colours True colour at Multimedia Video Acceleration for Indeo Video RLE and Video compressed Stretch full motion video windows to full size Fast VGA Includes button mouse ISA versions only Anti aliased fonts avail in colour mode only I think Real time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop Around a length card size Priced from ATI Graphics Ultra Pro Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus Faster performance with VRAMS Accelerated at colours non interlaced Available in ISA EISA and Microchannel Priced from ATI Technologies I hope this summary can be of use to Al I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few years which I generally liked Alan Walford Eos Systems Vancouver Canada Tel OR eosvcr aew
