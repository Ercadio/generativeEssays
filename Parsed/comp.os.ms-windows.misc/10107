From Eric Bosco Subject Where to put my swap file IDE or SCSI I have a sx and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an Adaptec non busmastering controller Yesterday I ran coretest to find out drive performance and these are the values I got Seagate Meg kb Sec ms avg seek ms track to track Quantum Meg SCSI Kb sec avg seek track to track First off all are these good results I don't know what typical values are What I'm wondering now is the following My swap file is currently on the IDE I could move it to the SCSI which is faster, but then I would not be able to use bit access which might actuall make it slower So on which drive should I put my swap file to get best results Is there a swap file speed test program out there Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI DOS driver loaded and I got no difference whatsoever in performance Is there any reason at all why I should load this driver Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses Eric
