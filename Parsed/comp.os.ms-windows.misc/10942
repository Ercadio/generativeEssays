From Peter R van Harten Subject ATI Graphics Ultra Pro problem I have the following problem on a Dell SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro EISA When I start Windows, the first times I try to run an application, it does not start Windows will show the following error message Error Executing application There is not enough memory to run the application After the first tries, the application I want to run will start, and afterwards there are no more problems When I change the Video driver from Mach to a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI drivers I tried both the build and build driver Does anyone have a clue P R van Harten Philips Research Laboratories tel Prof Holstlaan fax AA Eindhoven email The Netherlands
