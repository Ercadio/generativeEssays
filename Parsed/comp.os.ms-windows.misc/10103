from charles allen subject re why i'm not using dos anymore regarding the horror stories about dos doubledisk and stacker ?
killing hard drives: i was wondering if the dos 6 mirror command works on the doubled
drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table.
if it records the vital doubledisk info, then using it daily
should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
type of catastrophic failure discussed. if it doesn't, then
shame on microsoft.
