From leopard spud Hyperion COM Steeve Vawter Subject QUESTIONS about DOS external JOIN command I am setting up my DOS UNIX box on a M IDE and a M SCSI drive and was wondering about the use of the MS DOS JOIN command I like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C D E crap that DOS enforces I like how it would mimic mount points of UNIX filesystems I have heard that there were problems with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS Please tell leopard HYPERION COM I don't work for Hyperion, I just live here Steeven M Vawter Telephone svawter RAYNET COM Work UNIX Sys Admin
