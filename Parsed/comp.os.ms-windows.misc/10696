From Phil Lafornara Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft In article msuinfo Divya Sundaram writes Jen Kilmer writes much BS deleted for brevity Again my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell readers on our products which would conflict with the no ads philosophy of usenet Nor do we necessarily have access to info that others It certainly smacks of that Remember the POLL that you quoted saying that you had seen a of users being satisfied with DOS Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was That post sure looked like coming from a microsoftie well it sure seemed like something was not on If I recall Jen said right up front how the sample set was Where's the FUD Advocacy is GOOD but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very unethical especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that Does this mean I can flame you if I ever see you doing it Face it the groups are for the kind of things that you're preaching This is why they were created in the first place to filter out all the crap from the newsgroups that might contain real Phil Nothing I have posted here is in any way shape or form official Microsoft policy or opinion and should not be represented as such when quoted here or in any other
