From Sean Eckton Subject Re Canon BJ BubbleJet and HP DeskJet The deskjet is SLOW This is in comparison to the other printers I mentioned I have no idea how the bubblejet compares The interface between Win and the printer is just dandy, I've not had any problems with it I just bought a BJ printer a couple of days ago I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet and knew that the HP wasn't for me The BJ is pretty fast and really prints with good quality I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast Probably within a second Since Canon is giving a rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications D HFAC Brigham Young University Provo, UT
