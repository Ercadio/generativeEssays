From Ron Apland Subject Re Novell Netware In article Mahbub Anam writes I friend of mine installed at work and is hooked up to a Novell network running Netware The problem he's having is that the doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive which is confliting with the networks mapped Is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive Please e a bunch Mahbub Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your If you are using you might want to go a couple of drives higher to give you some shared drive Reboot and Novell will set its first drive one above the lastdrive in You might have to remap some of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower Make sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set to the correct drive one above the lastdrive setting in the file
