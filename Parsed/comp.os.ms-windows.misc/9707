From russ deakin OZ AU Russ Sharp Subject Character missing in TTF Word c doesn't show the period centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless I believe the character used by W W is the period centred This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W W Altering the paragraph or cedilla does alter their font graphics displayed however Is the W W character used to indicate spaces the period centred character Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF Russ Sharp ph fax Deakin University, School of Engineering Technology, Geelong, Australia
