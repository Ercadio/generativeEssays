From russ Russ Sharp Subject Character missing in TTF Word doesn't show the period centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow They overlap each other and characters on each side which is I believe the character used by is the period centred This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or Altering the paragraph or cedilla does alter their font graphics displayed however Is the character used to indicate spaces the period centred character Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF Russ Sharp ph fax Deakin University School of Engineering Technology Geelong Australia
