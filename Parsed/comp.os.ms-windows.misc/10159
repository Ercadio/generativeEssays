From taso Taso Hatzi Subject WfWorkgroups server goes deaf Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so what have you done to cure it One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network From then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf The workstation is set up to share its discs The machine is a RAM with Diamond Stealth It behaves this way with a variety of bit network adapters including a SMC It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver rather than the Diamond
