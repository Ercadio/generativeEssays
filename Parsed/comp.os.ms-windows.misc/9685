>sysedit.exe (found in your system subdirectory) to edit you .ini files.
you can add sysedit (& regedit) to a program group... they are windows
programs. >the sysedit.exe program is cool because it automatically opens you win.ini,
>system.ini, autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be edited. is it possible to get it to load other *.ini files ???? >drewster ()
