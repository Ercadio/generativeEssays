From John Bongiovanni Subject SUMMARY Borland Microsoft Database C Libraries Well I'm amazed at how successful this exercise I received responses and requests for Thanks to everyone who made it On my own I was able to find out about Codebase Accsys and Q Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without Q E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls where you send a SQL string and receive the Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Other products mentioned were Microsoft's ODBC Accsys Quadbase Codebase RBASE and Q Only ODBC Quadbase RBASE and Q E have For myself I decided on Codebase mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS UNIX etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my It works with DBASE FoxPro or Clipper However I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries and formatting query As the responses say it's available via ftp except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals the ODBC Programmer's Reference and the ODBC SDK Guide Moreover ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases that's up to drivers that should be provided by database Also it's Windows only it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK Nevertheless it's a start at a SQL interface standard and should make life interesting in the Here's my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases Paradox FoxPro from within C programs I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some Failing that any other access would still be better than I'd also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same If other people are interested I'll prepare a summary of what I'm told and post Thanks to Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you The current version is which is fully compatible with ack Paradox Why the versions are different I don't PD Engine was compatible with Pdox and It consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal I think turbo Pascal and up and C I think either Microsoft or Borland reading the it's Borland Paradox Engine Database Frameworks Works with any Borland C C Mocrosoft C or later Turbo C for Windows Turbo Pascal or later TP for Windows or For Framework applications BC or later or MS C C It does have support for object I haven't had a real chance to really use it but it looks fairly I'm planning to use it this Rick Rick Osterberg Harvard Yard Mail Center Cambridge MA USA Borland has a product which is called Paradox I do not know about The paradox engine I know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for SQL but it will enable you to save and restore records has locking et Supposedly the Paradox for Windows was impemented on top of Charles Parker Technical Support CenterLine Software cyberspace momma don't let yer children grow up to be cowboys I know Borland has a library of routines for accessing PARADOX from within a C They recently came out with version This works with both Borland and Microsoft's C shailesh bhobe att psp MS has put their ODBC SDK into the public domain it's big I believe MB but worth downloading over a fast Look at in vendor microsoft odbc Also some companies are starting to provide SQL engines I just got one for RBASE not exactly cheap at but it allows programs in C or VBASIC under DOS or Windows to talk to data bases using SQL functions in your hth Walter Knopf Fermilab Check out the ODBC toolikt from It is available on vendor microsoft odbc This is the way that we've chosen to access databases from all of our mj PPPPP SSSSSIIIIII Specialists in MS Windows and Windows NT Development PP PPSS II Call for information about our OOA OOD tool PPPPP

They also sell Database Frameworks which includes the engine plus a collection with source of C classes for using the Earl Roethke I actualy have Paradox It is a library of functions large model for accessing the Paradox's It seems to be working fine but I never did try it It costs Hope it will help From David Lefebvre Borland provides a database lib called Paradox Engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other Gary Bell Department of Robotics and Digital Technology Faculty of Computing Caulfield Campus Monash University Australia Paradox Engine is the library for Paradox Artur Babecki Borland sells the Paradox Engine which has all the Paradox calls in Its hardly SQL You can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts I'm currently using it I have an eval and I've linked it in to some entry screens I've The Engine library adds about to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support but they don't really expect it till late in the or even next year They are trying to get thrid parties to help If you have any other questions let me Mike Kamlet Yes borland sells their Paradox Engine It has C C and Pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in 'C' Well at least for version of the Engine which I have costed at Egghead They now have version of the engine and a separate C class package for Michael Kersenbrock ADC Kentrox Portland Oregon uunet kentrox michaelk I've used AccSys for Paradox new version is almost ready for Paradox to access Paradox files from Its pretty Not SQL Have heard of Borland Paradox Engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is Hope this helps good luck chris From Christopher Fernandes Borland sells their Paradox Engine It's a library of functions for accessing paradox DB It comes with libraries for MS C BCC Turbo Pascal v and I believe it comes with Turbo Pascal Win libraries as The C libraries come in both DOS and Windows flavors the win stuff being dll's When I got it it also came with Crystal Reports which is a graphical report It allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using Pdox I don't know if they still offer it or what the current price is I paid something like for an upgrade from the earlier version Hope this David Taylor The Commander It is easier to change the Internet specification to fit the program Also than vice And Author Unknown but very wise If you want to do SQL from within your programs check out I don't have their address oops yes I do QuadBase Systems Lucerne Dr Sunnyvale CA USA phone voice fax Ask for the SQL Win demo It looked good to me I have a background in embedded SQL in Ingres this looked real similar It's a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that'll probably run about Good luck Best Tom DeLosh From Tom Delosh Borland has the Paradox Engine It has libraries for both C and Pascal to access Paradox files under DOS But for Paradox I believe you'd have buy have the SQL Link since Pdox itself isn't SQL I've used the engine for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with Under DOS it's a real It tacks on about to the size of your tim ma associate programmer university of utah email I don't know about Microsoft but Borland sells the Paradox Engine for C C Pascal in one package And if you want dBase compatible files there is a library called CodeBase from Sequiter software that works with C C From David Ray We're using Q E database libraries to do what you It's a set of DLL's accessed through a common API to talk to most of the major database We're using it to build an application that queries several databases using SQL All access using Q E is done using The package is available through Microway in I believe it is produced by Pioneer Systems in the We have no association with Microway or Pioneer Systems other than being satisfied Feel free to mail me for further Chris Programming for NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Chris Hutchinson Box Research Programmer University of New England Armidale NSW Paradox Engine provides a complete set of C libraries for accessing Paradox However it seems that it supports only Borland Turbo C and MicroSoft When I tried to compile the engine's sample applications with the Waterloo WATCOM C C bit compiler it complains that the library file is missing even though I am quite certain that the file is NOT part of WATCOM C or the Anybody have any success with other C compilers I'm currently developing an with Borland's Paradox Engine for C it also comes in Pascal which has recently gone to version PX Engine is compatible with Paradox and downward w There are indeed C libs for Fox access but I can't think of the names offhand I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the C Users Journal which is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX over the past year wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser but I'm staying with it for now it's like a bad marriage I've got too much time invested in learning and work arounds But if your interest is limited to a simple single user interface you want to build your own SQL engine I take it PX Engine will do the job easily it doesn't sound like you'll be bumping into any of the If you do write me I may be able to point you in the right From raymond Borland has a Paradox Engine and Database Framework which gives you a C and assembler API to Paradox This is part of BOCA Borland's Object Component They have technical briefs on BOCA PdoxEng and other products of From jdm James McNamara
