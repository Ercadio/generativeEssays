Subject Re Cirrus Logic Graph Card From andy gardner In article qms c , Wolfgang Jung writes After setting up Windows for using my Cirrus Logic VLB GraphicsCard It moved a normal Window from one place to another What I was wondering why is it not using the BITBLT Engine which is suuposed to be on the Chip How are the experiences here Have I done something wrong The has its own set of drivers You may be using the drivers intended for the or by mistake Be sure you have the driver version I installed the MSWIN MultiResolution drivers which where supplied with the Card Don't quote me on this one, but I'd steer clear of the multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution without exiting Windows I think it's buggy Also if there are new hopefully faster drrivers around I would love to how to get hold of them ftp or whatsoever Version drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon Unfortunately, their not available via FTP, you have to dial up their BBS in the USA I do this from NZ using a k modem to cut down on phone bills It took me around minutes to download the v driver Good Luck, Andy Gardner, Wellington, New Zealand Te Whanga nui a Tara, Aotearoa
