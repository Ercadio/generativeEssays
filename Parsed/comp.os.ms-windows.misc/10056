From bonobo David Victor Subject Windows enhanced mode how to get icon functionality I recently set Windows up on my VLB system and I didn't notice until last night that I don't have the icon in my control I don't remember Windows setup asking me about enhanced mode whether I wanted it or not Now I've got a program that I just bought Aldus Freehand that is telling me that I should be running Windows in enhanced mode looks like I'm running in standard mode How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie Are there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows to not want to give you enhanced mode Thanks for any help David Victor
