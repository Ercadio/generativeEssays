From Rajiev Gupta Subject Re Questions about Windows NT Help In article C Cq FC Minghua SHAN writes I don't know much about Windows NT, but I've always thought that Win NT would run only on Intel compatable systems We are setting up a network which includes a SUN Sparc Server and about a dozen PC's Some people suggest that we run Windows NT on the SUN Sparc Server replacing the current OS SunOS I don't know whether this is possible and whether this would do us any good I would appreciate any help on answering a few questions below Does Windows NT run on Sun Sparc Server If the answer to question is yes, does it run unix applications such as SAS for unix Is Windows NT a multiuser OS When will Windows NT be released Is there any telephone number that I can call and get more info on Win NT Thank you Minghua Shan As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R series of processors only I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support sometime in the future I am not sure what you mean by running unix applications You would have to have SAS for WIN NT or maybe SAS for WIN etc I have read that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May Comdex Spring Hope this helps Rajiev Gupta Rajiev GUPTA Eurocontrol CFMU Disclaimer Rue de la Loi These are my views, Tel B BRUXELLES not my companies Fax Belgium
