From Ashok Aiyar Subject Setting up a SLIP client under DOS and Windows long I have been posting monthly how to setup a SLIP client on a PC posts for a few months Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month for which I apologize This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at Best wishes, Ashok begin SLIP TXT Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows, here are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment I thank the Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments Configuring your Modem a Turn off DTR AT D W I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use to dial my SLIP server QMODEM drops DTR when I exit the program and therefore hangs up the line If you use a program like Kermit or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit NOTE If you use Univ of Minn PHONE to dial and establish a SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR b Dial and establish the SLIP connection first This can be done automatically if you use a program like PHONE from the University of Minnesota which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the SLIP packet driver The PHONE scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with other SLIP server In addition, while the only packet driver that PHONE works with is UMSLIP currently , it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and batch file examples Configuring the SLIP drivers There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available CSLIPPER EXE Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver SLIPPER EXE Peter Tattam's SLIP driver SLIP COM Crynwr driver I like Phil Burn's modified driver ETHERSL COM Crynwr driver ethernet simulation over SLIP UMSLIP COM Univ of Minnesota driver based on SLIP Of these four, I vastly prefer C SLIPPER EXE over SLIP COM or ETHERSL COM for the following reasons a It is much faster even though my modem has just a UART b While using EtherSLIP SLIP UMSLIP, myself and several others have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a long FTP transfer c It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode d When used in Ethernet simulation mode C SLIPPER seem to work with every TCP IP application that I have tested it with Instructions for C SLIPPER EXE and you do not use PHONE a Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC BAT file according to instructions For instance if you have a v bis modem on COM slipper com vec baud b If you use DOS TCP IP applications in Win DOS boxes, then use the double ended packet driver shim WinPKT COM this creates a virtual packet driver at x DOS applications in native mode, DOS applications in Windows DOS boxes and Windows applications can all use this virtual driver at x winpkt com x x c If you use QVT Net, load PKTINT COM next QVT net is configured in QVTNET INI to use the interrupt at x pktint com Instructions for SLIP COM a Try getting a version SLIP driver Philip Burns of Northwestern University has a modified SLIP COM driver that is better at hardware handshaking This driver is distributed along with NuPOP b Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection My modem is a V bis modem on COM , so here is how I would load the driver slip w x h SLIP x f c As discussed above if you use DOS TCP IP applications in Windows x DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT COM winpkt com x x d If you use WinQVT net, load PKTINT COM pktint com Instructions for ETHERSL COM If you choose to use ETHERSL COM instead of SLIP COM, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference You will have to DELETE the line device vcd from the Enh section of SYSTEM INI This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm applications such as Crosstalk , and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications This is therefore not recommended ETHERSLIP would be loaded as ethersl w x h x f Configuring Windows a Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM INI file Enh section i List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts COM Base F COM Irq COM Base F COM Irq COM Base E COM Irq This can also be done from within Windows Control Panel, but double clicking on the Ports icon ii Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer COM Buffer iii Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish to use for your modem to ZERO This is the amount of time that Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to another application If you use WinQVT net and then want to switch from one session to another, and this value is at the default value of seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash COM AutoAssign This can also be done from within Windows Control Panel Double click on Enhanced, and under Device Contention , set the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to Never Warn Additional notes What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each SLIP session I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET INI each time that I establish a SLIP connection If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the configuration for you However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP will not work over a SLIP connection To get QVTNet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following Edit the QVTNET INI file Let the net section look like this net name ip netmask or whatever is appropriate for you arptime packet vector or whatever is appropriate Save the changes, and then write protect this file attrib r qvtnet ini Start your slip connection, and remember the name and IP address that you are assigned Each time you start QVT net x, the general configuration dialog box will open Enter the name and IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on OK , and you should be up and running The changes you make will not be saved, as QVTNET INI is write protected A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address assignment is provided by Victor Menayang Victor uses the program bootpq to semi automate qvtnet preparation Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a file called myip Another file noip is essentially a complete QVTNET INI file that lacks the IP address In the final step myip and noip are copied into a single QVTNET INI file An example of Victor's batch file is provided below slipper com pktint com bootpq i ip s myip bootpq i My IP is s copy q net myip noip e com qvtnet qvtnet ini del q myip echo off echo echo Ready to run WinQVTnet For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor Menayang QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT net How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP COM packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ETHERSL COM PKTMUX will work with C SLIPPER EXE, when C SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode An example of this configuration is shown below The latest release of PKTMUX is c and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like Trumpet for Windows to be released very shortly from AUTOEXEC BAT lh c slipper com vec baud ether packet driver lh pktmux pktmux loaded for virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv f first virtual packet driver used for QVT net lh pktint com QVT net pktint com pktdrv PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within Windows DOS boxes For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is directed to the file popmail bat This is what popmail bat reads like pktdrv loads a virtual packet driver at x cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv u unloads the packet driver at x exit causes the DOS window to close I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP IP applications like PC Gopher It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt For example within two different DOS boxes one for POPmail and the other for Gopher, the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at x in each instance How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C SLIPPER I have a V bis V bis modem in a running Windows with a reasonably fast video card ATI Graphics Ultra Under these conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a Driver at x f QVTNet FTP client session b Driver at x in one DOS Window CUTCP tn session c Driver at x in another DOS Window Trumpet for DOS I get FTP transfer rates of kb sec while transferring compressed files This rate is comparable to that which I get with SLIP loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP IP session is active If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session is active, I get transfer rates of kb sec on the same files While there is about degradation in the performance of SLIPPER, for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the performance hit C SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode In ethernet simulation mode, C SLIPPER ver works with all the applications that I have tested it with One or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at C SLIPPER , but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX, I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads IP incorrect packet type or IP bad version number This does not seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on loss of performance What can you do if your DOS TCP IP application does not work with C SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with C SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author Peter Tattam PETER psychnet psychol utas edu au, and let him know Chances are that he can fix it In the meanwhile, you can try the following I do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C SLIPPER ver C SLIPPER is loaded at x as described above under the PKTMUX section I load ETHERSL COM at x , run the application and then terminate ETHERSL COM This also works within Windows virtual DOS boxes However a packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box at a time So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library of Medicine ethersl w x h x f loads ETHERSLIP cd gm search cd termin x terminates ETHERSLIP exit closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows If you use this method, be cautious about one thing don't have any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time After closing the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no problem BTW, the example above Grateful Med, works with no problems with C SLIPPER ver PHONE Script Files The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than the University of Minnesota server For example here is a script that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend Background To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server, and login with a username and password After doing so, I start a SLIP session with the following command slip username slip dialin cwru edu , followed by my password again Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE CMD script file CWRU TS SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar Last revised Procedure Host CWRU Login TimeOut 'CWRU TS

PHONE with other packet drivers In this example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER To use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver i e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and IRQ This batch file requires UMSLIP COM, CSLIPPER EXE, and TERMIN COM to be in the same directory or in your path All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the connection, and unload the driver when you are done being CWRUSLIP BAT echo off rem this batch file is an
