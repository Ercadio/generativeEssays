From David A Fuess Subject Re Visual c It is correct that VC is NOT considered an upgrade for C C is basically a DOS product, VC is a Windows product As Windows is not an upgrade for DOS, it is a separate operating system product line, its utilities cannot be upgrades for DOS utilities However, I have also been told that it is NOT an upgrade for QCWIN, which it should be In article AA Don H Don Hancock writes My understanding is that Visual C IS MSC Is it not What I mean is, it is intended as a logical upgrade to MSC which I own I AM VERY interested in VC , but I can't find ANYTHING about it Tell me more How's the editor Is it a TRUE windows app MSC which I love is NOT How are compile times exe sizes How smart is the linker How WELL does it do DOS apps I would like to be one of the few programmers still pumping out stuff for the DOS users out there even though I run Win I like the multitasking and I couldn't afford Desqview Will it link rd party libs easily I use LOTS of rd party libs in my DOS programs too lazy to do my own interfaces How is the debugger I make lots of mistakes Thanx If it wasn't for C, we would be using BASI, PASAL and OBOL Blue Wave QWK v David A Fuess Dir, Center for EECS Phone Fax Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
