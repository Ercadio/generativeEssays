From Daniel Mittleman Subject leaking memory resources in This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I am getting frustrated and looking for I am running Win with NDW on a with meg of memory and a meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close When I load windows I start with about resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly WPWIN VB WINQVT Lotus Organizer seem to not return all their resources when I exit After a day or two of work I often find myself down under of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell I am aware this is a known problem what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate What software is the culprit Win NDW my applications Are some modes of Win standard real enhanced better than others at plugging this leak Are their switches i can set to help plug this leak Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside I was hoping that NDW would have plugged this but it seems no different than in how it deals with memory and When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for specifically Thanks for your As this is a common problem and I have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me danny daniel david mittleman
