From Russell Lister Subject Re Why is my mouse so JUMPY MS MOUSE Sean Eckton writes I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using was using I think but switched to to see if it was any better Vertical motion is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click on something because my mouse jumps I can be moving the mouse to the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump again maybe this time to the left about inch This is crazy I have never had so much trouble with a mouse Anyone have any solutions Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be just venting steam I had the same At first I thought it was the video driver and made sure I had the most current drivers because the problem was most evident at SVGA resolution It didn't help and after a bit of experimentation determined that the problem existed in standard VGA resolution It was just much less My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in It worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic On the guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse I borrowed a new mouse a MS bus model and tried That solved the So if your mouse is old you may want to try replacing it for a newer Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications D HFAC Brigham Young University Provo UT signoff Russ Lister or well connected systen uunet rlister Comprehensive Technologies Int'l Arlington VA
