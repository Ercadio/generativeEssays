From kayman Robert Kayman Subject SUMMARY Canon HP DeskJet Hello again About a week and one half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of Specifically a comparison between the Canon BubbleJet and the Hewlett Packard DeskJet Many people asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail I Below is my original query and the responses I I have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find Some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each There are a wide range of comments each has its own There was no clear winner some like the especially its price performance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett Packard later this year around summertime and an addition to the Epson product line their first inkjet You will find that after the initial purchase the costs of re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer No one mentioned how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but I suspect they are roughly equal at about sheets laser printers will do sheets per toner cartridge Well that's a brief research summary of my personal ENJOY Hello fellow ' I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I should purchase the Canon BubbleJet the HP DeskJet I thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the Canon BubbleJet the Hewlett Packard DeskJet dpi Which is faster Is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics Which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here Which works better under Windows any driver problems etc Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc Basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and Well I bought the BJ about a month ago at the start of their rebate program on that printer it ends and I bought it from Computer Discount Warehouse because their price of couldn't be beat anywhere I looked and I think it's a HOT Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with type done on my BJ with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ which is amazing considering that the HP has ram I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as I used print manager in Windows I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders If you need CDW's phone number it's Delivery to NY was two Good luck Craig Witkowski CENG Motorola Communications Electronics Glen Rock NJ I own a Deskjet Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality on 'standard' photo copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality 'distinction' type paper things look For most applications I find copy paper fine still better than dot Comes with a Windows driver which seems to by pass print manager has a few 'intelli fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts probably faster than TrueType but haven't really tried them Can get RAM FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't The RAM cartridges can't be used as buffer soft fonts For graphics BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win There a number of dither options such as 'scatter' 'pattern' The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being Text is not so good in this Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and The range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most However a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from This printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laser like quality on normal copier Can't remember the model LX something I think I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New About a month ago I got a Canon I absolutely LOVE It is incredibly fast except for printing from PSPICE I don't know if you ever do stuff with that or Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain The only problems I've had are printing headers footers the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks Normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell it's not laser printed by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your That is if you're nearsighted like me The printer comes with its own driver for Windows I have no other The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it The teeny weeny footprint is a real plus too AND if you purchase it between now and May you get a rebate from Canon I bought mine from a store called CompUSA and the price now is I have a friend who has the HP you are looking It also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it BUT it is VERY slow Hope I helped

could read the small print on the BJ Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ which is amazing considering that the HP has ram I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as I used print manager in Windows I guess I have some experience with both I have a BJ at work and a Deskjet at I prefer the The printing speed and quality are similar I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be the case for a long The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the Deskjet is quieter AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the Just my Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto Box Luling LA INTERNET Address Yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the I actually thought of some other points after I posted the The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately around the paper the Bubblejet does You are right about the graphics resolutions I tested the printers with the applications I had access to Wordperfect Harvard Graphics WinGIF Paintshop PRO and Paintbrush and could not tell a In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put The Bubblejet did I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision Finally I wanted sheet In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately more than the I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own BTW I am replacing the BJ with a Deskjet at work this month Regards Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling LA I spent some time comparing the We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ versus the Our reasons were The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon versus we felt we could see the difference Price Canon has a rebate program going on at the The BJ was our choice over the BJ we could have pages in the BJ The BJ holds only pages I As you can see up to pages on the BJ We haven't done anything big with the BJ but its performance seems reasonable under I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but I don't know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from Microsoft Hope this Thomas Frauenhofer uunet uupsi tvf Mandlebratwurst The Meal that Eats Itself Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson if I'm not suppost to study I would recommend to buy the The printing quality is a bit better but you you've got much more Don't forget the HP engine is at least years on the marked the Canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like the Epson ones is quite recently Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the Canon BubbleJet the Hewlett Packard DeskJet dpi Which is faster Is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics Which will handle large documents better I've seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers times the same picture one printed with the one with the Canon the other with the HP there was a difference in printing quality The Canon was a bit Greetz Kris When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet They have near laser quality speed and they are We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal Anyway we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very Out of Deskjets and BJ I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by Nate Whenever I buy anything I look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most I've been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so I've done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the was always at or near the I bought the because of the added dimension of colour I intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the I note that even though you can now get the the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the and are still readily available at least in the UK The following are my views experience I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the HP offered the best performance price I believe HP are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes they have the The is worth the Operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their AMERICAN owners closed them down and I can tell you that in terms of definition dpi is pretty poor anyway so dpi is just a bit less The HP comes with a reasonable set of If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack it's pretty slow with it God knows what it's like without I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to Hope this is of Regards David Just bought the BJ I thought the price couldn't be beat with rebate thru and so far it is comparable even superior to the DeskJet in print Speed Per page rate seems to be faster I don't have figures I don't print long docs Quality I think the graphics quality is Print quality is excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a The dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page print head in place I would Large docs Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages manual says up to Haven't tried Drivers No problems under WinWord doesn't want to print the envelopes the same way the Canon does Know nothing of add on Daniel Hartung Ask me about Rotaract The deskjet is This is in comparison to the other printers I I have no idea how the bubblejet The interface between and the printer is just dandy I've not had any problems with I just bought a BJ printer a couple of days I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet and knew that the HP wasn't for The BJ is pretty fast and really prints with good I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper I don't have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry VERY Probably within a Since Canon is giving a rebate until the end of May it is really a good Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications Wow it's funny you should ask I'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last I was really worried that I wouldn't like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser You can't tell it's not laser unless you get inches from the no problems with The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it under Windows or It works well under I have yet to install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with I had a DeskJet at work last It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully And much noisier than the I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better but I really do like it Just my Brett Sincerely Robert Kayman or In theory theory
