From Ardie Mack Subject Re emm and windows On my PC I almost exclusively run windows The only dos based application I have is ProcommPlus In my config sys I have emm loaded with the option noems no expanded memory Following a thread in one of the comp newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm loaded Indeed, in the manual, it says that emm is used to get expanded memory out of extended memory Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the emm device is useless in my case Should I use emm or should I remove it from my config sys Thanks for your help, Eric emm noems enables the system to use the upper memory between and That's a good place for device drivers, DOS kernal, etc Keep it in
