From John Munsch Subject Re ATI AVI drivers In article Andrew Houghton writes I noticed ATI had posted BETA AVI drivers for their boards on has anyone had the chance tgo try them How well do they work Very well At home a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro I can stretch an AVI window to and it will continue to play back It drops a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean one frame update every An ISA Graphics was able to do Zoom by without any perceptible performance It is the best performance I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board which uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA bus at any point John Munsch
