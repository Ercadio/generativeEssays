From Karl Geitz Subject Re Data segments and memory model usage Hello phjm you wrote Firstly does Windows in enhanced mode do anything special with DLLs that have been compiled using the large memory model We are being told that even in enhanced mode Windows will load DLLs into real memory below and page lock My second question relates to static data inside Is there any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data segment DGROUP No You can allocate real static data within code segments When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global You can forget most of what was written about memory Under you have paged virtual You can lock every block without hampering the memory You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock Unlocking the memory An besides DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's that happen to be called by another Karl W Salzgitter TEL FAX CIS BIX geitzkwg CrossPoint
