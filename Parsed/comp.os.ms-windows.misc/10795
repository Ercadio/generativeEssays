From Karl W Geitz Subject Re Data segments and memory model usage Hello phjm, you wrote Firstly, does Windows in enhanced mode do anything special with DLLs that have been compiled using the large memory model No We are being told that even in enhanced mode Windows will load DLLs into real memory below K and page lock it No My second question relates to static data inside DLLs Is there any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data segment DGROUP No, but You can allocate real static data within code segments When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap You can forget most of what was written about memory management Under you have paged virtual memory You can lock every block without hampering the memory manager You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock Unlocking the memory block An besides DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called by another task Karl Karl W Geitz, Hauptstr , W Salzgitter , TEL FAX CIS , BIX geitzkwg CrossPoint v
