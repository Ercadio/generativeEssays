From fred j mccall Subject Re Question on EISA video board performance In charles allen writes From article by Christopher F Wroten I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA For instance the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs E is only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus which isn't what I would call I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't as a group on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards given that EISA video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of ISA's Good Answer The EISA bus does move bits rather than ISA's But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA I think that's either or The local bus designs also move bits like the EISA but they move the data at the cpu speed up to So on a cpu the local bus is moving data at mhz and the EISA is moving data at or So the local bus should be to times faster than EISA on a mhz EISA should be about two maybe times as fast as I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide at least but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a rate so I would expect performance to be that of an ISA So I guess for me the question is unanswered I would expect him to be able to see a speed difference and he apparently does Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real Mary Shafer NASA Ames Dryden I don't speak for others and they don't speak for
