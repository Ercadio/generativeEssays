From fred j mccall Subject Re Question on EISA video board performance In A charles allen writes From article C uBG K , by Christopher F Wroten I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA counterparts For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs E is only about as fast as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't what I would call fast I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video cards have a bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's bits Good question Answer The EISA bus does move bits rather than ISA's But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus I think that's either or mhz The local bus designs also move bits like the EISA, but they move the data at the cpu speed, up to mhz So, on a mhz cpu, the local bus is moving bit data at mhz, and the EISA is moving bit data at or mhz So the local bus should be to times faster than EISA on a mhz cpu EISA should be about two maybe times as fast as ISA I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA board Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide at least , but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a rate, so I would expect performance to be x x that of an ISA card So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still I would expect him to be able to see a x speed difference, and he apparently does not Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden Fred McC I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me
