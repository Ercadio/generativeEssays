From Derek Piasecki Subject Re Ami Pro and PCTools compress Doesn't like being moved Sorry about that don't want to alarm I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and I reinstalled Ami Pro and ran compress again with no I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had bytes left while FTPing although I would think it wouldn't matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time and I made space available immediately But whatever the cause it is working Derek
