From Mark J Marlow Subject Re Video cards with BNC connectors Mike Mills writes Hello, I just recently bought a NEC FG In order to get the highest possible quality and refresh rates, I'd like to know if there are any accelerator cards with BNC connectors as opposed to the usual d sub connector I do not know of any VGA type cards that have BNC outputs but, EXTRON sells a VGA to BNC cable set that works good with my FG If you are trying to optimize the display with a good video card try contacting , get nine I use and like the level card Thanks for any information, Mike Mills E Mail , rutgers, uunet ukma sam UK Math Sciences Dept work home Mark Marlow
