from mike mills subject video cards with bnc connectors hello, i just recently bought a nec fg in order to get the highest possible quality
and refresh rates, i'd like to know if there are any accelerator cards with
bnc connectors (as opposed to the usual d-sub connector)? thanks for any information, -- --mike mills e-mail: , {rutgers, uunet}!ukma!sam
