From Subject Help finding best Development Kit I'm new to the MS Windows world and while a fairly competent Sparc Nextstep programmer I have no idea which development kit to I have heard good things about Borland C with Application Frameworks and Microsoft's Visual C with SDK What I would like is peoples comments on which package or set of tools they find useful or productive and There are a plethora of other kits such as GUI toolkits available and I'm wondering which of these are best in terms of reliability plug and go type operation readability and so I'd be interested in comments on these or anything else you may find I will summarize to the net if there is enough Thanks Veenu
