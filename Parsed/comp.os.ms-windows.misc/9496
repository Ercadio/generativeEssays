from kjell ljungqvist subject driver for panasonic kx p greetings i am looking pro a win printer driver for the panasonic laser printer
kx-p4430. (i am not sure about the order of the first letters in the
name, but the numbers are right and they are important.) i have found drivers for panasonic printers 4450 and so on, but i think there should
be drivers available where the 4430 model is included. grateful for any help! --
