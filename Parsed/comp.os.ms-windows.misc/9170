>>com1 and com2 are being used to support two 24 hour bbs lines, there you go. com1 and com3 use the same irq, therefore you can't use
a mouse on com3 and a modem on com1, or vice versa. it's a limitation
of dos. and in fact windows will not see a mouse on anything other than com1
or com2. accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new
