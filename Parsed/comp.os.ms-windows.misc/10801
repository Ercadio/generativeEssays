From Aaron Grier Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft In article Brian Grier writes I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of MS products do not even know about internet and Unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they And the abreviations have subtle differences between the different While PC users tend to customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their command You can't customize a command line interface Where have you been I can change the prompt I can make aliases so someone like me who is used to say ls can type it on my dos machine and still get a directory listing and under Unix if I don't like the command line interface I throw it out and get a different csh bash ksh sh So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize MS has made their life easier and more productive and to them that is They do not care about what innovative things MS has done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot You may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their This is Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer We here on the net are not mainstream computer A decent GUI for all variations of Unix what about Motif Or the stuff from MIT twm comes to those are pretty Heck an xwindows program runs like it likes to all the end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows with the mouse and since it is a GUI it's graphical and a bit easier to figure Something the windows people have been pressing down our throats for some time The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users running windows all flavors and the other power users running Unix and other more advanced At least right now DOS is still pretty much I can bring a copy of my latest whiz bang programming demo over to my friends house and since we both run DOS he can enjoy it OR Preferred
