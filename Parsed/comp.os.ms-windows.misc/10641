From Scott Bass Subject Re Creating a batch file from Windows NT In Scott Bass writes For Windows NT is there an alternative to the archane fairly useless DOS batch programming language For OS IBM introduced the REXX language as an alternative to Surely Windows NT should do the same thing right In lieu of the above is there ANY way to escape the CR LF in a file and continue a single command across multiple lines I have an application which exits to the system and submits a batch The batch file is created on the fly from site specific code stored within the As currently designed the line length for the stored code and the output file file is characters which is not enough for all the options that must be specified on a particular It would help tremendously if I didn't have to redesign my code to kludge around the lack of a true batch shell programming rest deleted As a followup to my post let me add that I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user so please excuse my However I'm a developer at SAS Institute and one component of the application that I support is the ability to submit a SAS batch job from within an interactive SAS The user site can enter their site specific batch profile into a dataset within our product specifying the pathname to the SAS executable specifying site specific SAS options At run time certain variables are resolved and the resolved file is written to an external ascii Then I exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is The batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive As currently designed the internal dataset has a record length of But to run the batch job the command to reinvoke SAS in batch mode requires more than Up til NT this has not been a problem since every job control shell language up til NT MVS CMS VMS UNIX had a way to escape the CR LF and enter a single command across multiple lines OS via their REXX language which is STANDARD with OS The gist of all this is since this application is for end users not within my company I have to try to develop this process using native Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows Windows And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it but I can't develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with I saw another post on this list the subject was something like Is vi available for Windows in which someone said that vi make awk and ksh was available with Microsoft What is that product Is it a separate product or part of Windows ksh would do what I need if I could count on it at all NT One last question I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run If these are native NT commands rather than network specific commands this would also help me improve this If you can comment on these commands I would appreciate Thanks again for the help Scott Bass SAS Institute Integrated Systems SAS Campus Drive Cary NC
