From John Chapman Subject TIFF file viewer needed Hello I am in need of a file viewer for bit TIFF images, to run under windows if it matters alternatively a package to run an X server on top of windows would do very well Unfortunately the budget for this is limited so whatever I end up using has to be public domain or very inexpensive Thanks in advance for any help, john
