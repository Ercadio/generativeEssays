From Pankaj Saxena U Subject TCP IP through Windows I don't know much about computers so please bear with Here's my question CONTEXT I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe an IBM running VMS MVS and log on to my When I installed SLIP on my computer I had to configure it for my modem kbs Etronics internal and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the The way it works now is that I type telnet uicvm or uicvm either will work at the DOS UICVM is the node name of the The program then dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon TELNET and are the names of batch files in my SLIP I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the PROBLEM I would like to be able to do all this under Windows because I hardly ever use DOS SLIP will not run under I talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that I use a packet driver called with They gave me instructions on how to load it before I start Windows and how to modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files in the SLIP directory to ensure that it would I did all that and I could run SLIP from Windows but there were other For one thing SLIP would not hang up the phone when I I had to run my communi cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn't For another there were too many It often took me tries to connect to the Our computer center does not support SLIP under Windows so I can't keep going back to them with more QUESTION Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows and do what SLIP is supposed to do I need a package that is not too expensive which is why I am looking for I have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost hundreds of These are the main requirements Must be able to run under Windows Must allow and IBM terminal emulation Must allow ftp file transfers since that's the only kind the mainframe No Y modem or Z modem I believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol but I'm hazy about A subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if it's a true Windows program rather than a DOS program modified to run under Windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other Any information received is Pankaj Saxena
