From Mike Tancsa Subject Windows and ATI Ultra mach chip sizing question I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA to an ATI Graphics Ultra the old mach chip I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have one problem When using windows in x , I have noticed that the tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I was using the Trident card Is there a setting in my ini files that I can change to make these smaller I could not find the FAQ for this list Mike MDTANCSA WATARTS UWATERLOO CA
