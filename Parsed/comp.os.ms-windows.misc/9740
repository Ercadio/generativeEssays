From Lei Shao Subject Re TrueType fonts that display but do not print In article A Avinash Chopde writes I just installed a new TrueType font under MS Windows but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a LaserJet non PostScript printer When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font Yet, Write does display the font correctly on the screen I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen so I assume Windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically but, how to make it do that Appreciate any help I assume you're using the driver available from cica hp v zip Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel Click on the Options button brings up another screen of choices Change the Graphics Mode from HP GL to Raster and check the box Print Truetype as graphics this is only available when you choose Raster Now you should be able to print all your truetype fonts correctly Good luck Lei Shao
