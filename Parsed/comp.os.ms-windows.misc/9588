From Linda Cornell Subject Any video gurus feel like attacking this Hi there I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows I have a with a GVGA video I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's The problem is that once Windows has been envoked the colors start changing At first I thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows however when you initially return to Windows the original colors get refreshed Also it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple ish If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows the screen gets refreshed If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network everything is I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring then from the net to this When I ran into problems I deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it When that didn't work I tried reloading Windows to no Any thoughts on things to check out I am totally baffled Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction Linda Cornell UW Office of Research
