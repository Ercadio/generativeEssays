From ALN Go NY Giants Subject Re RE Win NT what is it In article says In a previous article Alan Scott Olson wrote Two part question What is Windows NT a 'real' windows OS This past weekend a local 'hacker' radio show metioned a new product from Microsoft called 'Chicago' if I Anyone know what this is That is it Thanks a Alan Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating Unline it does not run on top of It is its own OS with Billy Gates assures us true multi tasking multithreading meets DOD security specs will run programs as well as DOS programs has multi processor support and is primarily a Server It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most It also runs OS character based apps and POSIX The DOS and bit windows apps run in a windows bit If you consider the fact that NT has the Lanman redirectors built in support for TCP IP built in support for NETBEUI comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client etc applications like schedule and a bit version of msmail the storage argument isnt an Speaking of overhead it requires at least a with megs of It iwll run with but that's like running OS with And that's just to run Also I have heard that the system files take up Megs and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig The SKD is distributed on CD I ran it on a with and it did a ton of disk swapping with a virtual memory paging It functioned but it this was the OCT build I upgraded the machine to and the performance is good At that point I installed the March Consider they are probably still working on the feature set and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code Chicogo is what I want to It is like NT a true OS with thrue multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements and does not meet DOD security specs but that's okay since it will probably be more of a client OS there are a few otehr differences but those are the main There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro oft are in intense competition so it is However I think a different relationship will arise NT will be the server N etowrk T echonology Chicogo will be the client It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so don't scorn the Anyway don't expect it Windows and DOS are supposed to be released next year read see it in so I expect that Chicogo won't be out til ' I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a Is it in Beta Is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison Just my ALN
