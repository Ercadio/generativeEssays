From Subject Terminal woes I have a VLB machine with a Wang fax When using the windows terminal application the only way I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to then go back and change it to Then it works I have it set to as the port to use I don't have anything plugged into and I've looked over the manual for all it's worth but what am I missing The modem is jumpered for which I understand means I can't use the second serial port and the modem at the same time but I'm not using the second serial port Also when using Procomm for DOS it always sees the modem and dials but doesn't always connect me when the other end Don't know if that helps Thanks Brian Reed
