From Tom Hatton Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft supporters Mike Dahmus writes In M Jim Francis writes NOTE I have been working for MS for the past years I have been a developer for the past OS is technically superior to Windows Considering that MS makes more money per copy of OS sold than IBM and we co wrote most of it Differences between OS and OS OS had about half the memory requirements OS was quicker even at half the memory OS was much more stable Oh, and one more thing IBM did OS by themselves Yes, a lot of what OS has in common with OS x was written by you guys However, many of the things that made OS so much more successful Win OS , Workplace Shell than previous versions were IBM work So we co wrote it may be technically accurate, but it's really a red herring, as the bits that are selling the product weren't written by you Don't forget seamless Win apps on OS MS couldn't do it viz WLO but IBM managed to do it right Tom Hatton
