From Mike Lipsie MPU Subject Re Permanent Swap File In article qlja i b usenet INS CWRU Edu ak cleveland Freenet Edu Martin Linsenbigler writes When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about megs of swap file space, my meg HD was nearly empty at that time I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full and windows just took megs One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous non fragmented space I suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk, in your case I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size I have megs of RAM and windows took meg perm swap file Works very well In fact with my available HD space, about megs it won't let me make the swap file any bigger You should change your virtual mem swap file to megs I think that is what you said your RAM was It depends on what you are running We had to increase our swap file I think it is now MB when some applications couldn't run without everything else closed Mike Lipsie work Mitsubishi Electronic Research Laboratory home mikel dosbears UUCP
