From shiva Matt Jacobson Subject Windows Errors and a bad memory My last question for the I have a mail order no name notebook with meg I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview but and constantly crash on me most commonly citing a memory parity The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re My CMOS ticks off counts all the memory every startup and there is never a problem with this Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware I remember having some disk error problems when installing Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening I think win vs win s produce different crashes but both crash frequently nonetheless I know this is a pain but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account doesn't have And I will stop asking questions Thank Chet Pager
