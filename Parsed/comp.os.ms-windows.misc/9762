From Ralf Rutherford Subject Re Workgroup Questions conven ram and licensing In article rA AB, Alan Walford writes I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few questions about Windows for Workgroups I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver I am considering moving all our machines to W WG Q How much conventional ram does W WG use over and above the driver for the network card about Kbyte without Novell support Q If I have a Novell NE card, are the LSL and IPX drivers still needed No Q Does W WG do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of W WG Note I do not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy of W WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies No Q If you buy the upgrade to Windows for W WG does it replace all of Win as you install it or does it depend on current Win files Nearly all Q If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have any troubles with the W WG machines We run mixed WNT beta and W WG, no problem apart from printer sharing beta problem When I started this message, I was going to ask only questions but I got carried away I'll stop now We had problems with mouse drivers using W WG where Windows didn't, seems to be more critical about it It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on x e , we changed it to x , now everything is allright, I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well I look forward to your replies Al Alan Walford Eos Systems Inc , Vancouver,B C , Canada Tel OR uunet wimsey bc ca eosvcr aew Ralf Rutherford Telecom Aust MHSnet Network Services Snail Blackburn Rd, Clayton Vic Customised Software Solutions Australia Center Melbourne Phone FAX
