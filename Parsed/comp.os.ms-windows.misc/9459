from mike mccollister subject faster oak vga drivers i'm using an oak based vga card on my computer x 80x256). i've
downloaded the driver from ftp.cica.indiana.edu and i've had good luck
with it. however, does anyone know if a faster driver is available for
this card? thanks, mike _________________________________________________________________________ / /|
