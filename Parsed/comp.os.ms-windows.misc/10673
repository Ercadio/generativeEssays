From Dave Laudicina Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft For the most part this newsgroup is attack Microsoft has been attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products the intelligence of our people the integrity of our business ANYONE would get defensive when being baselessly We are human beings as You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might feel is unwarranted is Ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the MS stock price if you need some Just keep doing the great job you have done in the Thx Dave L
