From Brian Grier Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft supporters Since I started this twist of this thread Kurt Bollacker writes I believe that enough is inferior to make it overall as a product inferior to its competition Apple System , OS , NeXTStep , UNIX Xwindows pick your favorite flavor In other words, it is your opinion that MSW is inferior to its competition That's not the same as MSW being objectively inferior No It is technically inferior to the OS GUIs that I listed I have already described why To say briefly Actually you fell into the above because you said I believe If you had used the rest of this post in your previous post I do not think anyone would have agrued with you System easier to learn and use There have been independent studies to that effect OS Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking NeXTSTep easier to learn, use, and program More stable multitasking UNIX X As easy to learn and use More stable multitasking The following three are not the competition for Windows IMHO of course System Does not currently run on Intel boxes NeXTSTep Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not x Unix X With the exception of OS all of the above will require most users to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that run under these OS's And basically money speaks louder than anything else You keep saying More stable multitasking is what you mean Not Multi finder GEM GeoWorks co operative multi tasking but real honest to goodness prioritized pre emptive multi tasking With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not an issue Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for quite a long time, but are still to blind to know it By this criterion, it is inferior If you have another, then perhaps I am incorrect Do you pick up the glove Why pick it up You stated the reasons behind your opinions Stated them in a very straight forward, though over protective, manner And aside from my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in agreement Does Tim Glauert agree Let's wait and see Disclaimer The opinions expressed are mine not those of BNR Brian, WS S ST TT User Developer If I wanted a computer to play games Bell Northern Research on I'd buy an Amiga However I have Research Triangle Park, NC real work to do So please get lost
