From Richard Spitz Subject Re Windows for WorkGroups and LAN Workplace Flint W Flint Waters writes Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W WG and Lan Workplace for DOS at the same time Yup We're using both and they work just fine Hopefully, someday WFWG will communicate over LWP TCPIP Right now we have to load NetBeui I use ODI with ODINSUP and all works well Hey, sounds great Does that mean that W WG works with ODI I thought it uses NDIS My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W WG work along I read in a German computer magazine that TCP IP support for W WG is just around the corner Anybody have any news about this Regards, Richard PS I possibly caused a dupe with this message If this message was spread twice outside of Munich, please send me a short note It would help me debug my news application Dr Richard Spitz INTERNET EDV Gruppe Anaesthesie Tel Klinikum Grosshadern FAX Munich, Germany
