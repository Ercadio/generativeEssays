from ed moore subject re canon bj bubblejet and hp deskjet nd edu wrote: : the key issue that i bought my bj-200 on was ink drying speed. you really : have to try awful hard to get the bj-200 ink to smear. the hp deskjets need : 10-15 seconds to completely dry. in both cases, however, do not get your : pages wet. unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is ink, not : toner. but that should go without saying. i think the ink now used in the deskjet family is water-fast.
