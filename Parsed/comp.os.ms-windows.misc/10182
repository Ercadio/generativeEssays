From eric tgm CAM ORG Eric Trepanier Subject Why I'm not using Dos anymore In article A writes Regarding the horror stories about DOS DOUBLEDISK and STACKER killing hard drives I was wondering if the dos MIRROR command works on the doubled drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table If it records the vital DoubleDisk info, then using it daily should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the type of catastrophic failure discussed If it doesn't, then shame on Microsoft MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change from DOS It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN and a couple other crummy old DOS commands You can still use the commands if you absolutely have to, but they are not included on the distribution disks However, in MIRROR's case, I'm certain that it does not know anything about DoubleSpaced drives Eric Eric Trepanier Internet eric tgm CAM ORG CI , Grenon O Laval Quebec H N M Everybody has a right to believe in something Canada I believe I'll have another beer
