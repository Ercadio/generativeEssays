From Adam Shostack Subject Re Deir Yassin In article Get thee to a writes writes In article Get thee to a writes you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic In fact Begin who was in charge of the Irgun wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for its military Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of People But the thing was never intended to be a That this hapenned is a tragedy of war not a crime of the I agree with you Harry however you must also concede then that Arab terrorism is also a tragedy of No one is forced to blow up Terrorism is a choice made by people because they do not want to work for remember that the Palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in order to further their There are lots of military targets in There are lots of legitamate targets in Old ladies children and civilians in general are not acceptable If the only person you can kill is a civilian you hold your If that means you can't kill anyone then you can't kill Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they are easy kills is If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective I'm sure they would have done Did they make a policy of it I also don't exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as Did you mean excuse Killing a soldier and killing a civilian are two very different The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in No they killed soldiers so that the British government would The objective was not to scare civilains but show that the cost of staying was way too In contrast a terrorist kills civilains to scare other They use random violence against people to make a point that no one is safe until their demands are An analogy would be the Irgun blowing up Harrods or Sounds like a form of terrorism to me and not much removed from Arab Thats because you missed the essential point of arab terrorism which is to scare civilains away from Israel by killing those who have something to do with It is to kill Jews because they might be It is to kill people who live in Israel because of where they The targets are rarely soldiers or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of duty but innocent civilians to underscore the message that no one who deals with Israel is I'll reiterate both sides are screwy but I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they were a bit Oh you mean you favor the Israelis outnumbered to outgunned surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a peace treaty in years You favor the Jews people like Leon Klofhinger a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish You support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace Why thank you for your Adam Adam Shostack If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldn't waste them on members of John Perry Barlow
