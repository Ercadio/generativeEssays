From Phill Hallam Baker Subject Re Israel's Expansion In article Adam Shostack writes In article writes Is Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon temporary Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave Lebanon when the Lebanese government can provide guarantees that Israel will not be attacked from Lebanese soil and when the Syrians Not Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same mandate territory read Israel has no right to determine what happens in Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have Is Israel's occupation of the West Bank Gaza and Golan temporary The three are very different Israel has stated repeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan but may be willing to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace Again territorial expansion by Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the These areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no legitamate governing Citizenship was given to those residents in annexed areas who wanted The UN defines them as They are recognised as such by every nation on earth excluding one small caribean island Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking the city of Tel The Eastern mountain ridge should be This is where most of the arabs live and it is less militarily Israel should also maintain a presence in the Jordan So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any There is no money for such an If so for those of you who support it why were so many settlers moved into the territories If it is not temporary let's hear There are a number of reasons for people to move they were not moved but chose to move into disputed Note that since these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers I will address two aspects of your question why the government would allow or encourage them to move and second why they did They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied Machiavelli described the reasoning in the The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as public land The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people to move across the green They included security and The first reason was A large Jewish presense makes it difficult for terrorists to A Jewish settlements also act as fortresses in times of Theyu also are a We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks A second reason was Creating settlements brought the arabs to the negotiation Had the creation of new towns and cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in Israel where there was an arab There would have been no land left that could be called Don't fool It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can be given Not at They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Some of the communites created were They built their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of the 's and ' There are communities like this in Hebron Gaza and all There are also communities built near religious The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in Bosnia not in the West The point is there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them Whatever status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all or nothing New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not be the results of a Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of there will be no Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non Jews within what is nominaly a secular The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the Phill Hallam Baker
