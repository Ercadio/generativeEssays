From Alberto Adolfo Pinkas Subject Re Israel An Apartheid In article perlman Eric Perlman writes Now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that your opinions need some revision As I said I do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by Then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against They have been over and over They will be So far you have presented your opinions as opposed to I would hardly take them as Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem One thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long Hey what do you think dictionaries are for You quite obviously need A good dictionary gives both and you well know I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue Spanish that are comonly use and you will never find in a Even more I could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different from those in the Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious I don't think that data exist on this And guess Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term Jew which is the basis of the movement itself So the evidence shows that up to now Jew when considered in terms of Israel the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity even if of those defined as Jews in Isreal are not In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right Comparing the actions of Israel to that of the IRA is like comparing those of the US to those of Chile under Pinochet for example with the IRA in the role of You really need to get your history You also need a basic You need to start reading before My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that I consider it to be I did not comapre Israel to the I think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is That is no But once again you are defining Zionism as ONE You are implying that it is You KNOW this is not and has never been the That IS a I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some might even had been inspired by noble Does that change the final results of what happened in the USSR In the same way even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous it does not What matters is the I never said that Zionism is If you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where I said You don't say it You implied it and I showed explicitly where and how you implied Now you're trying to wriggle out of Won't wash and you know I never said it directly nor I am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists I am sure most of them are good honest and caring I am talking about the results of the Zionist I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew a country that defines nationality based on I am talking about something I consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious After all if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they were not born in the right What you said is that Judaism is defined according to religious Now this can have several different meanings and you know One of the meanings that it can have is to say that Only those who are religious are defined as Jews Another is to say that Only those who meet the religious definition of a Jew is And there are I'm not twisting your I'm trying to make you aware that your words don't mean what you think they I had never heard the definition Only those who are religious are defined as I had always seen the definition A person is a Jew is his her mother is was a Jew and if such person does not convert although I had seen people argue about the last I am not talking about the I am talking about how things are right When the debate is over I'll see what Right now things are like they Let me ask you one I understand that Israel differenciates between Citizenship and Suppose M ale and F emale have a child in Which nationality will the child's ID show according to each one of the following cases Actually it doesn' And the citizens' rights are exactly THE SAME in both cases So there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel Or what do you mean by Actually it doesn't a F and M are both Jewish b F is Jewsh and M is Jewish c F is Muslim and M is d F is Christian and M is It'll depend on what religion is practiced in the The original law of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish if memory So it follows a religious definition and not a cultural That is what I call a form of I do not know why you are so I never said that you did not support Palestinian self I just gave an example of No you didn' You had to twist the definition of the word degrees in order to do so and everyone else knows I'm not being You do not need to assume the representation of everybody else to make your You should assume that you are just talking for About the other stuff I still believe that the example was a valid It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's I never said that someone in this net is guilty of It was just an Nothing more nothing less than Why did you have to clarify what you think Because what you gave WAS NOT an IT WAS an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around It was an You are trying to justify something nobody has talked First you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the Oh so now what are dictionaries for It's not When people read what you write they have to try to associate a meaning to those Dictionaries give the meanings of words don't they yes but not all of A language is something that evolves all the It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting Not at What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been proven completely Not I posted in another post the definition of And in this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the Zionism is a form of racism even if most zionists are not racist in their individual and private A movement that ask for a State and National rights for a people and then in practice that people are defined according to religion is for me racist I never put even one syllable in your You have tried to prove this and you You did Next time be more Ha There's nothing resembling fact in what you've I NEVER added ANYTHING to what you Do you know the difference between opinion and fact Eric Perlman Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy University of Colorado Boulder AAP
