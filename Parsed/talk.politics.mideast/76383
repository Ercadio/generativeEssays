From Danny Keren Subject Re Israel's Expansion II Can someone elaborate a little on what this Libertarian movement is I am not going to draw conclusions from a small sample, but so far I recall two self described Libertarians posting here Both seems to be Incredibly ignorant Incredibly arrogant All they want is to get people angry Posses a lousy sense of humor write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical connection between topics Describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable, although everything in their posters points to the opposite Very childish Is this some campaign to smear this Libertarian party or what Danny Keren
