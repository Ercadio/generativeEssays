Road to Independence, University of California Press Berkeley and Los Angeles , , pp , Let's check it out On page of this Turkish suggested reference, under sub title, Deportation and Massacre of Turkish Armenians it states Several authors assert that Armenian resistance at Van constituted a key factor in the Turkish evacuation of Persia and motivated the Ittihadist Young Turk leaders to annihilate the Turkish Armenians The question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman Armenians has evolved into a polemic Hundreds of books, articles, and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death Many writers, such as the British Bryce and Toynbee, French Pinon, German Lepsius, American Morganthau and Gibbons, have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed The have refuted the Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti Armenian measures were deliberated by the Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war The fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within a few months, and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease, famine, and refugee life Unknown numbers of women and children were converted forcibly to Islam, possessed by Turkish men, or adopted by Moslem families Shaw, S J , 'On Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in , History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey Volume II Reform, Revolution Republic The Rise of Modern Turkey, London, Cambridge University Press pp Stanford Shaw is a paid liar revisionist for the Turkish government, and has been exposed as a plagiarizer For example Experts from an interview in Greek with Professor Spyros Vryonis from NYC's National Herald, Thanks, Mr G B Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford Shaw was due for promotion I knew him to be Turkey's man due to my reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member of the promotion committee For that case, I sat down and read his entire treatise History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey It took me three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history Shaw himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome of a year search through the Ottoman Archives Well, I went on leave and managed to show of Volume I, containing around sentences, to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages from the original work He had even reproduced the errors So I produced a pages manuscript and submitted a pages report on Shaw's plagiarism The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting, promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor I paid a price for all this upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman I asked for permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President of the University While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom Luckily, the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more than academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused to attend As a punishment, the University froze all my raises Gochnak Armenian newspaper published in the United States , May , No chance There was no
