From Alberto Adolfo Pinkas Subject Re Israel An Apartheid In article Adam Schwartz writes In article Alberto Adolfo Pinkas writes If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been expelled years ago but first I convert to any other religion can I apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I apply as someone whose mother is Jewish I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under the law of By conversion you've elected not to be a part of the Jewish Which was my By converting to another religion I do not loose my cultural identity I just loose my religious I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation At the moment you converted you officially anounced to the world that you do not consider yourself to be part of the Jewish So why should the Jewish Nation consider you to be a member To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not by my Actually if I am an atheist which is in fact like converting into a non Jewish in terms of religion I am still considered as part of the Jewish I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the Jewish Or even more I can be proud of my Jewish culture while still be convinced that the real god is another I do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation because he changed of Suppose my father is Suppose he was born in Palestine in some place which now is part of Suppose that his father and his grandfather as well as or generations before him were born in that Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father scared by all the fighting going on tries to take his family to a place more secure among people he knows who speak a language he understands who worship the same Now suppose that that place is some other Arab And now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created where my father used to live and that that country is called And that in that country Jews from all over the world are And that people whose family left thet country generation ago are recieved and granted full Should I if I decided to go back to my father's land where he was born as or generations of my family were born have the right to go back and ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after years As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to annihilate Israel the Arabs have lost their claim to land Attacking Israel is was illegal and they now have to pay the Do I feel sorry for the Palestinians Yes I But I blame the Arab nations for their problems not I still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with the individuals who happen to live In the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the human rights violations of Israel I do not think that we should assume that all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab Some people fled their homes because they were Now they are in there still suffering for what they are not And remember that we also were told the same at some We ended in the And of course I am not for doing to others what I did not want done to Adam Schwartz Alberto Pinkas
