From Bulent Murtezaoglu Subject Re ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES In article writes In article Bulent Murtezaoglu writes henrik Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik KARABAKH conflict with BM Gimme a CAPITAL letters or NOT the above is pure It BM seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities henrik Again Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending What do henrik want them to Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over News reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives CAPS don't change BM while hoping that Turkey will stay Stop and think for a moment BM will you Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict it BM is a part of henrik Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged henrik training AZERIS militarily to fight against KARABAKHI So Should I at this point break into caps and start talking about DEFENSE I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is was henrik The KARABAKHI ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for henrik years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are the henrik ones DIRECTLY involved in the They are defending henrik themselves against AZERI BM Huh You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM within their borders henrik Well history is Remember those are relocated Azeris into henrik the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN So I This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact henrik At last I hope that the insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik OCCUR BM You're not playing with a full deck are you Where would Turkey invade henrik It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik into Armenia if SHE Why would Turkey do that Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen Turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co operation Good stuff in other words I'd be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't BM Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with in the header BM in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun henrik Absolutely NOT I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases HISTORY repeats Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in ' If there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what I've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM the parties to the negotiating That's hard to do when Armenians BM are attacking Azeri henrik So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey henrik wants a PEACEFUL END to this NOT So what do you think we want War death and destruction henrik I will believe it when I see No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see henrik Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik to your HEAD Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef fat chance This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help henrik Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU All the henrik BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their I mean henrik BURNING people ALIVE Now some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by One should re hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's BM going to cause incessant henrik Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own They are henrik NOT asking They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY henrik from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful I'd say BM Think of or years down the line both of the newly independent BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM the other These people will be neighbors would it not be better BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik Don't get me I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in henrik KARABAKH will defend themselves against I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange Peace isn't what's happening right now furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to You can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right and we have the bombs so we'll do whatever we want so ' style of foreign Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other You personally can choose not to do that of course this being just The people in power shouldn't be so BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM their blood and henrik Again you are taking different Armenia HAS no intension henrik to GRAB any LAND from The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is Azeri's would disagree with you on this and the maps I've seen support what they'd be It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this BM It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks The Armenians BM in Armenia and N K will be there with the same people you seem to hate BM as their neighbors for maybe years The sooner there's peace in BM the region the better it is for them and everyone I'd push for BM compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps lock and spreading BM inflammatory half henrik It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE I am absolutely henrik for It didn't look it when I read your It would seem to me that if you can spew mis information about a boogey man you can also talk about how one might avoid the Fair henrik But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be WIPED Such as the case in the era of of henrik The Armenian You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish ' Yes boys and girls let's always talk about how bad and nasty things Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger and let's do that so our kids will also be Sounds crazy doesn't it Don't do it BM
