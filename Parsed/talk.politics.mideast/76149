From Tim Clock Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza In article Center for Policy Research writes From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Final Solution for Gaza While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto fete Since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive joyous events your misuse of it here is rather they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the Palestinians Given that however there is no comparison between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying entity to maintain order especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil Ironically international law recognizes each of these focusses that of the occupied and the occupier even though they are inherently in As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self determination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human Israel certainly cannot and should not continue its present policies towards Gazan There is however a third alternative the creation and implementation of a jewish dhimmi system with Gazans Palestinians as benignly protected Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve It is a race then Between Israel's anti Palestinian Gazan Final Solution and the Arab World's anti Israel jewish Final Solution Do you favor one neither I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel and Arab Palestinian final solution intentions exist isn't it important that BOTH Israeli and Palestinian Gazan rights be secured Elias Davidsson Iceland Tim Clock Graduate student UCI tel Department of Politics and Society fax University of California Irvine Home tel Irvine CA
