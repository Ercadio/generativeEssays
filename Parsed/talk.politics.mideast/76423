jack schmidling () reveals the true depths
of his cynicism: i do (did) contribute to the arf mortgage fund but when interest rates plumetted, i just paid it off. the problem is, i couldn't convince congress to move my home to a nicer location on federal land. in other words, mr. schmidling could care less for the plight
of the homeless, but is not above using them to score points
for his agenda. harry katz
