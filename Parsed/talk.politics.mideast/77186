From Alberto Adolfo Pinkas Subject Re Israel An Apartheid In article perlman Eric Perlman writes In article Alberto Adolfo Pinkas writes I do not want to convince This is just USENET not the real I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes I present my I think that this net is only useful to exchange I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of Now if your opinion isn't convincing anyone and it's getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn't it likely that your opinions need some revision As I said I do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the right to have a State is Zionism as a movement is more than just that In a word utter and complete horse Look the term up in the Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem One thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long I think that Zionism in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racist OK now how would YOU define And by the way you're wrong There is NO uniformity of this definition among Zionist You know this is the case it's been pointed out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain this Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right Comparing the actions of Israel to that of the IRA is like comparing those of the US to those of Chile under Pinochet for example with the IRA in the role of You really need to get your history You also need a basic You need to start reading before My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that I consider it to be I did not comapre Israel to the I think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is Stuff deleted by His statement which I was responding to with the below asserted that Zionism was uniform and monolithic I never said that Zionism is If you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where I said That is what makes the basis for Zionist However I am not considering just that but the rest of In a word I don't believe Your words tell a very different Especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and That is your I could certainly interpret this like you are running out of First you put words in my mouth now you say you do ot believe Which makes an interesting People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown us that there are some problems in a State where of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious No it doesn't Nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in G d to become a citizen of Israel Why don't you try reading for a change Did I say that the Law of Return demand a person to be religious Now how does the Law of Return define who is a Jew and who is not I said that it uses a religious standard If your mother is a Jew you are a Jew if your mother is not Jewish neither you Do not twist my words True there are debates in Israel and abroad about who is a Jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and Would you say that religious people should not have a say in that Would you deny them their right of free speech I am not talking about the I am talking about how things are right When the debate is over I'll see what Right now things are like they Let me ask you one I understand that Israel differenciates between Citizenship and Suppose M ale and F emale have a child in Which nationality will the child's ID show according to each one of the following cases a F and M are both b F is Jewsh and M is c F is Muslim and M is d F is Christian and M is e F and M are both non Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non Jews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a religious definition It's called How do you think Jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in Europe We had to know who was our I for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is NOT the religious Jew's point of view There's plenty of room for that in Zionism as you well It called At some point it was Now I believe it is According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary Merriam Webster Inc Publishers Springfield Massachusetts page hy poc ri sy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is Utter By the way I do believe the Palestinians have a right to self determination have stated so on this net and I know you've seen How do you know Had I ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that But that right to self determination cannot be at Israel's Israel's security comes first and that security must be You're also twisting words now beyond If you think that's what that definition means in this context you need a first grade course in Which definition are you now talking here about I do not know why you are so I never said that you did not support Palestinian self I just gave an example of I never said that someone in this net is guilty of It was just an Nothing more nothing less than Why did you have to clarify what you think If you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary you might be Here you have several First you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the Second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the Third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting If your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be If you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might start reading what I had actually So far you come over and over twisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said In this way you are answering to That is why you do not find it Maybe if you start reading what I had actually said and not what you added you might change your But the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you've said on this And the fact also is that you're using different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone else First there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said as if I had said Seconf anyone else is supposed to mean than I do Eric Perlman Center for Astrophysics and Space
