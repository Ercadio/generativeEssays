From David Skoll Subject Re Israel's Expansion II Please note followup In Andi Beyer writes You guys are It's funny to see people lose control and start the name calling when they realize they have no Comparing Israel to Nazi Germany is name calling of the lowest Please don't be They civil libertarians would support the Jews against the Nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them and they would support the Arabs against the Israelis and any other such oppressive regimes Iraq Do civil libertarians make no distinction between the Nazis and Israel Would you say that the Iraqis are like the Nazis If you do not make such distinctions then all injustices are equally evil and the world is a completely evil In that case we may as well give up right David Skoll
