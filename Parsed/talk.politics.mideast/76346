From Center for Policy Research Subject Re Questions to Israelis From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Questions to Israelis Dear Josh I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my Having said that I am not totally happy with your You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or You imply that citizens must identify themselves by Is that true Or are just trying to mislead the reader Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests The answer to the second question is There are all kinds of maps They are not equivalent to State You did not respond to my Your answer to the third question Israeli nuclear arsenal is You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear What evidence have you for maintaining that My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such I did not ask about cases like Vanunu everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares one for the occupier civil law and one for the occupied military law The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron it If so why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told namely that hundreds of thousands of non Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews who also left for example to Europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to How can you justify such discrimination if this is true Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland Somebody answered my regarding Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in According to that information Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh about These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem published by Cambridge University Is this book available in your library You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli I wonder how many and There is very little evidence available about As much as I know many Arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way' I am certain that if only religious communities in the would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate But Israel has always been ruled by a secular Your answer is not I would be glad to have some more input from you after these Elias
