From sera Serdar Argic Subject The Armenians did not form a distinct In article ERDEM ERGINEL writes My question is given so many separations in the Armenian community what was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century As I stated religion There are various contradictory views on the origin of the The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb The monarch Dara said I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya' On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya' To the country town of Zozo to Armaniya 'Armeniya' According to Karakashian As for 'Armenia' the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians this is more recent than the word 'Ararat' and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan' Saint Martin The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan' It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia' 'Ar' refers to a place as in Ararat Archish Aruyr Archar Arshav Arazen and Aror while 'men' is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place' Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary Haik is the diminutive form of Hai and that Hai is the name of our Our nation is in no way connected with the word Armen that foreigners apply to our ' It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place name that 'Armen' is the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai' Haik and Haiastan Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai' But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof and in any case no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Haiasa The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Professor Hachadurian 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper ' Yensen in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio' in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite Research however has proved this erroneous and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio' Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no As for Greek there is no point in even mentioning The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan' Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai' 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older According to Karakashian 'The word Haik is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren nor is it ever found employed in the forms Haika or Haykazn Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place name he improved and developed Haiastan If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from Hai or Haik they could also have used the words Haikak and Haykazn in a number of ' According to Professor Sayce who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions 'In the Hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality or The words Haddanas Haddina were used by the Assyrians to refer to the With the transformation of the d between the two a letters to y Hadinasdani was in this way transformed to Haiastan ' Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite He finds however that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of The suffix dan is of Anatolian The real root is 'Hayasa' which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas' Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark

Armenian features height a little above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often a hooked nose and a rather wide Investigations carried out by Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a distinct Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
