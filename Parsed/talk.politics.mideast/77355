From Dave Bakken Subject Re Saudi clergy condemns debut of human rights group In article alcor ILYESS BDIRA writes It looks like Ben Baz's mind and heart are also blind not only his I used to respect him today I lost the minimal amount of respect that I struggled to keep for To All Muslim netters This is the same guy who gave a Fatwah that Saudi Arabia can be used by the United Ststes to attack Iraq They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties to Saudi And me thinks if the US had not helped out the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia too or at least the eastern oilfields And no Muslim country was doing much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi Arabia indeed in some masses of citizens were demonstrating in favor of that butcher Saddam who killed lotsa Muslims just because he was killing raping and looting relatively rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the So how would have you defended Saudi Arabia and rolled back the Iraqi invasion were you in charge of Saudi Arabia Fatwah is as legitimate as this With that kind of Clergy it might be an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics if religion means official Clergy I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an official religion de facto or de jure because with human nature like it is the ambitious and not the pious will always be the ones who rise to There are just too many people in this world or any country for the citizens to really know if a leader is really devout or if he is just a slick CAIRO Egypt UPI The Cairo based Arab Organization for Human Rights AOHR Thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the Committee for Defense of Legal Rights in Saudi Arabia and said it was necessary to have such groups operating in all Arab You make it sound like these guys are angels In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff was it the following Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough The NYT reported that besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough they have asserted that the Shiites in the Kingdom are apostates a charge that under Saudi and Islamic law brings the death Diplomatic guy Sheikh bin Jibrin isn't he Ilyess called for severe punishment of the or so women who drove in public a while back to protest the ban on women The guy from the group who said this Abdelhamoud al Toweijri said that these women should be fired from their jobs jailed and branded as Is this what you want to see happen Ilyess I've heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving has no basis in the Qur'an the ahadith Yet these folks not only like the ban they want these women falsely called prostitutes If I were you I'd choose my heroes wisely Ilyess not just reflexively rally behind anyone who hates anyone you say that women should not be allowed to say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Now the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot among other I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat In the last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain religious police not government of Western women not fully veiled something stupid for women to do IMO because it sends the wrong signals about your morality And I've read that they've cracked down on the few home based expartiate religious gatherings and even posted rewards in government owned newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more conservative As unislamic as some of these things are they're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud like they're trying to in the long Is this really what you and Rached and others in the general west is evil zionists rule hate west or you are a puppet crowd want Ilyess Dave Bakken the President is doing a fine job but the problem is we don't know what to do with her James Carville Clinton campaign strategist Oh please call Mom's far too Chelsea to nurse CSPAN
