Aviv Tel Aviv's time Friday local Tel Aviv's paper affiliated with Date February Journalist Guy Ehrlich Subject Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan Cherry units which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied Excerpts from the article A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs things good and bad some of the But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane Gee I'd better tell this to the Mental Health Branch of the Israeli Army Medical Corps Where would we be without you Davidson A man who said this who will here be called Danny his full name is known to the editors served in the After his discharge from the army he works as delivery His pal who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry and is now about to depart for a round the world They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript But in their souls one can notice something completely was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy Yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the We called such soldiers 'Hit by the Intifada' Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non stop which is a common phenomenon in the I sent him to a But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane On Fridays when I come home my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach surf a little calm down and The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance so that I can go I they dare talk to me before or whenever I don't want them to talk to me I just grab a chair and smash it I know it is my nerve Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the Only there I become Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my It was an omelette of She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my I told her how I shot an Arab and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect She began to laugh I wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov He shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the Arab was burning all over just I was delighted to see My pal fired three bullets two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail and the third at his It hit him straight in his We both felt that we'd pulled off Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a I reached the spot And then that Arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at I yelled 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew So I just laughed straight in his I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my Then I told him 'All right wait a moment' I left him in order to take a look at another wounded I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like I keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my This infuriated I got very angry because I felt I was becoming So I stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her Only then she stopped At first she didn't know what to But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us I went with a friend to practice shooting on a A gull appeared right in the middle of the My friend shot it at Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the Four deer in Tel Aviv Well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this hill above My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the We shot down two deer more and went to take a When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead We carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had We were just delighted by that We had hit'em so good Then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further I approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on This made us feel cured of the spurt of our Standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of We couldn't explain what had happened to We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very We always go back to places we carried out assignments This is why we can see When you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got You feel Godlike of Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the Dudu is not willing to work in any security linked Danny feels the exact 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well Why shouldn't I earn for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa This kind of job suits me
