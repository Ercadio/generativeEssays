Resident at Building Apartment Block Sumgait Azerbaijan During the first days of the events the and the of February I was away on a business On the I had got my crew done the paper work and left for the Zhdanov That's in Azerbaijan near the Nagorno Karabagh After the rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh specifically in Stepanakert an uprising had taken They said uprising in Azerbaijani but I don't think it was really an uprising just a After that the unrest Several Armenians living in the Zhdanov District were How were they injured They were beaten even women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to Karabagh to After that I felt There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population the Armenians had done this the Armenians had done Right there at the I was attacked a couple of times by Well true the guys from my crew wouldn't let them come at me with cables and After that I felt really I didn't know where to I up and called And my children tell me There's unrest everywhere be Well I had a project going I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on and said I wanted to take my crew off the They wouldn't allow it they said Nothing's going to happen to you we've entrusted the matter to the police we've warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to Well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us I sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me The situation is very tense be We finished the job at the site and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the When we left the guys warned me they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an I took someone else's business travel documents in the name of Zardali and hid my I hid it and my passport in my We set out for Our guys were on the bus they sat behind and I sat up In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in As it turns out they knew what was happening in I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed there is no way to get That the city is closed off and the buses aren't Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two And suddenly no Well we tried to get there via private One man an Azerbaijani said Let's go find some other way to get They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to He took us But the others had said I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand Why Because they're burning the city and killing the There isn't an Armenian Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand So we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for On the way the driver says In fact there aren't any Armenians 'They burned them all beat them all and stabbed Well I was The whole way odd miles I was The driver asks me How old are you old man He wants to know if I'm being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means I'm an How old are you he asks I say I'm I'm too but I call you 'old man' I say It depends on God each person's life in this world is I look much older than my years that's why he called me old Well after that he was silent We're approaching the city I look and see tanks all around and a Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his Well he was waving his hand we all start waving our I'm sitting there with them I start waving my hand I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with I look at the city there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there's no Well probably I was They stopped our People were standing on the They have armature shafts and stones And they stopped us Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's The Armenians usually For example I'm an Armenian but I speak their language very Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually The pronunciations are Anyone who says pundukh even if they're not Armenian they immediately take out and start to Another one says There was a car there with five people inside it he They started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on And they didn't let the people out he says they wouldn't let them get out of the I only saw the car but the driver says that he saw Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back When they stop us we all get out of the I look and there's a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by We're Azerbaijani ' they tell him 'no Armenians He did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says Maybe you're an Armenian old man But in Azerbaijani I say You should be ashamed of yourself And he Turned and That was all that What was I to do I had to the city was on fire but I had to steal my children out of my own They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street that's where the Kavkaz store and three large story buildings That's the beginning of down I saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal I couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Later I was told it was a And the people in there were completely Nothing remained of them not even any That driver had told me about it and I saw the car The car was The skeleton a metallic About to yards from the Kavkaz I see a military transport an armored personnel The hatches are And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd And I hear shots not automatic fire it's true but pistol Several There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel Someone in the crowd was Apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or At that point there was only one armored personnel And all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off I walked I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the I can tell by their gait that they're not bandits they're just people walking I joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly I tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer Well so I walked into Microdistrict which is across from our I can't get into our block but I walked where there were fewer people so as to get Well there I see a tall guy and to people are walking behind And he's shouting into a megaphone Comrades the Armenian Azerbaijani war has begun The police have megaphones like So they're talking and walking around the second I see that they're coming my way and turn off behind a I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about or people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the What they were doing I can't say because I couldn't get up close to them I was But the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not April Yerevan
