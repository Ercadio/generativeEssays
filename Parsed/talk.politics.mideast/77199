From Srinivas Sunder Subject Re The Stage is Being Set In article writes Srinivas Suder writes If the Haitian people's will is that their current get thrown out they'll find a way to do Getting the US UN to short cut the process will only hasten it but sets a bad precedent can the US interfere EVERYWHERE Why not right at our doorstep Cuba Precisely why not Cuba Why not The Hatians are being ruled by thugs and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples Well let's delve one level Why is democracy better than tribalism or other means of The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping majority and booted out later w no objections from the Similarly the people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the junta declared it In both cases I personally have no problems with the outcome but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the world community claims to revere so why isn't it interfering there the or any other democracy wishes to they are in the perfect right to help them without any whining from thir After all if it turns out to be colonialism and the poeple don't like it they' find a way to throw them out My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way and we can save ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their problems on their Colonial interventions even in Haiti haven't worked in the They had a coups from The US invaded in And left in almost years after they had intended Was it a success Well look at Haiti today and of the past years and decide for It was a success so long as the US was in from what I But it didn't last long There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit in judgement of another people and to then act on To me it is in there that the roots of old colonial attitudes Today the motives are Tomorrow they may not Who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide Nobody People should have a right to self If the UN wants to arm the Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever I have no problems with I do when they cross that line and attempt to re arrange boundaries the Vance Owen plan being one such piece of I want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide while you want special sovereignties designed to protect Nobody has the right to commit crimes against humanity and if they do they loose all right to self If this is classical colonialism then so be We finally have a clearly stated point of Colonialism can have its good side which is as you stated above removing thugs from being able to lord it over powerless I am worried that the bad side is what will assert itself and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of Srinivas Sunder If The University of Illinois shares these views I'd be They aren't that smart generally
