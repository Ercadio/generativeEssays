i didn't realize that one can use katyushas while onr is disarmed.
also, page 8 of today's new york times, faisal saleh, a high ranking fatah official, and his 9 month old son were gunned down in beirut by members of abu nidal. there have been 46 assasination attempts in 1993 alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in
11 deaths. amir
