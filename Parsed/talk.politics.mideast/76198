From Tim Clock Subject Re Israeli Terrorism In article Andi Beyer writes I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering reported accurately on what was happening in It is interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's political agenda whether it is on or against our side Tim Tim Clock Graduate student UCI tel Department of Politics and Society fax University of California Irvine Home tel Irvine CA
