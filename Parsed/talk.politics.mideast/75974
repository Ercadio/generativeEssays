From Adam Shostack Subject Re Israeli Expansion lust In article writes In article Adam Shostack writes In article writes IMHO it does not really matter who started any individual battle within the Arabs Isreal war The real question is who what started the Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab land Huh A war was started when several armies invaded Israel vowing to drive the Jews into the Most Jews wanted to live in peace and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted I am surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive If the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is It is not a hostile action leading to As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of the Living in peace is meaningless unless it means living WITH someone else as For a native arab this does not leave many Oh you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens The arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective If I were wrong you'd have Israel recall all the palestinian refugees we're talking millions After all they are Huh The people who left did so There is no reason for Israel to let them Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing Israel got no western aid in nor in or still granted citizenship to those arabs who And how is granting citizenship a facade Tell me something What makes land arab How shall I explain Its a contract between the man and the Control isn't The Ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a The concept of Land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic It is partly the concept of 'le sol natal' native I know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent I'm talking everyday life not Try again you tell me what its isn't but you fail to establish what it Also Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from or so Does that make the land Jewish Adam Adam Shostack If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldn't waste them on members of John Perry Barlow
