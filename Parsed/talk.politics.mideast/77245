From Josip Loncaric Subject Re Europe Muslim Bosnians In article writes I like what Joseph Biden had to say yesterday in the Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans and calling that moral rape He went on to say that the reason for that is out right religious BIGOTRY Parts of Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today Let me put it plainly You are required to speak diplomatically I am I cannot even begin to express to you my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference timidity self delusion and After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia they are asking us to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe havens' for the Let's not mince European policy is based on cultural and religious indifference if not And I think it's fair to say that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims were doing what the Serbs have done if this was Muslim aggression instead of Serbian Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world the consequences of which we cannot begin to Later Biden told a reporter why he spoke out I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear this is a big so they will and it IS a big By refusing the fundamental human right of self defense to Bosnia Herzegovina Europe and the world have aided the Serbian Moreover the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims Under such conditions it is very easy for Serbs to play a divide and conquer game and to get the Muslims and Croats who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression to start fighting each other which leads to their mutual One final quote Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said in Rome last week that In practice the embargo had the opposite effect It made aggression All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this Sincerely Josip
