From Shai Guday Subject Re was Go Hezbollah In article Basil Hamdan writes snip In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol is not That having been said lets snip imagine It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist camps There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the SOME young men usually aged between to years are members of the Lebanese Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent Once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an year old girl just happened to Some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you Not all There are a large number of groups in the area backed by various organizations with a wide range of Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still As to retaliation while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing which would have produced major Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to Well here we I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted Actually that is not clear at I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of No the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese I could elaborate if I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder no matter what you No but it is regretable as is the whole Shai Guday Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer Thinking Machines the winged ninjas of the Cambridge MA
