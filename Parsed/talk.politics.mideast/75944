check it at her his library if not I can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct I really don't care what year it was first published or What I care about is what the book writes about murders tortures the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these your groundless accussations DD I can provide postings if required to verify my claim VD what is new I will post a file but I am not going go through the effort to show there is some Turkish modified re publication of the book like last time I claim I have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in Serdar Argic's Reference couldn't reject now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting Let's see how you lie from 'non existing' quotes to re publication First you said there was no such a quote in the given called Serdar Argic a liar I said to you NO there exactly existed such a I even gave the call number page could't reject And now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim am sure that you have

by saying it is not not what is your point Differences in the number of pages Mine was published in Argic's was in No need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc does it give you an idea The issue was not the number of pages the book the year first And you tried to hide the whole the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by those quotes given by Serdar Argic exist It was the issue wasn't it you were not able to object it bother you anyway You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still has so many craps in the Any question Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of ' Ohanus Appressian 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish ' Sahak Melkonian
