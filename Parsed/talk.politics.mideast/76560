From Edward A Shnekendorf Subject Re Deir Yassin Get thee to a writes First of all Harry I am not so uninformed about Irgun's TERRORIST I'll give you a few quotes from a book by Charles Smith in his Palestine and the Arab Israeli Conflict Ah Palestine and the Arab Israeli Sounds Begin directed the Irgun to bomb only civilian that's right CIVILIAN installations linked to the mandatory authority not military This is I supposed Charles Smith characterizes the bombing of the King David Hotel as a civilian installation Any installation attacked by Etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the Mandatory and of course there is the LEHI splinter group which included such notable Israelis as Yitzak the LEHI fighters for the freedom of Israel resumed its assassinations of British officials CIVILIAN and military What kind of CIVILIANS I assume Charles Smith means completely innocent people who were intentionally targeted right Please provide and there is of course Dair Yassin where men woman and children were killed perhaps I'm sure for strategic reasons yet what ever happened to the non aggression pact with the Hagana I have references for that if you'd It seems to me like blatant scare tactics that Begin himself admits to having been very useful in scaring off the Palestinian i do have references The Revolt los angeles Nice In The Revolt Begin does state that the myth of a massacre at Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into However nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy of the Thus if it did happen it was not so I think Arab calls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had a greater effecton Arab migration than Deir In fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed all in all to scare off Arabs by may Nice use of I like Very Actually according to many sources including American diplomatic officials the greatest encouragment for Arabs to leave their villages came from Arab This certainly might be all a matter of semantics You might say that the Hagana did this for but like I said before how do we not know that the Palestinian conflict isn't equatable with a war If Israel never got her state the Hagana's activities would be lost in history categorized as tewrrorism for sure because it could not be identified with the cause of a I do take this seriously I sincerely think the Palestinians are being discriminated against in this case because perhaps everyone thinks their cause is just some stuff to ponder Over and Ramiro
