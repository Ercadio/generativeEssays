without any Of course you paid the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far Your aggressions thru Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you I am not saying that conflicts started with It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always It is sad that we both still are not trying to I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to I thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept miles of territorial waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake sorry What compromise are you talking about on That is not Greece business to join the island to That is up to people in the island to live or not to live They made their decision and they are living separetely is a peace Greeks can't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is Your dream will never come mile territorialwater Are you joking or dreaming We can declare our miles territorial water which can come close to How would you like it If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream mile territorial waters We do not have any city called We

talk to me are educated They have never met me but they know I am bad person because I am from Politics is not my business and it is not the business of most of the When it comes to individuals why the hatred Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a bad It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you bad People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own Millions of minorities are being

Turkish The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in They are being trained in special camps in They are taught how to kill innocent women and not a claim this is a fact known by whole In conlusion you are in action to murder rape destroy the innocent I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about
