From Bob Blackshaw Subject Re Mosque in Jewish quarter was Re Israeli destruction I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it Will Durant but I am beginning to believe the opposite is Here in and in other newsgroups it seems that history is mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a In the history of my own people there are ample acts of shame both done by my people and done to my Since I was not party to any of those acts I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my ancestors committed nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants of those who committed evil acts against my Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque Will it rebuild the Temple Somehow I doubt that it A post in another group on the Bosnian war asked us all to love each other that love would conquer Sadly I remember a TV interview with a young woman in Sarajevo sp who was as I remember a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle She was now trying to pick off Serbian During the communist years she had married a Serb who was now fighting against her So it seems that hate will conquer Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together It's a damn small planet which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball glowing softly in We seem to have been spared that prospect shall we now bathe it in each other's blood Shalom Salam and Peace REB
