From Andi Beyer Subject Re Israeli Terrorism writes Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's political agenda whether it is on or against our side Tim First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and not Goering Airforce who ran the Nazi propaganda I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts the Americans are I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human However the US has vetoed most such It is interesting to note that the is often the only country opposing such condemnation well the and Israel It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights So maybe there are human rights violations going on after
