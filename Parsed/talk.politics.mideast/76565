From Sessions Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza In Center for Political Reflux wrote pseudo letterhead deleted dcs While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Why do I detect the faint scent of bias here Could it be because the Israelis aren't feasting Perhaps because the Gazans aren't starving The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world Oh I hadn't realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong Kong or that Singapore had sunk into the sea or that several other cities had Either that or this is a taste of the quality of 'Research' we're about to has been cut off from the world for So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style Or is this another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza some people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Hey You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same 'right' Come to think of it Mexico is denying me that 'right' evan as I write this Or are you ever so gently suggesting that Israel unlike every other country on Earth shouldn't be allowed to control traffic across its borders While Polish non Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian This sounds like a parallel but it isn' Tell us how many Poles went into the Ghetto to join the Jews Oops For a moment there I forgot that in Poland 'humanitarian assistance could get you Come to think of it humanitarian assistance to the Gazans can get Israelis killed Except that in Gaza it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own So let's keep the Since the gross numbers aren't the same we'll need a proportionality Should we use Gazan vs Jewish initial population Gazan vs Jewish death rates Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance' Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims Since the two cases are so comparable it shouldn't matter which we pick they'll all be about the same right Contrary to popular hyperbole the IDF could quite easily kill off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted No I'm not And I really don't want to discuss Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline space than a dozen and are just as soon forgotten and once exterminated they can't keep popping up as So if a Final Solution for Gaza would be so much better from a Realpolitik standpoint why doesn't Israel go for it A difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything good about Jews and probably why they keep trying to force fit the facts into the Sessions Speaking for myself Note new network address Author and everything else of TMail DOS mail news shell
