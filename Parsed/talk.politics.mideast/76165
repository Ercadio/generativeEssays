>basil what is the point in throwing out one-sided viewpoints (which means:
ignoring that the "other side's" perspective and experience has any legitimacy) while assuming that "your side" possesses no faults and bears no responbility for any of the negative impacts of a particular event? isn't the former onesided? isn't the latter naive? if you feel that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how. "strategic withdrawal" under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this
net but doesn't accomplish anything.
