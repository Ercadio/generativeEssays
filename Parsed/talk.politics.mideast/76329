From Adam Shostack Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza In article Center for Policy Research writes Other people have commented on most of this swill I figured I'd add a few comments of my The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for Hong Kong and Cairo both have higher population The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza some people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in There is no fundamental right to work in another And the closing of the strip is not a punishment it is a security measure to stop people from stabbing The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian Dozens minus one since one of them was stabbed to death a few days Adam Adam Shostack If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldn't waste them on members of John Perry Barlow
