From feigenbaum benjamin Subject Re was Go Hezbollah In article Brad Hernlem writes In article Dorin Baru writes Brad Hernlem writes Well you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the retaliatory shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli backed My team you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands so to I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in Lebanon and try to see through the There are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in retaliation to pin point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the Lebanese If the attack was justified or not is at least But this is not the The issue is that you were cheering Dorin Dorin of all the criticism of my post expressed on this one I I regret that aspect of my It is my hope that the occupation will end and the accompanying loss of life but I believe that stiff resistance can help to achieve that Despite what some have said on I think that there is a point when losses are The strategy drove troops out of Lebanon at Brad Hernlem Hi Brad I have two comments Regarding your hope that the occupation will belive that stiff how about an untried approach peace and I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis Hopefully violence against Arabs would stop at the same If a state of non violence could be maintained perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the territories Of course given the current leadership of Israel your way may work also but if that leadership changes to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality then I would predict a considerable loss of life no Secondly regarding your comment about the troops responding to stiff resistance the analogy is not quite The troops could get out of the neighborhood The Israelis could Just my worth no offense Respectfully
