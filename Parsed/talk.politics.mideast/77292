From Mash Javad Subject Re Europe Muslim Bosnians In article Gerald Olchowy writes The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if Clinton starts bombing but Clinton doesn't have the courage to ask that the blue berets leave because then he becomes primarily responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it wants to feel free to use American military power for the sake of domestic US politics and his domestic image but he doesn't want to assume the primary international leadership role in the UN and among the allies like Bush for all his faults did in the Gulf because with leadership comes responsibility and Clinton seems to want to retain the Europeans as This is one of the most ridiculous arguments I have heard from the Let's let the Serbs massacre rape and ethnically clean Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there to get scratched Well I say get them the hell out of there if you're worried for them but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self defense Lift the embargo against Bosnia and let them defend What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people They are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive when if anything it should be the other way Idiots like Owen expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan and just hope this problem will go Well they're If they had got their butts in gear that is if Bosnia had oil a year ago much of this could be Now however the results of this tragedy will last for That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Yeah This as senator Biden said reeks of bigotry and makes me and any decent human being for that matter quite It should be the Europeans not the Americans who take the inititiative and ask the other for This is their backyard not the Today it's Bosnia tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia Greece and then Turkey and the damn thing will Not to mention European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to Good luck handling that your majesty Owen was upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain who hoped to appease He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich years before any war I have been here during a blazing war for the last Well that makes him even worse because Chamberlain could have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt whereas Owen can't even do What the west is doing is aiding the Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands and making the stupid excuse of their powerless troops on the ground who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign minister in their own armored vehicle and watch the killers just walk away What kind of peace is this What kind of civilization is this Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible but wants to freelance on the if his freelancing gets too hot he wants to be able to cut and American public may be easily leaders aren' European leaders are PATHETIC and are helping a genocide which even they will not be able to Yeah they'll go to Africa and fight for some damn dictator in their former colony they'll go to Kuwait and fight for oil but in Bosnia not only they won't fight aggression they'll even tie the hands of the Now you tell me who is fooling Gerald Mash Javad
