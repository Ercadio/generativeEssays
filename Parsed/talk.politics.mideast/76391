Karabakh Part A of Oh yes I just While they were raping me they repeated quite frequently Let the Armenian women have babies for us Muslim babies let them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Then they said Those Muslims can carry on our holy Heroes They repeated it very DEPOSITION OF LYUDMILA GRIGOREVNA Born Teacher Sumgait Secondary School Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office Resident at Building Apartment Microdistrict Sumgait Azerbaijan Note The events in Kafan used as a pretext to attack Armenians in Azerbaijan are false as verified by independent International Human Rights organizations DD I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates the price was too great Now after the Sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into before and '' We talk like that that was before the Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch a No matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be On the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now They say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that Nineteen eighty eight was a leap Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian those who lost someone and those who didn' That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible so we didn't take any steps to save At least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the My parents themselves are not that old and But then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save In our apartment the tragedy started on February around five in the I call it a tragedy and I repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among Armenians among people who wish me only well I feel like it's all starting over I remember how that mob broke into our apartment My parents were standing in the My father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the Our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped We're known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis Jews or We had friends of many nationalities even a Turkmen My parents were in the hall my father with an I remember him telling my mother Run to the kitchen for a But Mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit To be honest I never expected it of her she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the A girlfriend was at the house that day a Russian girl Lyuda and Mamma said No matter what happens no matter what they do to us you're not to come out of the We're going to tell them that we're alone in the We went into the There were four of Marina and the Russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one The idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions I wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last And maybe Karina was thinking the same thing but she's quite We didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a There was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the I ran after her I had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save Marina and her The mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from At first about people burst in but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't They came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other He didn't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but Mamma snatched the axe from behind and said Tell them not to touch the Tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the She said this to Father in There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke They understood Armenian The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian they don't need to speak And one of them responded in Armenian You and your children both we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you Armenians did in They killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at They were mostly young people under At first there weren't any older people among And all of their faces were Sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me I'm a So they dragged my father into the other They twisted his arms and took him in there no they didn't take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to They closed the door to that room all but a We couldn't see what was happening to Father what they were doing to Then a young man about years old started to tear off Mamma's sarafan and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani I'm old enough to be your mother What are you doing He struck Now he's being held Mamma identified I hope he's Then they went after Karina who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their She told them that what they were doing was wrong that they mustn't do She said Come on let's straighten this out without What do you want Who are you Why did you come here What did we ever do to you Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the back more of them kept coming and coming said What are you talking to them You should kill We came here to kill They pushed Karina struck her and she fell They beat her but she didn't cry Even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating What did we do to you What did we do to you And even later when she came to she said Mamma what did we do to them Why did they do that to us That group was prepared I know this because I noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with I remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off I felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to All I could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to That's why I felt no Later when they carried Karina off they beat her savagely It's really amazing that she not only lived but didn't lose her mind She is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her Mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could Mamma Karina and I were all in one And again I didn't feel any pain just didn't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more Then someone suggested Let's take her Those beasts were in They did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the Those were their true At the time I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma her face was completely covered with blood that's when I started to feel the I blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though I were recording it all on I think I'm a kind person by nature but I'm vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and I don't deserve I hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me And every time I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me I'd remember them and I'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that I hurt all over I had been beaten terribly I found the strength in myself to interfere with their I realized that I had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an I pushed one of them away he was a real I remember now that he's being held As though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the I had long hair and it was stuck all over One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands I was up in the As though for the last time I took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside I suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my And suddenly I felt myself I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I just imagined When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was still lying on the And since I didn't scream didn't beg them at all they became all the more wild like They started to trample me with their Shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe cially put them Then I lost I came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched Some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment I didn't need any of those I was sure that none of us would survive and I had even forgotten about Marina and if none of us was alive it wasn't worth There was a moment when the pain was especially I withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because I had showed myself to be so I started to strangle myself and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my The person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well because he was the oldest in the He looked around I know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a Something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized although of course he knew that I'd never forgive Something like that I can never I have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds I have always put myself in the other person's shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me I shall never forget I wanted to do myself in then because I had nothing to lose because no one could protect My father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer And Ira Melkumian my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times her brother tried to save her and couldn't so he tried to kill her his very own He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited I don't know which one it was Edik or Both of them were in the room from which the axe was But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in I heard about it all from the neighbor from the Melkumians' His name is Makhaddin he knows my family a He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku how we were feeling and if we needed He's a good He said You should praise God that you all But what I saw with my own eyes I a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life I he says nearly lost my mind that I had never seen the likes of it and think I never shall The door to his apartment was open and he saw One of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the Igor Edik and Ira He saw Ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven He told us about it and said he would never forget He heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do But all the same they tried to do The guy who got hit with the axe I I After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and Lyuda out of the I was in such a state that I couldn't even remember my sister's I wanted to cry Marina out to her but could I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she And thus I saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance that they weren't Lyuda's a Russian you can tell right away and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an And I almost gave her away and doomed I'm glad that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health although her spirit was murdered At some point I came to and saw Igor Igor Agayev my acquaintance in that He lives in the neighboring For some reason I remembered his name maybe I sensed my defense in I called out to him in Russian Igor help But he turned away and went into the Just then they were taking Marina and Lyuda out of the Igor said he knew Marina and Lyuda that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani and he took both of them to the And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save Then they were striking me very hard we have an Indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the They were already sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new Someone said She's already dead let's throw her When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when I was about to die the second time I heard someone say in Azerbaijani Don't kill her I know her she's a I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but I can't remember whose voice it It wasn't Igor because he speaks Azerbaijani with an accent his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and I having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out I had been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember I only remember that this person was older and he had a high Unfortunately I can't remember anything What should I say about Igor He didn't treat me I had heard a lot about him that he wasn't that good a person that he sometimes drank too Once he boasted to me that he had served in He knew that women usually like bravery in a Especially if a man was in Afghanistan if he was wounded then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with Later I found out that he had served in Ufa and was injured but that's not in Afghanistan of I found that all out Among the people who were in our apartment my Karina also saw the Secretary of the Party I don't know his last name his first name is Najaf he is an Armenian born But later Karina wasn't so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she didn't want to endanger She said He was there and a little while later Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone No it seems like it was I am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely The investigators haven't summoned him He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the He brought groceries and flowers this was right before March he almost started crying he was so upset to see our I don't know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the Procuracy he said that he had been in Baku he wasn't in The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our I don't know how the investigators are now treating At one point I wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our Couldn't he have gone to Baku and arranged an alibi I'm not ruling out that Ill now return to our Mamma had come You could say that she bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were She bought her own and her husband's lives with She gave the gold to a year old Vadim A Russian boy he speaks Azerbaijani He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami He goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped But I'll say this I'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion that boy is not at all mentally He's healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policemen should be so And he's cunning After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo He beat Mamma and demanded gold saying Lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we'll let you And Mamma told them where the gold He brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one I'm surprised they didn't kill one another right Mamma was still in control of She had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other Father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his There was a broken table on top of the pil Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other He couldn't comprehend anything couldn't see and was covered with black and Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth I think it was a slipcover from an The bandits were still in our apartment even in the room Mamma pulled Father out of led him out of carried him out We had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a Three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service Mamma saw them out of the corner of her She said I was afraid to turn around I just seized Father and started pulling him but at the threshold I couldn't hold him up he fell down and I picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors' Mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face half turned toward her out of one She says I realized that my death would come from that I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went Later they caught that Meanwhile Mamma grabbed Father and I was Igor had taken Marina away Mamma and Father were gone Karina was already outside I didn't know what they were doing to I was left all alone and at that moment I became someone else do you understand Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me all the same I somehow managed to hold I went on fighting them I bit someone I remember and I scratched But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were the ones I had observed the ones who beat Karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that I was about to die and that all of that would die with At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next I didn't know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same When I saw him I said Neighbor is that you In so doing I placed myself in great He realized that if I lived I would remember That's when he grabbed the The axe that had been taken from my I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my When he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in the Everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a Everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or He said Enough let's go to the third In the third entryway they killed Uncle Shurik Aleksandr This confirms once again that they had prepared in Almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the Four people remained in the room soldiers who didn't obey their They had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those to hours but I had never seen those One of them Kuliyev I identified him later a native of the Sisian District of Armenia an Azerbaijani had moved to Azerbaijan a year He told me in Armenian Sister don't be afraid I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of That's just what he said those Azerbaijanis as though he himself were not Azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred I'll drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because they'll be coming back from Apartment That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment Before that the person in the Eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the general said that they were going to the third Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldn't do it by Marina's old fur coat was lying on the He threw it over my shoulders I was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door But the door was lying on the floor in the I went out onto the There were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the It was impossible to find He told me Well fine I won't leave you Would any of the neighbors let you in They'll be back they won't calm down they know you're He told me all this in Then he returned to the others and said What are you waiting for Leave They said Ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her No we want to do it He urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be He led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said What's the mat ter aren't you men Go fight with the What do you want of her And he came back They wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn't hold them off Then he asked me where he could hide I told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor Apartment we were on really good terms with We knocked on the door and he explained in The neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said I'm an He said I Let her sit at your place a Don't open the door to anyone no one knows about this I won't tell Let her stay at your She says Fine have her come I went She cried a bit and gave me some stockings I had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous I burst into Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat it's a short one a half length I was cold all the I asked Do you know where my family is what happened to them She says No I don't know I'm afraid to go out of the apartment now they're so wild that they don't look to see who's Azerbaijani and who's Kuliyev Ten minutes later my neighbor says You know Lyuda I don't want to lose my life because of you or my son and his Go stay with someone During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouth I had pearl earrings on and ripped it out tearing the The other earring was still When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly and then when I touched my ear I noticed that I had one earring I took it out and gave it to She took the earring but she led me out of the I went out and didn't know where to I heard someone going I don't know who it was but assumed it was With tremendous difficulty I end up to our apartment I wanted to die in my own I go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth I had to do I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was Instead of hiding I squatted near some broken Christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started Then they came Someone said that there were still some things to I think that someone pushed me under the I lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and I got all cut up but I lay there without My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear There were no lights Maybe that's what saved They were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a They started picking out the clothes that could still be They took Father's sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my They pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair I almost cried And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive and I started to strangle myself I took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that I would die and they would only find me They were throwing the burned matches under the bed and I got burned but I withstood Something inside of me held on someone's hand was protecting me to the I knew that I was going to die but I didn't know I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment but if I found out that one of my family had died I would die for sure because I had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your Marina I thought was still alive she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be He served in Afghanistan he should protect While I was strangling myself I said my good byes to And then I thought how could Marina survive If they killed all of us how would she live all by herself There were six people in the They talked among themselves and One talked about his daughter saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his Another said that he liked the apartment recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up and that he would live there after everything was all They started to A third one says How come you get it I have four children and there are three rooms here that's just what I All these years I've been living in God awful Another one says Neither of you gets We'll set fire to it and Then someone said that Azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their And they to my good fortune didn't set fire to the apartment and Oh yes I just While they were raping me they repeated quite frequently Let the Armenian women have babies for us Muslim babies let them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Then they said Those Muslims can carry on our holy Heroes They repeated it very reference for The Sumgait Tragedy Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan Volume I Eyewitness Accounts edited by Samuel
