Stavroulakis 'Athens Auschwitz' page Source Professor Stanford Shaw 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic ' New York University Press New York page disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on for a century was disastrous for Ottoman This was the age of nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan starting with the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on the Megali Idea or Great Idea sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul and large portions of Anatolia union of which with Greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all' The success of the Greek national movement provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the efforts of the Greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed not so much by the Ottomans but rather by the Greek religious hierarchy which dominated the Orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious independence granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in to the Serbian Church in and to the Rumanian Church in with subsequent aspirations for and achievement of political independence page new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian missionaries who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of Christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the Vicious anti Muslim and anti Semitic movements developed involving large scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies by the independent states that resulted also by Christian subjects who remained within the Empire particularly because of Jewish and Muslim support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of Southeastern The results were explosive and The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting nationalists and later successfully established independent Christian states committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout the nineteenth century despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of Paris and Berlin page the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the ever shrinking boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead as united Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth In the ruler of Moldavia Peter the Lame banished its Jews because of their competition with its Christian When Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in he ordered the massacre of all the Jews as well as Turks in page The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth When the Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through Moldavia and Wallachia toward page second paragraph When Venice occupied the island of Chios in its Jewish population was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native Greek population leaving those Jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging no longer able to compete with the Greeks in trade or page third paragraph Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for Ottoman When the Greek nationalist movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia during the spring of hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs During the height of the Greek revolution five thousand Jews were massacred in Morea along with most of the Muslim population numbering about twenty thousand in all In Tripolizza alone Jews were massacred along with uncounted Turks Reverend John Hartley after describing the carnage concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood mingled with Turkish flow down the streets of captured The sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael on this as well as on every occasion during the Greek Revolution met with common Their corpses were cast out of the city and like the ancient sovereign of Judah they received no burial superior to that of an ' Jewish communities on the islands of Sparta Patras Corinthos Mistra and Argos were wiped out by bands of Greek rebels along with those of Thebes Vrachori Attica and Epirus The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu where Jews who had fled from Italy and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century though divided into rival Greek and Italian It was not long however before it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution leading to savage repression and massacres of Jews forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self defense for the first Throughout the years of Greek revolution Greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the Agean exterminating all the Jews and Muslims they could find many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Contemporary accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards Most of the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats to Izmir thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman Jewish life during the nineteenth Only in Northern Greece particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica were the Jews and the Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults thus saving their populations from massacre as well During the remainder of the century particularly during the Greek Turkish war in those Jews who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens Chalkis Larissa Corfu and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre forcing thousands more to emigrate into Ottoman territory particularly to Salonica and Izmir page last paragraph The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe stimulated more popular anti Semitic and anti Muslim hysteria in all the countries involved with blood libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers merchants and professionals a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Because the Bulgarians Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the Turks both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal Their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation while the survivors fled in desperation to Edirne and While official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth page last paragraph Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern In the Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations Many of those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of the Banque In and and again in and thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in Russia which went on between and with only slight periods of In Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from persecution in Vidin in independent The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian forces during the Balkan Wars including Salonica Corlu and Edirne was followed by general attacks on Jews their synagogues homes and shops in both countries resulting in a renewed exodus toward Istanbul and Two reports from Salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies 'All the self interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth can never
