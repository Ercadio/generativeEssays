From Adam Shostack Subject Re Legality of the Jewish Purchase In article writes Adam Shostack writes Sam Zbib writes I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive If the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of Israel right after it was Israeli The ethnic composition depends on what you mean by What the UN deeded to Israel What it won in war And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is It is not a hostile action leading to No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and Palestinians are no Perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business Were there anti trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine Since the answer is no you're argument while interestingly constructed is I will however respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti trust They were establishing a bridgehead for the European And those fleeing Arab lands where Jews were second class Plus they paid fair market value Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they They did not know they were victims of an international You know Sam when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy its really begins to sound like anti Semitic The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite Zionists made no bones about what was going There were conferences publications etc all talking about creating a National home for the Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing Israel got no western aid in nor in or still granted citizenship to those arabs who And how is granting citizenship a facade Don't get me I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group Jews 'bad' Personaly I've never heard anything about the arab community in Except that they're So yes they're But as a community with history and roots its Because you've never heard of it its dead The fact is you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of non existant International Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the unexplained constraints of one ethnic The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they So please tell me Sam what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab Does that mean that they have no history or roots When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel one of my neighbors was an Israeli He wasn't really all that different from my other Does that make him dead or oppressed I stand I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly So what to make of the rest Palestine How recent is recent I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza It would be pretty silly but I could do I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish but that land has no Adam Adam Shostack If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldn't waste them on members of John Perry Barlow
