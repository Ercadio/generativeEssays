From Harry Mamaysky Subject Re Deir Yassin In article aurag Aurag Hassan writes Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin or in Sabra and Shatila If so then let me tell you some good jokes There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any People die that is No one gets Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in may be thought it was like snifing No What do you think of this Isn't it stupid to say so Well it is as stupid as what you said time you want to lie do it Sincerely Hassan Arab civilians did die at Dir But there was no First of all the village housed many armed Secondly the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing The village was attacked only for its military In fact a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to By all rational standards Dir Yassin was not a The killing was The village housed Arab snipers and Arab Thus it was attacked for its military It was not attacked with intentions of killing any To even compare Dir Yassin in which some or so Arabs died to the Holocaust is The Irgun did not want to kill any The village had almost inhabitants most of whom
