From Jay Morris Subject Re Europe vs Muslim Bosnians In article M Gerald Olchowy writes In article C x y xD cbfsb cb att com mohamed s sadek writes I like what Mr Joseph Biden had to say yesterday in the senate Condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans and calling that moral rape It is easy for Sen Biden to say that when there are no US troops in Zepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo this is true The existing UN policy may certaining be wrong, but the US wants to dictate policy, and make Europe responsible for the consequences of that policy this has merit but is not entirely true Bosnia is a big enough problem for the US to preach about what other countries should be doing with their forces but its forces are safely tucked away at home in the US Gerald this last statement is not true According to the CBO the United States has a force of about , US Army personel in Europe, I do not know if this includes a USMC division in Norway They have available a little more than USAF attack aircraft, including various models of the F , A , F A B, and a few F s there are about , more of these available, SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME At one time, the US maintained MBTs about half were M A but some of these were relocated to the Persian Gulf I know the US has at LEAST one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade Does anyone know if there are any B B Bs in England The point is, although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia, it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped outside of St Louis I also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in Macedonia Any reaction out there to this Question day before yesterday I heard that Serbia Montenegro had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina sp verified that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia A Serbian who happened to be muslim , stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station Now everyone is stopped and searched, many are turned back Of course all I heard was a translators version, I do not speak Serbo Croatian If this is a effort on the part of Serbia Montenegro for whatever reason to push the Boserbs into accepting the V O, is this not a good thing Peace, Jay Morris
