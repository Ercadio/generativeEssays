From Sam Zbib Subject Legality of the Jewish Purchase was Re Israeli Expansion lust Adam Shostack writes Sam Zbib writes I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive If the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of Israel right after it was And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is It is not a hostile action leading to No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and Palestinians are no Perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such Basic ANTI TRUST law says that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori Clearly the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real They were establishing a bridgehead for the European The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab Being a multi ethnic multi religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another Plus they paid fair market value They did not know they were victims of an international I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of the Living in peace is meaningless unless it means living WITH someone else as For a native arab this does not leave many Oh you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens The arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Again Adam the devil is in the I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return deportes and leave the Because is a nice number that you can devide by and besides it has an integer square Those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective If I were wrong you'd have Israel recall all the palestinian refugees we're talking millions After all they are Huh The people who left did so There is no reason for Israel to let them Do you actually believe this My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home in Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak I know none that agrees with Did you sample their opinions I know you don't care just being Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing Israel got no western aid in nor in or still granted citizenship to those arabs who And how is granting citizenship a facade Don't get me I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group Jews Israel probably had a few options after ethnic cleansing Serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' Personaly I've never heard anything about the arab community in Except that they're So yes they're But as a community with history and roots its Tell me something What makes land arab How shall I explain Its a contract between the man and the Control isn't The Ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a The concept of Land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic It is partly the concept of 'le sol natal' native I know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent I'm talking everyday life not Try again you tell me what its isn't but you fail to establish what it Also Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from or so Does that make the land Jewish I stand I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly So what to make of the rest Palestine Adam Shostack Sam Zbib Bell Northern Research Bitnet Internet VOICE FAX Surface Mail Stop Station C Ottawa Canada My opinions are my own and no one else's
