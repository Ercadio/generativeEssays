From Josip Loncaric Subject Re Europe Muslim Bosnians In article Michael Sells writes Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo Croat The annihilation of Islam Turks is an older Serbian But I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda in fact for the past century or two Croats and Muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly Your suggestion that Croat Muslim relationship is anything like Serb Muslim relationship is completely To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate The events of the past two years clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate in their alliance with Croats they maintained this Croats would have accepted a much closer relationship I This century plus of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at risk because of the inexorable logic of Since Bosnian Serbs of population have times more heavy weapons than Bosnian Muslims and Croats combined they have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only of the Muslims lost more territory than Croats who built defenses early on Under these conditions any alliance is bound to fall apart since it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the arms Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading the Europeans to go along with this this hope was Having no prospect of outside help the former allies turned on each other like two starved animals in a tight This inexorable logic of course got plenty of help from Serbian intelligence operatives who were doing everything to build mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a A timely intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented Sadly nothing was done to create a balance of power on the As long as the Serbs enjoy advantage they can break any alliance even among This is tragic but hardly new divide et impera was used by ancient Romans with In my view Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May when the hope of reversal of fortunes was I have a question for the distinguished diplomats do they believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder I'd like to know what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which solidified Serbian advantage in heavy weapons how did they expect to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces and how on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict but I am filled with Sincerely Josip
