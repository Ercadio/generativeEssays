DEPOSITION OF YURI VAGARSHAKOVICH MUSAELIAN Born Line Electrician Sumgait Streetcar and Trolleybus Administration Resident at Building Apartment Block Narimanov Street Sumgait Azerbaijan I spent almost all of February doing The was a short day at work we worked until eleven or eleven thirty and left for I decided to go for a short I went to Primorsky I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about to people standing When I had walked another to yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind I turned my head toward the It was a light blue GAZ I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the A man and a woman get The man is expensively dressed in a suit and the woman has a raincoat She doesn't have anything on her head and her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavy set They're to years They get something out of the The people start to help I become curious just what are they pulling out of there When I got up close I heard them turn something I didn't see what it was but it was probably a tape They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around I ask What's going on Someone tells me Come Well they were Azerbaijanis I had asked in I hear appeals Brother Muslims our time has come and something else along that I didn't understand what it was all I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape But the circle drew in New people started coming from various directions five here seven And the comments started Right we should slaughter the Armenians and There's no need to be afraid all of Moscow is behind I even heard that All Moscow is behind Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no I quietly left and went Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh that there were demonstrations Well people were saying all kinds of things but I didn't have any idea what was really going My wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunt's house in I didn't say anything to my We sat and drank Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and I looked out the window and saw a The crowd is moving slowly like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move My wife asks what's going on out I say I don't I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all In the crowd people are shouting Down with the Armenians and Death to the Armenians I waited for the entire crowd to At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee then they turned and went against the traffic it's one way there down the Street of the Baku Commissars toward the streetcar I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Aside from the things they were shouting I was surprised that there were only young people in the And they were minors under draft My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but I was kind of uneasy and said No let's stay at home An hour went by or maybe an hour and a Well I wasn't keeping track of the time I can't say exactly how long it I look and see another crowd on Narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the Rossiya movie I put outside clothes on and went out There's noise an uproar outside and the crowd has There are more And whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more No I think something's wrong here this isn't any They would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the I followed I was thinking I'd just watch and Who knew where this was leading We came out on Lenin At the square the SK club is on one side and the City Party Committee is on the I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned There was some sort of a rally going I go closer and hear exclamations I heard both anti Armenian and anti Soviet We don't need perestroika we want to go on living like we have Now what did they mean by living like we have been The Azerbaijanis work like everyone But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of Speculation theft and cheating go on all the And not just in Azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but I've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them True I didn't hear them say kill them over the microphone I only heard beat them and drive them I stayed at the square a few minutes First one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and I think they were MVD Ministry of Internal Affairs or State Security There were also uniformed policemen there but I didn't see any of them try to pacify the New people kept coming up onto the Well I had finally decided that this could end badly This was no demonstration and I had to protect my I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a It was next to the City Party Committee on Narimanov Street it stood next to the tai lor's shop there a low truck and it had low wooden I see that some thing is being unloaded crates of some I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in They pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the City Party Committee but toward the SK And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people to They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two Two people one case of And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or It was When I passed next to that person he stood with his side to There was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near He has a package in his hand and he's pulling out anasha and handing it I have never smoked it Once I tried it for fun but I've seen a lot of people smoke it I've seen it many times and I know what it I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling more warlike I turned around and saw them Well I'll just keep on going like I am I When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the He's a young guy or years He was carrying a red flag which had Ermeni oryum written on it in Azerbaijani that means Death to Armenians That guy used to live off the same courtyard as I don't really know what his name is but I know his father very His father's name is Rafik he used to be a cook and then became head He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli His family as I said lived on the same courtyard as we Our building was on Narimanov Street and theirs was on the Street of the Baku Commissars their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the Now Rafik's little brother lives there and he Rafik I heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth In a word his son was carrying a flag that said Death to Armenians I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Well anyway I went My wife was I told her It's OK it'll pass they're young kids they've just gotten all whooped Naturally I didn't want her to get overly After a while a new surge of crowd went And this time they were breaking I could hear it breaking but I couldn't see Well I think here we go the machine's in They weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for I didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they weren't even trying although I'll say it again the police were there I saw And it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good True at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadership and I'm not afraid to say these words so many people died So many women were abused and how many abominations there were I couldn't imagine that under our much vaunted authorities and if I were to be specific I would say under the much touted authorities in our city of Sumgait I couldn't imagine that such things could take When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son Let's go We went to our neighbors the Grigorians on the fourth And in the evening when those crowds started going past again I went outside once I stopped at The Corner a place called that right next to the I look and see a crowd on the And there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectable looking men of around say years The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the And then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward the And not a soul went past those three as though it were off limits Well everything got all churned up there was more noise and the glass was flying We spent the night at the neighbors' My apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in On the way I saw someone hunched up I never found out who it was or what happened to There were to people standing near I got the bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see That was on the morning of February Everyone knows the May Yerevan reference The Sumgait
