GAMBARIAN Born Senior Engineer Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association Resident at Building Apartment Microdistrict Sumgait Azerbaijan What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy an awful tragedy for us the Armenian people and for all of A genocide of Armenians took place during And it was a great tragedy for me personally because I lost my father in those He was still Born in On that day February we were at Of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about But we didn't think we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldn't go into people's About five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the Kosmos movie theater in our We were sitting at home watching We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir This is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right That day there was a group of policeman with shields They threw rocks at those Then they moved off in the direction of our They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for Armenians to come out of the We switched off the As it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the That meant that it was an Azerbaijani We of course didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our Suddenly there's pounding on the We go to the door all four of us there were four of us in the Father Mother my younger brother Aleksandr and He was born in My father was a veteran of World War II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East he was a We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani What's going on What's happened They say Armenians get out of here We don't open the door we say If we have to leave we'll leave we'll leave They say No leave now get out of here Armenian dogs get out of here By now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge We hold them off as best we can my father and I on one side and my mother and brother on the We had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend They broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another half No neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole We held the They started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a When the door gave way they tore it off its hinges Sasha hit one of them with the The axe flew out of his They also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature One of them hit my father in the The pressure from the mob was When we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her My brother Sasha and I fought back of Sasha is quite strong and hot tempered he was the judo champion of We had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the bandits in the heads and in the eyes all that went But they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of The door fell down at an The mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue to finish us Father brought skewers and gave them to Sasha and me we flew at them when we saw Father bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was We just threw ourselves on them when we saw We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third We came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind We started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish Then a man an imposing man of about an Azerbaijani came When he was coming in Father fell down and Mother flew to him and started to cry I jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and We live on the fourth And no one I went into the It seemed to me that this man was the leader of the He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani What's with you woman why are you shouting What happened Why are you shouting like that She says What do you mean what happened You killed somebody My father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings Armenian and Azerbaijani he played for many Everyone knew Mother says The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that He says You don't need to shout stop And when they heard the voice of this man the to people who were in the other room opened the door and started running We chased after them but they ran That man left As we were later told downstairs one of them told the others I don't know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an We raced to Father and started to massage his heart but it was already too We asked the neighbors to call an The ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the Somewhere around midnight about policemen They informed us they were from They said We heard that a group was here at your place you have our They told us not to touch anything and Father lay in the So we stayed Each of us took a hammer and a We sat at Well we say if they descend on us again we'll defend Somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy They say Leave everything just how it is we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too but no one helped us take Father The morning came and the neighbors We wanted to take Father away We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one We called an ambulance and nobody Then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should We secured the door somehow or We left Father in the room and went up to the neighbor' The excesses began again in the The bandits came in several vehicles ZIL panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like a landing force near the center of Our building was located right A crowd Then they started fighting with the Then in Buildings and that's next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into Armenian apartments destroying property and The Armenians weren't at home they had managed to flee and hide And again they poured in the direction of our They were shouting that there were some Armenians left on the fourth floor meaning They're up there still up Let's go kill them They broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large We were hiding one floor Something heavy Sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably Father they had thrown Father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn I heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and I said No that's from some of the Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him The mob left somewhere around eight o' They smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from They were also Armenians they had left for another The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said Are you crazy Why are you hiding Armenians Don't you now they're checking all the apartments They could kill you and them And to us Come on leave this apartment We went down to the third floor to some other neighbors' At first the man didn't want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he We stayed there until eleven o'clock at We heard the sound of The neighbors said that it was armored personnel We went There was a light on in the room where we left In the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn They left only one The bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict where there had been a With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were Our salvation my mother's my brother's and mine was purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up Well we fought but we were only able to save We couldn't save We inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them But others came to take their We were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all over we got our It was a miracle we We were saved by a miracle and the And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us We went to ' pick up Father's We took it to the This was about two o'clock in the morning it was already March it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our When my brother and I carried Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured There were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned It was I suffered a tremendous There were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to There was a woman's corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman's It was something The morgue was guarded by the landing force The child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was There was a man there too several You couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful Now two and a half months have Every day I recall with horror what happened in the city of Every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people's sorrow and especially the I still want to say that years have passed since Soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in It will go down in I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the They even fought the Many soldiers were The mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on They weren't They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our I saw the clashes on February near the airline ticket office right across from our And that mob was fighting with the The inhabitants of some of the buildings also Azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass They weren't afraid of I say they were sure of their When we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office I called the police at number and said that they were robbing Armenian apartments and burning And they told me that they knew that they were being During those days no one from the police department came to anyone's No one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in So I think all of it was arranged in They even knew in which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived on which floors they had lists the You can tell that the operation was planned in Thanks of course to our troops to the country's leadership and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us thanks to the Russian people because the majority of the troops were Russians and the troops suffered losses I want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all Armenians and in the name of all Sumgait For coming in time and averting terrible things worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment because if they don't the tragedy the genocide could happen Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass The mobs were At present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been I think judging by the newspaper There were around people near our building alone that's how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such May Yerevan reference The Sumgait Tragedy Pogroms
