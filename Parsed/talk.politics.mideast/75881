was savagely raped in that They argued among themselves who would go DEPOSITION OF KARINE KARINA GRIGOREVNA Born Secretary Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building Apartment Microdistrict Sumgait Azerbaijan On the my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about yards The SK They were showing an Argentinian film The Before the film we noticed about to people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee but they were silent there's no conversation whatsoever and we couldn't figure out what was going That is we knew it was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn't We bought our There were or people in the This was a very small number for that large movie The film About minutes later they stopped the A crowd burst About They came up onto the Well mostly they were young people from to years They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to Armenian I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl Marina and I were sitting I told her to move over there were some Russian girls sitting So that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not It got quiet or girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it's only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis people of various But no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a They were silent looking at one another and gradually started to Some guy a really fat one says OK we've scared them enough let's They leave slowly It seemed to me that those people were not Either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone Then it was all over as though nothing had happened at The film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be We could barely sit to the So it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street that's the center of Lenin Street was packed just packed with young They were shouting something about Karabagh and something about We weren't especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway Public transportation wasn't Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all Everything was He stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a Well since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super serious had We went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop We didn't want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might We flagged down a cab but the driver didn't want to take We told him we live near the bus station and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard I said well OK So we got into the cab and managed to get Something incredible was happening at the bus There was a traffic Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Ka ra bagh they're not going to give up I go home and tell my family what's going on and there's immediate panic in the Mamma says what should we do Like the end had come they were going to come kill us that's it Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up Nothing that bad could Where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have Somehow we manage to calm Mamma And we went to But no one could Everyone made as though nothing had That was on In short the day went We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our No one did Because life goes That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldn't On the everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always There were five of us at home Mamma Papa and us three sisters Lyuda Marina and My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the We sat at home and no one went Later we learned that a demonstration had started that It all started They were smashing up We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda Zimogliad came by at around three o'clock I We worked together we did our apprenticeships together she's a Russian She said that something awful was happening in I asked Don't they want Armenians Well what are they after if they're already in that state She says no nothing like that it's just a demonstration but it's awful to watch Somehow it feels like a war has broken Public transportation has been stopped The cabs the buses well it's just a Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera asked him Where are you going Stop There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard aren't you afraid to go out Papa didn't know what she was talking She simply pushed him back into the He came home and told Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going But we didn't go see her she's a Russian she lives across from I had to see my friend Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda Ok look it's time for you to go it's late already I'll see you Mamma says You don't need to go it's too late already you can see what the situation in town So we decided to stay Dinner was Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can We sat down at the But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we're We turned on the television and the show In Fairy Tale Land was coming We cleared the We hear some noise out in the I go out on the balcony but I can't see what's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a story building in the There is mob of people I can't figure out what's They're shouting something looking somewhere I can't make out what is going I go down to a neighbor she's an Azerbaijani we've been friends of her family for about I go down to look from their I see people shouting looking at the and story buildings near the bus Just then soldiers set upon them about people with The mob runs off in different I even see several people from our They are looking and laughing I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing it means they're not killing But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone's kicking him I become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can't speak Well they've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is If each of them kicked him just once They took his club away from him and started to beat him with But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda don't go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and starts shouting We go out onto the All of our neighbors are also out on theirs Everyone is standing The mob is shouting and about minutes later comes running toward our As it turns out at the story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming There's only one entryway there they could stop They all run up to our Mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw They have stones and they break the windows all of There are very many We have a large courtyard and it's packed with They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each They crawl up on trees posts and It's just a huge cloud of They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian from our We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and It's Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name Grisha open the door we've come to kill you or something like I don't remember that I was spaced out kind Mamma says Into the bedroom quickly In the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry Mamma says Hide there they probably won't come in there they'll ask something say something and She says We'll tell them that we live alone I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them I'll talk with them if they come maybe I can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me I speak Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I can't remember if I told her anything or Then they open the door it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the The crows bursts in and starts to shout Get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia things like I tell them What has happened speak One of you tell me calmly what has In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment I say Go We'll gather everything we need and leave the I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are They must be The ones standing in the doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with Too bad They take two or three steps It seems as though I have pacified them with our Then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them Don't you understand what you are saying Kill them And that was it That was all it They grab Papa carry him into one room and Mamma and me into They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her They start tearing my clothes right there in front of I don't remember where they went what they did or how much time I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time I don't even know what I The atrocities I was savagely raped in that They argued among themselves who would go Later I remember I came I don't know if I'm dead or Someone comes in someone tall I think clean shaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat He looks around at what's At that instant everything It seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on He looks and says Well we're done They are beating Mamma on the They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs She loses consciousness and they decide that she's Papa was out They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they can't get the window Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be They leave her next to the She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed She's not a real strong person anyway He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something that I'm still Well I start saying the opposite of what I should be which is humbling myself and I start shouting cursing they don't get any entreaty out of I already know that I'm dead why would I humble myself before anyone And he says that if that's what I think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing In short he commands that I be taken I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda I don't know if they are alive or They take me They are dragging me by my arms by my They are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal While they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me don't even I think my God when will death come If only it were sooner Then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking I lose consciousness What happened after that how many people there were I don't I come to after a while I don't remember how A neighbor is bringing me I'm entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on I remember that I said the same words over and over again Mamma what happened Mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at I can't make sense out of There is a guy standing over me I sort of know him he served in Afghanistan his name is Igor he brought me When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there Igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors' even though he's small minded he put himself at Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani he served in There are three The older brother also served there I think now he's stationed here on the border in Igor brought me to the neighbors' and then helped me come to my senses saying Karina I know you calm down I'm not one of How do I know who's who and what's what I come to and they clean me I was covered in Then Papa I saw Papa I saw And Marina too Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed Marina Lyuda said that she was Russian they said we'll let you go we aren't touching the Russians And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's hands because he knows Marina and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open She opens the door and Igor pushes them in So they My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing While they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed Then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the The neighbor opened and said I'm not going to let you in the apartment because I'm afraid of But I'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the Lyuda says I'll stay at your place because of what's going on they keep going up and down the It was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn't Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed I came Mother was I can't remember my supervisor's telephone number but something had to be Somehow I remembered and called and he came to get He didn't have any idea what was going He thought we were simply afraid he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and He came and got us and took us to the police There they looked us I was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich He's the head of our They took us When we were leaving I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to The buses were ordinary passenger There were very many We left around eleven right after If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives Because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there I think everyone know not only in Sumgait not only in Because there they murdered them all one after the next without After I think people died in Microdistrict and to of them were from Buildings and In our building one person died and one old woman died from Building that's the building in front of There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their Incidentally when we were at the neighbors' Marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was I called a aunt in Microdistrict They have three neighbors who are I said Run quickly I can't explain what's going on hide do what you can just stay Hide at Azerbaijanis' ones who won't give you At that moment three people came in I think they were I was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face was pushed out No one would have thought that I would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at I started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven't you killed people people yet what are you doing here One of the soldiers said Don't scream at We're Muslims but we're not from the Sumgait They called in from So at that point the Daghestan police were When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen I don't know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police I don't know what they were there There were also doctors from Baku They examined Lyuda and me and said These women need to go to the Maternity Home but we don't know what to do with the So they took us and I lost contact with my parents my boss My boss said Don't worry I'll find you no matter where you are no matter what We went to the There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home Pashayeva I think her name She examined The ambulance was from Baku I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything they didn't respond to any People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite I even thought to myself God can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong She looks me over and says Now why are you suffering so You don't know what your people have been doing your people did even worse And I think great I have to deal with her And I felt so bad I thought why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people I just didn't have the energy to say How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done I stayed Then they brought in another woman Ira she was married and she was raped in her own apartment There were three of us Ira Lyuda and The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira They didn't do anything to help This was in the old Maternity Home in the combined They didn't do anything more than examine me that was I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer What shots could have calmed me down I didn't even want to look at I lay in the Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but I was I was alone even though the wards were That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was She asked what had happened to me and I said Better to ask your brother what happened there's no point in asking me your brother can better explain what She fell into a All the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my Then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because I was literally The only thing I had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said I can't believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here I went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from People from work came and brought me something in a sack apples I think three or four pounds but I couldn't take I had become so weak that it was just I said that I couldn't take the apples and really didn't have any No one had to bring me Some woman took the sack And oh yes Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would That it would be Or perhaps someone was outside on the street I don't In any case I didn't sleep a wink that The next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we I didn't even know where they were taking They took me to the club where the troops were the very one I was in that ill fated I got off the Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was I saw a few people I knew there and that calmed me a I had already thought that I was the only one So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that I still didn't know what happened to my parents they didn't come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was I didn't know whether to believe him or Maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I They all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking What happened what went on Two days later they came to see me from They were there all the Each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me They did everything they Of course I'm most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what He constantly took an A sincere interest from the heart Then about two days later the secretary of the Party Committee came not from our Party organization but from the First Trust which ours is part of Comrade Kerimov a very important figure in our He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down There was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to They examined me there several times there I lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows I don't They didn't diagnose anything in When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so There was no way something inside wasn't broken my ribs Well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was There were emergency medical workers on duty in the The mother of one of Marina's friends was She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's They had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what I needed at that moment I I said that I was having great difficulty breathing I couldn't seem to get enough air something was wrong with They put tight bandages around my chest and Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut But I wasn't They took us to the Khimik boarding We lived there a long Soon appeared representatives They were At first people would not talk to them and drove them One of the Armenian women shouted We demand that Seidov come The response was It's Seidov who sent Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of The woman said We'll only see Seidov's daughter have her come here we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we'll deal with you And so More of them said Have Seidov himself This went on day in day The agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to Everything got on our nerves The smell the small There were children at the SK club children who had literally just come out of the Maternity What were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time At first we had to pay to eat They even overcharged us as it turned On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for The children were Everything stank Well imagine about people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than You couldn't sit or lie down it was impossible to even The stench was Even the smallest infants took ill overnight I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan the They have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed People were fainting right and I just don't know everyone was crying everyone Only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it But the women were in a constant state of It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian Then people went up to the I didn't see them I only heard them because I was lying down and couldn't get I lay right on the stage we had some room Apparently they caught two people with either oil or I think they wanted to burn the Maybe someone saw them I didn' I was in no condition to open my Everyone was suspicious of everyone They would ask Aren't you an Azerbaijani I think I saw you somewhere I think you're an They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each Half of the people did not have any There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their So on the on Sunday I think the police did nothing to help On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block They didn't spare a soul there not children not pregnant women They killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew my mother worked with Their daughter in law went to school with my older They were brutally Only the two daughters in law By a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn't take her in so she ran about the building until she found She was pregnant and had two small This all continued on Monday in Block on the when the troops were already in the They murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or I heard that the Lezgins suffered I'm not sure myself I didn't see any Lezgins who had been They burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn' It was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it's all very hard to imagine of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the BTZ plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift Aunt Razmella who also lived in Microdistrict They were stopping buses between Baku and In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait and there were students They were simply savagely They were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded They stopped the buses dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the I didn't see it myself but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn Later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can't call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student Ira if I'm not She was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can't figure out who saved She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the I still can't imagine how he managed to do I heard that from Engels He knows her Well a lot of people went to that hospital She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian and they wrote the words down and I think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad They couldn't find the guy who saved He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn't remember anyone's I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe I had talked with him But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my I can't remember to this day who he Then it seems I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization where Marina She goes to school and works she goes to night school at AZI and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation I'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol We had joint I know them all I've even talked with them and he I know is from An Azerbaijani but from It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in They took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the Procuracy because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case and I iden tified the photographs of people who I could more or less They showed me the people who were in our apartment they're working on our case but I can't even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they're processing it They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like All these people all of them as much as I've heard about them and seen them they were all from The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf Najaf He was there when everything It must have been him because I didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides All the more since I told him Listen you do something because you know He turned away and went toward the bedroom where Marina Well you couldn't see Marina There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out All of it flew right out of my head and then gradually I became myself again at the City Party Committee There were military people I told them what went on and they wrote it all I told them his On March the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization the one we're part of came to see us his name is Najaf I tell Mamma If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think I'm crazy not responsible for my He said What did they do to you how awful myself I hid an Armenian Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different I wasn't at home my family and I went to I said Marina what is he saying He said something totally different After that I didn't go to see our Procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh Fedorov by Fedorov told me that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him and there were so names What are they doing with Rzayev Did he prove his alibi or not They just think that since I was hit in the head I can't say anything for sure whether it was him or It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it but at the same time I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was Because no mat ter who I name they tell me no you're wrong he didn't do that that one wasn't All the faces have gotten mixed up in my Who did what exactly I can't When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but I didn't see it because I had my eyes closed all the It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes So I had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat A young guy held my arms he works at the BTZ And right nearby across the road from us Block is where all this was going Right across the road from The BTZ dormitory is over there that's where he Now he's in custody they even have proved as far as I know that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our One person in our building was killed it was that A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn't come over he just looked and then went into the A while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been That guy went and told them Now they've caught him everything's been Now evidently they've been beating him I don't know what they're doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the Some young guy came to the plant and said Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at That was He said the ones who wanted to This was at the BTZ plant during the night shift probably late Friday It was at night they were at the sauna And he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying The others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking I'm going to But they didn't say anything to one He said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of That guy was also born in That is And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia from I've participated in the investigation a couple of I'm satisfied with them thus They summoned us and asked about what happened and every word I said was I met some guy there By the way he was an I said that he was in our apartment but what he did I don't His last name was Grigorian Eduard He s from Sumgait from Microdistrict He was sentenced I think to five years not his first His mother is I met with him at the KGB in Baku at the Azerbaijani They took us there and showed me There were so many photographs I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and I've got them all I say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a This guy Grigorian I said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a I don't know what he did I can't Maybe he beat me or raped But he was in our At the KGB he started asking me pleading with me there's no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you're like a sister to I took a look at him and thought My God Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like But they were satisfied with my responses because I said everything without great I was there with Then Lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick She wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at She recognized When she came to Lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three They stole everything in the apartment leaving only small At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering Well seeing the faces hearing the voices Two people were saying they could burn the Another says why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and no place to So this guy was in temporary housing he didn't have anywhere to live he was from They were sure that they would get the Besides the neighbors were Why should they burn the apartment they might burn That's what they How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that Armenians lived there We have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us So they didn't set fire to our I don't know I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside if someone had asked me what was happening I would have said that a civil war was going Well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror So a civil war was going on and only the Armenians were being If it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting But they only fought Then I met some women from our building some They are crying they tell me Karina we saw all of it how could it happen They're asking me Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been able to take it or I would have tried to avert it like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our A woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she Two Armenian families live there in her part of the She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and She came down to the entryway and said You'll come in this entryway over my dead So not one of them took it in his head to go in that Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were I don't think that's They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that They couldn't have cared less about her but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped They were just beasts they had smoked so When they came to our place they were all chewing I noticed Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing I think my God maybe I just think that Maybe I'm losing my mind But no they're all chewing Maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of But they were shouting They didn't talk they shouted as though there were deaf people They screamed and screamed Yeah killing killing we're killing the Armenians Only they didn't shout kill they shouted gurun Gurun literally means kill or That's how it was I'll We hid in a captain's apartment he's an Azerbaijani his wife is a We were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the Their kids knew a whole This was in our part of the building on the third When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to Mamma found the courage to A boy said to my mother Where's the gold Mamma said he must have been to years He even looked Russian he was so fair But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair I noticed they were all on the fair He shouted they were all smashing things and he asks Mamma where the gold We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important In a little black bag we kept everything in Mamma doesn't really like to wear She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for They took everything that was lying on the cheval Mamma thinks that the gold saved Because they threw themselves at the gold and Mamma grabbed Papa who was trying to They had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face They had shoved something into his mouth so he would Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off He had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to Mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake What's happened He sees that they are Mamma said At least go and find out what's happening to my daughters even if they've burned them or murdered them at least bring the He went looking for At that moment Lyuda was under the She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her When he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the She wanted to get out and was calling She thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was When she got out from under the bed everyone was And again She thought that she had lost her I'll never leave here never To hell with it It just seems that way to me I'll come to But then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought Lyuda down and Igor carried me in from Or first I was brought in then Lyuda I don't remember what order it happened And Mamma said Listen they're all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other It had more or less calmed down where we Who's dead who's alive we don't I tried to call my I had basically come Mamma says Listen let's go upstairs at least get a mattress or We don't know how long we'll be Maybe they didn't burn I don't get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken I tell Mamma Mamma what do you need any of that for To hell with it We're alive forget the rest of it all of it She says No let's go get at least Maybe we'll leave here spend the night at someone else' Mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son Alik was standing on the lIe was standing there to see if they were They only managed to run up there and grab something one He shouts Come back they're coming They didn't have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another Mamma got my knitting Someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall Someone took Father's old The neighbor his wife Mamma and Papa Marina went with I was in no condition to Neither was We just They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they're dragging something They were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or There was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over Then things more or less calmed I tried to call my Later there was more We were on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor Asya She's an old woman She wasn't at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the She is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially They started pounding on her door and broke it She had two or three beds in there something like that she's a to year old woman who really does not even live Probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a When her grandson came she bought a They started wrecking I started getting sick I think My God what is going on around here When will this end We turned off the lights and As it turns out the people who weren't afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the We didn't know but they didn't come to where we were all the They all knew very well that he was a He went out and closed the door and we sat in his His last name was He's an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or He went out and stood at his They tell him Comrade Captain don't worry we won't harm you you're one of He went upstairs and they say Aren't you taking anything from this apartment He says I don't need And the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard Those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs The women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our Some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a A guy came downstairs really mad and he says Where's the rug I just put it right here They tell him Some guy came and took it and went off toward the He ran off in that Oh I forgot the most important When Igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going They just didn't tell me about it for a long The wife of that military man she didn't want to kill my spirit I was already dead Later she told me that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said Where's the girl who was here And he became The woman tells him She came to She didn't know what to say Think something up Someone carried her off Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole So the woman says She came to and went to the Now our basement is full of So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my They took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel They climbed down in there to get Then one of them said There's so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and She met her death in the That's it we can leave no problem I didn't know that and when I was told I felt Two times A lot worse So they didn't just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any We really didn't want to go back to our When we moved I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because I started remembering it Although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap The people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like I think that they could have helped I don't think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by That means they could have It would have been enough foe one man or women to say What do you think you're doing That's all That would have done There were apartments in our Not one person said it When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one They would have stood up for one of their True they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the The Azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop The old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said If you want to go on living you'll disappear into your So she That trick didn't work on Even the neighbors who helped us move told me OK fine calm down forget that it I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that didn't have any effect on them then I would forget everything Imagine that it happened to your And no one did April Yerevan reference The Sumgait Tragedy Pogroms against Armenians
