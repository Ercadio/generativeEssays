From David Davidian Subject Re Killer In article Soner Yamen responded to article BURAK AFS who wrote AFS Just a quick comment AFS AFS Armenians killed Turks Turks killed AFS AFS Simple as Can anybody deny these facts Jews killed Germans in WWII Germans killed Jews in WWII BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements regardless of what Nazi revisionists say SY My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in SY todays There were villages Kurd Turk different Turkic groups SY Georgian muslim christian Armenian and Very near to SY The people living there were aware of their They were SY different For example my grandfather would not have been happy SY if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian But that did not SY mean that they were willing to kill No They were SY Armenians killed Which Armenians Their neoghbors As far as my SY grandparents are concerned the Armenians attacked first but these SY Armenians were not their They came from other Maybe SY first they had a training at some They were taught to kill people SY to hate Turks Kurds It seems There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in with that of the Armeno Georgian conflicts of late The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish An Armenian Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak Lori and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier hundreds of kilometers away SY Anyway but after they killed raped Turks and other muslim people SY around people assumed that 'Armenians killed us raped our women' SY not a particular group of people trained in some camps maybe backed SY by some powerful After that step you cannot explain these SY people not to hate all I don't follow perhaps the next paragraph will shed some SY So what am I trying to point out First at least for that region SY you cannot blame Turks Kurds etc since it was a self defense SY Most of the Armenians I think are not to blame But since some SY people started that fire it is not easy to undo There are SY People cannot trust eachother It is very difficult to establish SY a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with SY different ethnic cultural religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately SY very easy to start a fire Again the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians Of course as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the This is in no comparison with events years earlier in eastern My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek Erzinka Erzerum Nakhitchevan Tiflis Constantinople SY My grandparents were not bloodthirsty We did not experience SY what they had to They had to leave their lands there were SY ladies old ladies all of her children killed while she forced to SY witness Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves SY unattractive I don't want to go into any graphic My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women and paste potato skins on his face to look The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Because their family was rather influential local Kurds helped them escape before it was too This is why I am alive SY You may think that my sources are They were biased in some SY They experienced their own pain of That is the way it But SY as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors Why SY should they become enemies David Davidian How do we explain Turkish troops on Center for Regional Studies the Armenian border when we can't Box even explain Cambridge MA Turkish MP March
