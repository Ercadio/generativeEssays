Born Second Year Student Sumgait Secondary School Residents at Building Apartment Microdistrict Sumgait Azerbaijan Zinaida On March we arrived in Yerevan and the next day they registered us at the train station and took us to the boarding The conditions were wonderful thanks to our Armenians who received But it's not relaxing all the I don't know how everyone else feels about it but for me it's We don't have a place to call our I had a two bedroom apartment in Sumgait my children went to school and we lived well in It's painful that in our times in in the Soviet period people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children in whom I've put all my efforts and my whole Everything was going well for us my older daughter was studying at the Institute the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly and my youngest had been sick for a long time but had returned to I have been though a lot in my life it's been seven years since I lost my husband I raised my children by Lots of women have similar fates but there's nothing to be done about But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on February and it was just a horror it's On February our relative Ira came to visit She's better friends with my oldest daughter and so right away she asked Where's Vika I say Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days she's supposed to come back My middle daughter Gaya had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing drinking Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira They left and a few minutes went by suddenly I hear I raced out to the balcony our balcony is right across from the bus station we live at the corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets I look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they're all shouting What they're shouting I can't Our neighbor is standing on his balcony I ask Nufar what's happened He says I don't know I can't figure it out I got scared the kids had gone outside and I wanted to run after them but then there was a knock at the I open the door and it's the Mamma says Gayane you'll never believe what's going on out there It's awful Ira says Aunt Zina they're shouting 'Karabagh Karabagh Karabagh is ours ' We didn't know what was going They're threatening to drive out the Armenians and slaughter I called my brother and his wife answered the I said Aunt Tamara don't worry Ira is staying here with us and we'll see her home I couldn't shut my eyes all night long even until I was worried about My God what was going on what had happened Gayane That day on the we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of There weren't yards between our building and the bus We could see and hear everything They were stopping buses dragging people out leading all the passengers out looking for If they found an Armenian on the bus then it started don't know what to call it Zinaida It's called Gayane The mob would descend on people and beat I don't know if they were killing them or not but when they left them they lay still not moving as though nothing was left of One person was lying there and they started dragging The police were standing right there to the side not doing anything they didn't take any steps to calm that It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the And you couldn't go anywhere somehow you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it We wanted to leave Sumgait that What kept us was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union and that something would be done about Where in the world was our government Zinaida We couldn't leave town of course because our older daughter wasn't And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and On Sunday morning when I went to see Ira home our neighbor said Zin' you know they went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he They murdered his father and two Valodya is our neighbor he's an Armenian he lives on the first I think my God what is happening And in broad daylight I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting Slay the Armenians Karabagh is ours This was at o'clock in the On the way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says They beat our store manager they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him but he was an And I asked Did they kill him She says No he's in serious I left there and started to walk home on that same street but the mob started moving in my I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik There I met another crowd but these weren't bandits these were our people from I was so frightened that I walked without knowing where was going I couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my I was walking and there was a boy standing before my This was on the around evening He ran under our balcony and the mob surged toward him shouting He's an Armenian get him He wore a black They grabbed him that boy near the bus stop I saw They grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the I made it home but I just couldn't calm My oldest daughter was in my I was thinking my daughter's coming home now they'll stop her bus and she'll be There's no police no protection It's like they had all died there's no one nothing no authorities I can't even find the words for it I look and see an Ikarus Before going to the bus station they stop near our place across from the Kosmos movie So this Ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling the Azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling Armenians out And I see them take the Armenians and beat them killing I can't watch it any It was a I just couldn't watch But Gaya was standing there watching it and I scolded She says Mamma I have to see it I have to know what's happening I have to see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it So our children will Gayane We saw a great deal on the They caught no less than people before my I can't say for sure if they killed them or not Zinaida There were too many people there the mob was too You couldn't make anything But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own He was or years Gayane I think he was older probably about A tall fellow a big guy in a He was walking quickly but when they shouted that he was an Armenian he tore off And the mob went after They caught him right under our I don't I don't think there could have been much left of him after You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one It was a mob big angry and You know there was a similarity in the way they were dressed mostly they were wearing long black You couldn't even tell them apart they were all wearing black and they all looked Zinaida When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried Mamma I ran into the I couldn't watch any An awful lot was going on right then in various places it wasn't only that boy several people were being beaten You couldn't see all of it at once but when that boy cried Mamma I immediately started watching only Gayane On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at At midnight they dispersed and the police took their They were scattered about in all But how can you explain the fact that by morning when it had already started getting light around seven o'clock our police were gone The police disappeared and yielded their positions to the In the morning they started gathering at our inter section again at the bus station and at the entrance to From morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered and by nine o'clock you couldn't even see the There were thousands of people in the Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Zinaida They had I realized that when I noticed that they made a cross with their arms they crossed their arms over their The cross evidently meant that the vehicle had Armenians in They let the Azerbaijani cars through and they stopped the Armenian ones and started their Gayane They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality He got out and said they were from But what is your nationality He says They immediately start shouting Ermeni Ermeni And he says What's going on I'm coming from I don't live in Doesn't matter who cares if you're from Baku or Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him and they dragged a woman his wife probably out of the At this point the police came and took the two and led them Then the mob started smashing the car and then burned The flames blazed it was a horrible fire Then everyone ran away they thought the car was going to About minutes later another car comes along a green They ran up shouting Ermeni Ermeni But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car they didn't beat Maybe they burned them along with the car because no one emerged from the The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too acquaintances of his walked by below and he asked them and they said Yes they burned them along with the About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by and there was a doll on the first We thought they were Armenians but the cars started to honk They were Azerbaijanis and they were immediately allowed Zinaida The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the ' The whole crowd parted and the procession passed through Gayane By the way at the marriage hall which is right in the courtyard of our building there was a wedding that The Azerbaijanis were cele brating and On the streets there was grief and death people were being killed and people were celebrating the whole Zinaida Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to She went to her girlfriend's in the building she lives in the first entryway on the third Gaya came back and said Mamma the bus is supposed to come around eight after You can imagine what I was feeling how hard it was Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her Then I heard I raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like I started to I am walking around the room crying wailing Vika's not here what will come of her Gaya of course was consoling me Mamma nothing will happen to her don't worry calm down she's in good company they'll look out for Diana I saw the green car The car was burning when we went out onto the Gaya pushed me away telling me to get off the I Then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians Zinaida You're right I forgot about that that was on the Diana There's a small grassy area in front of our balcony there are trees planted The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the All the neighbors said no there are no Armenians There weren't a lot of Armenians in our building but there weren't just a few Armenian families Gayane They fell upon the apartments on the There were terribly many of Our courtyard is huge and it was completely filled with Zinaida Katusev had made an appearance on television He said that two people Azerbaijanis had been killed in And when he said that you know how bees sound have you heard how they buzz It was like the buzzing of millions of bees and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard howling and I don't know how to describe By this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony but when I looked out of the bedroom window the Znaniye Bookstore is down there and Armenians live on the second and fourth floors I saw their things being thrown out the I realized that they would be upon us any I shouted to Gayane Gaya hide the That's honestly what I told my I grabbed I didn't know what to do Vika still wasn't home and it was already getting I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it Gayane Just in case we changed the television channel from the Moscow station to the Azerbaijani Zinaida And turned it up Gayane We never listened to Azerbaijani It just didn't do much for In all those years we almost never listened to But sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani And that was And here we had it turned up full So they would think we were Zinaida Well you can imagine they're slaughtering Armenians robbing them and we're listening to this concert music from Our Azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on Azerbaijani But we already had it on Turn on the lights they told us so they will think you're not They're saying the Armenians are afraid to turn on their lights they're Gayane Apparently there was some kind of arrangement because we noticed that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments that is the Azerbaijanis were warned and every last one of them had their lights When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately and later another Turn on the lights they told us Nothing will Be Nothing will Zinaida We won't allow them to come into your Gayane We believed those We had never done anything bad to Zinaida After the whole nightmare about March before we left for Armenia when I was coming into the building they were all The Azerbaijanis were crying saying Can it be there is no God How could they raise their hands against your family You never did anyone any harm you never refused anyone anything not in hard times or in time of fortune or in time of How could they give you away How could they sell you down the river They really had given us Some of them protected us but others gave us They sold us down the Gayane I was wearing slacks that day and when it all began I became cautious for some reason and I changed my Azerbaijani women don't wear Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants but the Azerbaijanis found that very And I thought I better put on a skirt otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were There was nothing else we could No other way I was forced to turn myself into God knows I let my hair down tousled it and threw a scarf over my Zinaida And she told me Mamma you Take Diana and go into the other You two look more like They'll figure out that we're Armenians right But how could I go away and leave her there Gayane I went out onto the It worked out better that We were the only Armenian family in the fourth This gave us hope we were the only ones the neighbors wouldn't let them They the Azerbaijanis would fear for themselves and for their I looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below it was easy to get up onto our When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that So I turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our He looks at me and shouts What nationality are you here Zinaida At the same time they were knocking on the Gayane What nationality are you he's Well at first I was frightened but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect Azerbaijani You should be ashamed of yourself asking a question like Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani If I were an Armenian would I come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes He looks at me and tells the people with him Yes Azerbaijanis live From below they tell him Check it out it can't be they have to be And he asks me again What nationality are you I say Can't you see I started I could not say anything You're blind that's for sure You can yell all you want but that won't make us I hear them breaking down our door and Mamma went toward the I say I don't have time to deal with you they're breaking down our go to the door and ask Who is it They answer Open up I say Wait why are you breaking the door What's going on I'm opening We never locked the lower lock it was broken but now they had locked it out of fear and I couldn't get it I say wait I'm looking for the I opened the door it was almost broken down I opened the door and they burst I say What's going on Why are you breaking down our door Zinaida Then they started climbing in from the They're shouting Why don't you open the door And I say Well you've already come in the Then Diana sees their knives runs into the bathroom and closes the Gaya cries out Mamma Diana ran into the bathroom I ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis and said in Armenian Diana open the door Gaya tried to calm them down and I'm shouting with tears in my eyes for Diana to open the Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll Little Red Riding That guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow They put it up to Mamma's I ran to the bathroom opened the door and slammed it behind I was frightened and started to I shouted Mamma they want to kill you And then then they started shouting Give us your And Gaya says What do you need passports for we're Gayane I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis I was trying everything I could I could get on my knees and I could humble myself because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my To be honest I didn't care about anything else as long as my little sister would survive her life and health had cost us so dearly I tell them What don't you understand anything They started shouting they were tremendously excited shouting with terribly loud voices saying that in Stepanakert their girls were being killed raped and tossed around with Why shouldn't they do the same to us I said Who's doing all that Who is doing it Some Armenians What does that have to do with us Give me the knife I'll cut my own Now you calm down they tell Zinaida I told them Why didn't you deal with them there There in Karabakh Nothing has happened here no one has been fighting here not we with the Armenians nor they with Why didn't you give it right back to them there What've we got to do with this I got I had been saying that we were Azerbaijanis but suddenly I started speaking as though I were an Armenian but they didn't One of them was next to me with a knife at my And he says to the others What pretty He meant Gaya and my year old I was Gaya started assuring them that we were One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad Gayane He demanded the I said Young man I don't have my passport He says Let's have the passport we won't believe you without your And one of them started hurriedly searching for They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down took the picture off the wall and started pulling the clothes off their hooks yelling and shouting Passport Passport They all started yelling there was so much noise in the They were all My hair stood on Suddenly I said Listen my Papa died days haven't passed yet we have a Muslim household we're in mourning you should be ashamed of yourselves you've disgraced your And then Mamma started to Zinaida I started crying My husband died days haven't yet passed aren't you ashamed of yourselves In fact my husband had died seven years earlier in We're in mourning and you burst in here demanding docu The documents are at the housing office I'm filing for my Well it seemed like they believed Then one guy said They're Can't you see there are no men here only Another fellow in the group agreed with him he also said that we were But a third said No they're Well the other two convinced him I don t know how and all the rest of them listened to them There were about of them if not more all in our three room apartment even the entryway was They started Yes we're Lezgins we're They started leaving and one of them took our tape recorder with And the one who had first called us Lezgins says Leave that what are you doing They seemed to obey that Gayane He was tall wearing baggy jeans and a Zinaida With a little moustache I Gayane No he didn't have a moustache he was tall with brown hair he wasn't a bad looking He didn't have anything in his Zinaida He stood at the Gayane Yes he didn't look like a bad guy and you know his face seemed familiar to I had seen him And more than But I can't remember When he came in I was stupefied I had a premonition that he wouldn't be able to remain When he said that we were Lezgins and that they should leave such gladness started to glow inside of They continued to argue on their way Some said They're Armenians all the And that fellow answered even if they are Armenians it's shameful the father died they're mourning there's nothing but women in the house there's no We should stay out of the What do you mean stay out We can go in there And he said No we should stay out they're Lezgins we're leaving The three of them protected Zinaida No the two of The one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit who stood at the threshold about or years Well they were all young The two of them defended Diana Three three Zinaida Do you remember the third one Diana Diana Yes he was wearing dark Gayane The third one was the one who came He wore a long brown Diana He wore a long darkish brown coat and his hair was dark When they left they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians and ran back and said that they were going to kill Zinaida They had all left and we had started to calm down a little and I closed the And then there is a I told Gaya Take Diana and go into the other My daughters went into the dining room and I opened the There was a guy there who said Run hide They're coming to kill you now We ran up to the third We had some good neighbors up there I sent the kids and stood there alone not knowing what to I was so far gone Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything to I even forgot to take my work documents at the time I had been preparing a report to send to Baku and the documents were at I couldn't see anything I could only see Vika my older I sent Gaya and Diana upstairs and stood there asking that fellow Should I close the door and leave everything like this He says What do you mean door Get out of here they're coming to kill you What are you standing there for And I ran after the Gayane We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting Where are the Armenians We were already at the neighbors' They had an infant at the time and the neighbor said Don't you worry I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter Zinaida On the third floor there I started asking the folks our neighbors to go meet The bus was due to arrive at eight o' I dissolved in tears Gaya was soothing me Diana was next to us she was crying too and I'm already thinking that I've lost my older daughter but deep in my heart I still believe she's alive And my tears choked I was going out of my But no one could leave the building the courtyard was packed with people swarming with From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits Where are those Armenians the ones who were at home Where did they make off to They told him they didn't They asked him where he He answered Can't you see on the third He asked them specially to divert attention from his own We heard them taking free reign of our apartment and they threw our color television off the balcony and it Gayane Mamma was crying the whole She fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside alternately raving and sobbing shouting and calling She didn't notice us probably because we were next to Her thoughts were only on The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too offering Zinaida We are very grateful to Thanks to them my children and I are alive well and When they were throwing our belongings out and burning them the beds the pillows and the chairs our neighbor came to us and said How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked but some other woman You're from our part of the building you lost your husband you have children thank God you're not in her position we wouldn't have been able to take I don't know what I would He of course wouldn't have done anything he was just trying to calm us In the yard they were torturing our neighbors fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth floor in the third A married couple Vanya and Nina and their three Their last name is They hid their two daughters and stayed with their son to defend themselves they even got boiling water ready and an axe and held them off for a long time but the They beat up the husband dragged the wife outside and stood her naked next to our burning things her husband was lying at her feet on the The crowd shouted Look at the naked Armenian They were going to throw the poor woman into the The neighbors came out an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf and she covered herself with it and the neighbors led her off to their All the neighbors saw and heard it Gayane Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing there and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her Our neighbor who lived in the same entryway as Nina she lives with us in the same boarding house now saw what they had done Nina showed her from her knees up almost up to her neck her whole body was covered riddled with Zinaida In the morning during the night of the rather after one o'clock two buses approached the I wanted to run By then I didn't care any more if I lived or died but Gayane wouldn't let me go and the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about them my other children but I could only think of I imagined her torn to pieces I'm a mother and they're just children they don't understand I would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for I was going to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me Mamma please Mamma I beg of you The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her So we held on that way till On the morning of the I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to our apartment maybe Vika was lying there He told me he would go He was gone for about five minutes but it seemed like an eternity to He returned and said there was no one there I went down too stole down like a mouse and slipped in everything was thrown all I didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away farther than the bus I began looking for the briefcase with my work in I was miserable because of my daughter and at the same time because of my My documents were there my travel papers I worked in the transport division and my trip Gayane Mamma is a very responsible person she was always ready to work around the clock to do her Zinaida I look around and I can't find the I didn't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms that everything was smashed and the furniture was broken I worried about that later but at first I was concerned about the lost I went into the My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove my ring and my It was all Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said Mamma And Diana came downstairs Gayane found her coat among the debris and Diana found her track shoes her coat and some of her Diana Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under They threw a television onto the asphalt it exploded so violently it sounded like a Then when Vika wasn't there I wouldn't eat and they forced me but I couldn't Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the When we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken right away I started looking for my dolls and my books but I didn't see When we went back upstairs I managed to take two cups from my tea service and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own My Italian boots were gone my brown coat it was beautiful there wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls and my giant lion was gone too the one that had been on top of the He was very large and very I had two satchels one for first grade and the other for second grade one was yellow green with a boy and a girl on it they're playing a drum and a violin and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears and on the other one were the letters A B C D E and the numbers two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are They were beautiful They were gone I had many books I collected them they were in the bedside And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday they weren't around And I had some big books fat ones and they disappeared only one was left The Malachite The Adventures of Karlson Pippi Longstockings and Fairy Tales of the World were All the other books were Zinaida I continued searching for my briefcase and then my supervisor He had waited for me until nine o'clock but I didn't appear and he thought something must have happened so he He's a Russian Aleksei Semyonovich Alik Aliyev the mechanic came with When they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified they could not say a When I saw them I started My Azerbaijani neighbors came Some of them were crying others were helping me pick I go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the Now that I remember it it's both funny and painful How could I have thought that I had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal Incidentally later when I went back to the apartment again those things were gone And the door was After my supervisor left in the afternoon the neighbor said that we should leave find another I'm afraid he said that someone saw you come to my apartment and that they could kill you and us My God where could I go it was daytime and those I don't even know what to call them the bandits those marauders those jackals I don't know what to call them I can't find the words they were Where should I go with two girls When I opened the door I had tears in my eyes and I was terrified And he said Go to Alik's he's an Azerbaijani and I say You should have said that earlier when my supervisor was here with the car he could have taken us with Everyone feared for their own What could I do I went out into the entryway and And he says any other time I would keep you here a year or But right now I'm sorry Then another door opened also on the third I ask the neighbor Tayara can we hide at your place She's an Azerbaijani She says What kind of question is that Come in She hid There were many people in the courtyard and Gaya and I hid in the wardrobe and they put Diana under a mattress leaving a small opening so the child could Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out and when they came back she would hide us We sat in the wardrobe for about a half Gaya became ill and I allowed her to get My legs fell asleep and felt like We hadn't eaten or drunk anything for so long since the when we saw that horror and all of it just snapped in Tayara's husband went outside even though I begged him to stay saying there should be a man in the He said that he'd be in the courtyard and if anything happened his wife would signal She put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani My girls went to the window and what was going on out there I feared for my children that someone would recognize them from the Gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani but directly across there was a story building their windows were right across from us and I shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the But she kept on Diana I watched Zinaida Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the The soldiers didn't shoot they didn't have orders I saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers they were young boys and year olds and they defended themselves I'm a mother after all and they were no different from my When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to stop looking l couldn't watch anymore I imagined my children in their shoes Gayane The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station Block and our Microdistrict But they only cordoned them off from the The mob fell upon the soldiers who started to protect themselves and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after They caught several Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their One fell down and they cracked open another's head Zinaida They show Lebanon on television and the war in Afghanistan that's just what it was Like in America how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubs that's just how it was in our Gayane Don't compare it with America those were peaceful demonstrations but these Zinaida But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America They attacked the soldiers hurled stones at them Then I thought where's the tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators If they had used gas on those jackals they all would have Gayane They would not have The soldiers had been there since morning they didn't bring in fresh They hadn't eaten they were fine standing there for about three hours but then they got They weren't even allowed to sit down At noon they the soldiers attacked them and then the tables were The mob went after the soldiers the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at And those guys sat there covering themselves with their And meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets They always say Our children have never seen I never even dreamed about it there was no need But then I thought about those people who had lived through a It was truly horrible The guys were tired exhausted some had had their clubs taken away others their shields they had been beaten they were covered in blood so many died They beat the soldiers with their own clubs and And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves they couldn't open They couldn't even defend themselves let alone It's comical Zinaida What are you saying How can it be funny Gayane No I didn't mean that How could something like that happen during our Soviet period It's painfully embarrassing And they burned the armored personnel carriers Someone shouted Get away it's going to blow Everyone scattered away and the armored personnel carrier The soldiers lost their And when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury they drove right up on the Zinaida The bus that had brought the Only the driver was in The bus ran over three people straight off I saw And two armored personnel carriers ran over four All in one or two The bus ran over three one of the carriers ran over two and the second two Right on our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places one of the armored personnel carriers went that way and they say it ran over several over there But they ran over seven before our Then the bus ploughed into a book Gayane No that was a flower It was a new He drove straight into Zinaida The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on Gayane And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to There

special flights of children right from there to Minvody Yerevan and One woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Zinaida The worst was truly behind us by Everything had passed but the pain will remain for our whole It cannot be Under no circumstances should we our children or our grandchildren Who will answer for those who died For our mothers sisters brother sons and daughters Who will bear the responsibility Who will wash away their blood Someone should be made to answer and severely so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased It isn't over yet now we live here in Armenia protected but the issue isn't We would like to stay in Armenia in our homeland so that all the Armenian people will be Then we will be Armenians won't be scattered throughout the Soviet Union about the world and if we're all together this won't happen As a mother of three children as a woman as a sister I ask Armenians to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen Our homeland The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting So that our children can work for the good of If we aren't able to then let our children do And if it's possible we'll work for the good of Armenia This is the land of our Our grandfathers and great grandfathers lived here too it was only later that people dispersed all Like a mother the land
