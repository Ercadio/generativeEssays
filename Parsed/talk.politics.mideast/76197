From Edward A Shnekendorf Subject Re Israeli Terrorism Andi Beyer writes I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering reported accurately on what was happening in It is interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion I wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda Unless you want to provide some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism I suggest you keep your mouth I'm sick and tired of all you anti semites comparing Israel to the Nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare Israel to the Nazis you are an anti semite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are just trying to discredit Israel
