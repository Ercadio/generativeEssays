From Paul Thompson Schreiber Subject THE ENEMY WITHIN THE ENEMY WITHIN By Robert Friedman The Village Voice May XXXVIII How The Anti Defamation League Turned the Notion of Human Rights on Its Head Spying on Progress ives and Funneling Information to Law Enforcement Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and read I Led Three Lives Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of penetrating the Communist Party for the Philbrick had become an American folk hero in the for building dossiers on unsuspecting It was a time when Hollywood produced more than films portraying the informer as the quintessential American In Boston where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant Communist Party member and private citizen the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a For Bullock a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight arrow ' the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick Bullock recently told federal investigators and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the Communist In I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow with the American I gave them the FBI a full report on it when I returned along with some photos I took of some Soviet military Bullock was For the next two years he worked as an unpaid informant for the But he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the Anti Defamation League in Now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent American history a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Over a year period he compiled computer files for the ADL on individuals and more than groups of all political stripes including the NAACP the Rainbow Coalition ACLU the American Indian Movement the Center for Investigative Reporting Pacifica ACT UP Palestinian and Arab groups Sandinista solidarity groups Americans for Peace Now and anti apartheid Bullock who even spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when he visited the Bay Area in April sold many of his ADL files on anti apartheid activists to South African Meanwhile between and the ADL paid him nearly using a prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with Last month police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as Bullock's home confiscating computer files and boxes of According to court records Bullock's files contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information in addition to criminal histories on individuals much of which was allegedly stolen from the FBI and police Bullock told the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the San Francisco ADL Based on the evidence says Inspector Ron Roth in a police affidavit I believe that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and DMV What's more the San Francisco is investigating Bullock for tapping phones accessing answering machines and assuming false identities to infiltrate Documents seized from Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area trash cans He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the Christic Institute in San Francisco as well as telephone message slips to staff members including names and phone numbers of callers office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders and inter office He also had receipts from Christic Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees the dates and Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic Institute's checking Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with Israeli government What's more Israel apparently used tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled The ADL was established in New York City in to defend Jews and later other minority groups from It led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party and in the championed the civil rights But there was also a darker In the late the ADL spied on leftists and Communists and shared investigative files with the House Committee on Un American Activities and the The ADL swung sharply to the right during the Reagan administration becoming a bastion of To Irwin Suall a repentant Trotskyite who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department the real danger to Jews is posed not by the right but by a coalition of leftists blacks and Arabs who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in America as well as the state of In the tradition of his ideological soulmate William Casey Suall directed the ADL's vast network of informants who were given code names like Scumbag Ironside and for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta For years journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community knew the ADL spied on right wing hate As long as the targets were anti Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon Larouche no one seemed to be particularly But the Bullock case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent and progressive This apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco where the investigation The human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as felony counts including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police Says one source close to the West Coast investigation It is per cent certain that the ADL will be In the wake of the San Francisco investigation police probes of ADL spying are spreading to other parts of the We have received numerous complaints about ADL spying says Sam Adams a spokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland On April the Harlem based Black United Fund of New York and African American self help group that Bullock allegedly spied on wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau requesting an immediate investigation of the The ADL's actions cause great concern as it is a direct and flagrant violation at minimum of our civil call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San Francisco and end to this latest form of Gerald McKelvey a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office says We have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San Francisco 's office on their pending They have not so far asked for our The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence prone groups with law enforcement It also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations but says in a two page press release The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news clips magazine articles books journals and other ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency and the process by which the League gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being That's what the ADL says for public But morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying And even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show of solidarity many do so holding their More than a few Jewish officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti Semitism and extremist groups says Daniel Levitas the former executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal an Atlanta based group that monitors anti Semitism racism and hate One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous with American Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the ADL's Cold War In he moved to Southern California where he became an ADL spy for a Bullock almost always used his real name when snooping although he once called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of Alabama governor George Bullock provided the ADL's office in Los Angeles with written reports which were transmitted to Fact Finding Department head Irwin Suall according to court Under Suall's stewardship Fact Finding Department had become the ADL's heart and Located at ADL national headquarters across from the United Nations the department had assembled a vast library on hate groups culling material from publications speeches and informants Bullock was more than adept at leading a double Not long after moving to California he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston There he found a file the right wingers were keeping on the The discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that they had somehow been penetrated by the Bullock focused almost exclusively on right wing extremist groups until the early when ADL head Milton Sinn was replaced by Harvey Schechter who encouraged him to target the left as A few years later Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco where he posed as an art And ADL fact finder who had infiltrated the local Arab community had just been When the ensuing scandal died down Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate the The ADL was especially concerned about the American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee founded by the former South Dakota senator James Abourezk to combat Arab In a page out of the CIA's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization Bullock joined the ADC and then recruited Nazis into the group apparently trying to discredit it according to published In the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of Arab Americans annual congress in According to court documents Bullock was told to find the source of the group's Bullock was unable to follow the But he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA delegation that visited Congress member Nancy It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab But only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT As far as Bullock was concerned gay groups in San Francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries prompting him to write about their activities for the Bullock soon expanded his horizons moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut the head of ADL's San Francisco office introduced him to Thomas Gerard in Gerard was then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the CIA in El Salvador in the early where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right wing death Police searching Gerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and interrogation photos of blindfolded and chained men as well as passports made out to Gerard in different names including Thomas From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines where he fled last November Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he will blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy After their very first encounter in the ADL office Gerard and Bullock had lunch at McDonald's I liked Tom right off Bullock later told a San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the Voice Tom is a very charming roguish character with a great deal of Let me say here I consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked with Honest capable intelligent and percent Before long Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL reports on various groups and In turn Gerard gave Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans skinheads and Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material ended up in his ADL I would say percent of the data that I got was name address and sometimes physical Criminal history very rarely Bullock told Gerard also gave Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East terror groups as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans receiving weapons training Bullock claims that Customs in New York gave Gerard the It was understood that Bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard gave him and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or other law enforcement officers says an FBI There was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law By the mid the ADL was swapping files with hundreds of official friends the organization's euphemism for law enforcement and intelligence The ADL's relationship with the FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on Arab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were must It's no accident that police found a classified FBI report entitled Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine PFLP New York Area while searching the ADL's San Francisco In ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in California universities on student When the ADL discovered they were disseminating PFLP literature it informed the FBI which in turn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives ADL regional director David Lehrer gloated in the Los Angeles Times about his office's cooperation with law enforcement although he's backpedaling The Los Angeles deportation is still under While the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops it enjoyed similar ties with Israel's spy agencies a charge that ADL leaders vehemently But as early as July ADL director Benjamin Epstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes requesting for his Our information he boasted to Joftes in addition to being essential for our own operations has been of great value and service to both the United States Department and the Israeli All data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the In the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard spy While assigned to the Navy's Anti Terrorist Alert Center where he had access to the most closely guarded secrets Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for Israel which according to federal prosecutors could fill a room the size of a large feet by six feet by six Pollard's handler was Avi Sella an Israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the New York ADL as a Pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli spy While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was involved with Pollard there is evidence that the ADL freely passes information to Israeli In March the FBI interrogated David Gurvitz an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to Gurvitz admitted that in he had learned from a law enforcement contact that Michael Elias allegedly a member of a radical PLO faction was scheduled to travel from San Francisco International Airport en route to Gurvitz phoned the deputy Israeli consul general in with the Later the same day according to a page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the Voice Gurvitz was called back by another man who said he was from the Israeli Consulate and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information about Gurvitz did not get this man's name but their conversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an Israeli Consulate Among the names of private citizens that police found in ADL files in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad a year old Chicago resident who was arrested in Israel on January for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas the large Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied The Chicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work with official friends in local law enforcement according to documents released by the San Francisco and sources close to the Given these facts Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has passed information on Jarad to Israeli One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American community in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral According to sources familiar with the practice ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals which sometimes turned into PLO Palestinians have been detained at Ben Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in Chicago according to Suhail Miari the executive director of the United Holy Land Fund whose cousin was an Arab member of Israel's Shortly after Jarad was arrested the Israeli government announced that Hamas was being run from America with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or Israel's charges were played up on the front page of The New York Times According to well placed sources Yehudit Barsky an ADL fact finder in New York worked closely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification introducing friendly reporters to official friends in Chicago law Barsky who is fluent in Arabic prepared an ADL report about how Hamas is funded in She identified the Dallas based Islamic association for Palestine in North America as the front organization for Hamas in the Its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations small businesses and individual activists says the February ADL report which outlines the organization's development its activities on college campuses and its metamorphosis during the Gulf It also traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front groups from Plainfield Indiana to Culver City It is doubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of official friends and ADL Barsky refused to But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for AIPAC whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the Voice The level of cooperation was very close Slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate If we felt our files were lacking we contacted the When Sha'wan Jabarin a year old Palestinian human rights worker in the Occupied Territories won a Reebok Human Rights Award in Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire police file which she had obtained from the Israeli Jabarin had been arrested numerous times in Israel and once confessed to being a member of the PLO after having been severely Jabarin who received a short jail term became an Amnesty International Prisoner of Of course to AIPAC and the ADL Jabarin was a Slabodkin who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the to receive his award called a representative of Al Haq the Palestinian human rights group that employed Jabarin to obtain his AIPAC even opened a file on musician Jackson Browne who presented Jabarin with the Reebok While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of Arabs and even left wing gay revolutionaries it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on anti apartheid David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact finder for the ADL in in March ADL files already bulged with information about the Israel South African connection and anti apartheid Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely collect information on persons engaged in anti apartheid activities in the United States says the FBI While Gurvitz said there were files in the ADL office dating to the he estimated the oldest material on anti apartheid activities dates back to the late paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a deepening of ties between the Jewish state and South In about August says the report of the FBI's March interview with Gurvitz an anti apartheid demonstration was held at the South African Consulate in Los Participating in the demonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist Workers Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions and a subsequent He wrote a report for the ADL on each of the planning sessions and on the Copies of the reports were disseminated to Bullock among others in care of the San Francisco ADL In Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African Consulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting organized by Willis Carto the head of the anti Semitic Liberty Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is says the FBI report Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want to warn the South Gerard agreed and informed the Consul General who canceled his A few months later Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African intelligence officer wanted to meet During a rendezvous in a hotel near Fisherman's Wharf the South African said he was interested in acquiring information on American anti apartheid The South African who called himself Humphries also asked for information about groups that were advocating Gerard who was present throughout the meeting says the FBI report told Humphries that he Gerard had been employed by the offered to pay Bullock per month in exchange for Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of Bullock and the Between and Bullock sold information to South African intelligence receiving steady raises which he split evenly with Bullock said it was his impression though Gerard never explicitly told him so and Bullock never asked that Gerard may have been telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South Africans says the FBI Gerard had said he knew the CIA 'resident agent' in San after Gerard dropped Bullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie who replaced Humphries as their handler Gerard said he was going to go to the San Francisco CIA Al the while Gerard may have been tasking Bullock for the Bullock recalled that once after he had met Gerard Bullock went to Chicago Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL says the FBI The target of the investigation was a group called the Palestine Human Rights Bullock learned that a woman name deleted was transporting money between the PLO or the PFLP and the United Bullock told this to Gerard later told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to gather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Bullock however never did go Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad which may have started in when he went on an ADL junket to The ADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials to Israel where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence According to an affidavit by San Francisco police inspector Roth the all expense paid trip to Israel was more or less a thank you gift and a liaison gesture by the ADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the United Gerard may have liked what he saw in A short time after travelling there he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's rescue of Ethiopian As Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened he talked more openly about his exploits in the Bullock recalled Gerard mentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business and that Gerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses ' says the FBI report To this Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined that the PLO and the African National Congress were Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Louie also told Gerard and Bullock about his adventures inside South Africa as an intelligence Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war stories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow ' Although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement's investigation of the ADL it was probably the theft of a classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San Francisco Police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the ADL San Francisco Gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to Mira Boland the director of the ADL's fact finding division in Washington Boland was preparing an op ed piece for The Washington Times in which she argued that the Nation of Islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of because the group is anti Semitic and violence Boland who had arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard testified in a criminal trial in Roanoke Virginia that she had worked for the CIA for months and later was a subcontractor for the Defense Department before joining the During the trial Boland admitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation only ADL After he was questioned by the FBI last fall Gerard fled to the Philippines which has no extradition treaty with Gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the ADL but to Israel and South Africa as The San Francisco Examiner reported that Gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage Although Bullock worked for the ADL for years and Irwin Suall praised him in a July memo as our number one investigator the ADL now argues that he was a rogue In its own defense the ADL also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than After all ask ADL officials don't journalists keep files But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's method of gathering information couldn't be more Journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods distortions and And for the most part journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police The ADL has no such Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny false information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be Once a proud human rights group the ADL has become the Jewish thought The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for everyone says Chip Berlet a highly respected researcher at the Massachusetts based Political Research Associates which monitors right wing extremist That's fine but it can't do that and spy on It's blatantly unethical and frankly My argument to people is that the ADL wears four Each of the hats independently is It is a broad based human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and It is a group that defends Jews against Entirely Nothing wrong with that It is a group whose leaders at least consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics which again is entirely And it is a group that maintains an information sharing arrangement with law Again there is nothing wrong for a group to do But you can't do all It is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of There's a built in conflict of interest if you wear all four ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such In a September letter to the Voice Foxman complained ADL has a proud year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional Any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless Throughout his pieces on AIPAC's spying Friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander and the existence of files as a token of McCarthyite The depiction is misleading in several Virtually every journalist academic politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges the Library of Congress is tantamount to the Moreover disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation Ask Jesse Jackson James Abourezk or the leaders of the New Jewish Agenda all past targets of ADL At the same time the ADL exonerated the fascist World Anti Communist League which assisted Ronald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua a policy endorsed by ADL In the early researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet fact finding head Irwin Suall to discuss their work on anti Semite Lyndon Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this really terrific investigator says So we introduce ourselves say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us about what our political activities are who we work with what organizations we belong Obviously he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very And then he leans forward and says 'The right wing isn't the The left wing is the The Soviet Union is the biggest problem in the world for It's the American left that is the biggest threat to American You're on the wrong You're part of the ' We were I was virtually in This is not how I perceived We basically stumbled out of there in a Letters response to Friedman's article The Village Voice May XXXVIII A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN Robert Friedman's assault on the Anti Defamation League The Anti Defamation League Is Spying On May demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his The story is replete with inaccuracies innuendos and outright falsehoods and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from reality as to be Friedman is even wrong on such basic easily determined facts as where ADL was founded Chicago not New York and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured ADL has done the work of fighting haters for years without spying on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti Jewish racist anti democratic and violence prone and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public Through the years we have published scores of reports on anti Semitism emanating from both the left and the In fact although Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary ADL's primary concern is still the far Because extremist organizations are highly secretive sometimes ADL can learn of their activities only by using undercover Friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative Some have performed great service to the American people for example by uncovering the existence of right wing extremist paramilitary training camps with no recognition and at considerable personal The information ADL obtains is placed in the public domain and through the years ADL has established a reputation for accurate Friedman's article by contrast contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record A few examples He states that an ADL leader was deeply involved in the Jonathan Pollard Israeli spy operation and that Pollard's handler's wife worked for the New York ADL as a Not Friedman also states ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped Palestinian Not Elsewhere he asserts that ADL was obsessed with spying on anti apartheid Again not We could go on and on and of course Friedman does not reveal his The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of When it comes to how much ADL paid Roy Bullock a week as an independent contractor not an employee an important distinction Friedman also fails to make he includes the zeros inviting the reader to see a large By contrast when he observes that ADL paid Bullock nearly between and he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than a year hardly an excessive What is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description of ADL's four Yes ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and Yes ADL defends Israel against And yes ADL maintains an information sharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate We see no conflict in these four activities and we believe most Voice readers won't ABRAHAM FOXMAN National Director Anti Defamation League Manhattan ROBERT FRIEDMAN REPLIES For the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is Journalists don't spy on Arabs and anti apartheid activists and then freely pass their files to South African and Israeli But according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators buttressed by pages of court documents and interviews the ADL Indeed the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti Semitic nor Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Respected intellectuals and Middle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views have ended up on ADL blacklists their reputations Private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies says an April editorial in the Louis Post Dispatch condemning ADL On April police armed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and after concluding that ADL employees were apparently less than truthful in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's sworn Roth also asserts that Bullock was a paid employee for the If so by failing to pay taxes on of income paid to Bullock the ADL could face a total of felony counts according to court The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police As for errors The ADL was founded in Chicago and moved to New York in But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building shown in the Voice photo moving out a few months I never wrote that an ADL leader was deeply involved in the Pollard Israeli spy I reported that Pollard himself made the And in court papers Pollard's own lawyer said that the wife of Pollard's handler worked for the If I have a bias it is on the side of the First and Fourth
