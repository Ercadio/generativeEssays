circumstance seems to have taken a certain toll on Serdar perhaps he should be posting to rather than Excuse me We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of Our troops surrounded village after Little resistance was Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the Some of the Tartars escaped of They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into The rest were And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a This is the worst crime in It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of million Muslims People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of million Turks has been well documented over the past six We cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their Source Bristol Papers General Correspondence Container Bristol to Bradley Letter of September I have it from absolute first hand information that the Armenians in the Caucasus attacked Tartar Turkish villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the Lets get somethings Why not Armenians are no angels but they were subject to Turkish And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide Are you for real Tell me 'Halsall' were you high on ASALA SDPA ARF forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that Where is your non existent list of Here is mine During the First World War and the ensuing years the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering million Muslims and deporting the rest from their year The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the Century acted upon an entire This event is

Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries ' Klaus Schwarz Werlag Freiburg page During the fifteenth century when the Ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the Balkans there was considerable turmoil among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which Ottoman life particularly when compared to life in Europe held for the There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews fled to Ottoman The regularity of these reports suggests that the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and eastward from Western and Central It is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of Jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward Muslim page In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the He was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth Sarfati himself was from Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the Ottoman Jews prevailed upon him to write their European coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the Ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to Palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried page impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim Jewish Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews '' their sworn enemies and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the There are well known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda in the early sixteenth century and of We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek page It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved Jews Muslims and Christians were aware of the page seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly The two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between Muslims and Jews neither of whom had much in common with the page The general impression of Muslim Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman page From the period before we have only a few indications that the Ottoman Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the Ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines and the protection and the security which the Ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the Jews recognized their mutual page It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth That they played an important role in both cannot be It is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the Ottomans as well as did the It is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between Jews and the non Jewish society in which they We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the Jews Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious A version of Rabbi Sarfati's Tzarfati letter is given by page Your cries and sobs reached We have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German hear
