From Kamil Ucer Subject Re Turkey Cyprus Bosnia Serbia Greece Armenia Azeris In article writes I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about the Treaty of Sevres as a consequence of being in the Axis powers in Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their minorities Greeks Armenians Kurds I must say Turk Kurd relations are improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to Turkey's The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty the Germans grudgingly accepted Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the German people Greeks who had an army there were there with BRITISH and FRENCH backing to enforce In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies this was after the Greek forces were were destroyed at this occurred incidently FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH as they clawed they're way up the sides of the Libertae egalitae It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of First thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of The new independence movement which by the way is not the same as the Young Turks naturally rejected it out of to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Second the Sevres treaty was even worse than It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones had the capital occupied the economy under Allied control the army di minished to nothing but a police force in short a country in name I'd wonder if you would like to live under such And for the record I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR Before evacuating the city the Greek forces burned it down so it serves them As for being fooled by Allied promises that too is your You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder as Burak Ucer
