From Dorin Baru Subject RE was Go Hezbollah Brad Hernlem writes I just thought that I would make it clear in case you are not familiar with my past postings on this subject I do not condone attacks on Hezbollah and other Lebanese Resistance fighters are skilled at precision bombing of SLA and Israeli I find such methods to be far more restrained and responsible than the Israeli method of shelling and bombing villages with the hope that a Hezbollah member will be killed along with the civilians I do not consider the killing of combatants to be Soldiers are trained to die for their Three IDF soldiers did their duty the other These men need not have died if their government had kept them on Israeli Is there any Israeli a civilian in your opinion Now I do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of But you claim these are villages with civilians and Iraelis claim they are camps filled with You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or If they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right I am not so As somebody wrote Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting And he also claimed 'civilians murdered' Let me ask you isn't there at least a slight chance that you not only and the question is very general no insult are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon Now a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean How do you define Israeli soil From what you say if you do not clearly recognize the state of Israel you condone killing israelis Dorin are you aware that the IDF sent helicopters and gun boats up the coast of Lebanon the other day and rocketted a Palestinian refugee north of Perhaps I should ask YOU what qualifies a person for murder I do not know what was the pupose of the action you If it was to kill civilians I doubt I certainly DO NOT CONDONE If civilians were killed i do not condone That they are Palestinian That they are children and may grow up to be terrorists That they are female and may give birth to little terrorists Brad Hernlem Hernlem it was YOU not ME who was showing a huge satisfaction for israelis human beings by most standards Don't know about your standards If you ask me those questions I will have no problem answering not with a question as you did No NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements maybe after eliminating all Israelis jews Am I wrong Now tell me did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in let's say Tel Aviv From what I understand a lot of palestineans What does it show It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me But again I may be wrong and the jewish controlled media distorted the information and I am just an ignorant victim of the media like most of Dorin
