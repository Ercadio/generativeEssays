From Jake Livni Subject Re Israeli destruction of mosque s in Jerusalem In article writes Allegations of Jewish disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture and rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms than blood About years ago there was a lot of noise about a Church in the Old City of Jerusalem being taken over by a Jewish In fact the building in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was not physically connected to any It had been leased to a Palestinean Arab for years and a Jewish group sub leased it from The church that owned the building disapproved and legal action was started to revoke the sub The media however made it look like Jewish vigilantes were stealing Church property in Jerusalem by The stereotypes that pervade our culture create cognitive illusions that reify those Therefore any claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless The damage has already been done by the press in the above It is not surprising by now of course that many decent people regard the press with utmost suspicion If such a claim is cross posted to a news group in which it has not been documented before such as a reference should be given the first time it Now that the claim has been documented I regard the whole episode as disgusting and Especially so because the official who failed to provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians was probably Jewish and as a Jew I know that he should have known You appear to be referring to Moshe How do you know that the evicted Jordanians were not provided with something else In fact this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did not own but received compensation for their loss anyways Woe to Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them by force with ethnic cleansing of any remaining Jews is disgusting and shameful Jake Livni Ten years from now George Bush will American Occupied New York have replaced Jimmy Carter as the My opinions only employer has no standard of a failed
