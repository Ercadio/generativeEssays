From shaig Shai Guday Subject Re Israel an Apartheid State Not In article Joseph Askew writes In article shaig Shai Guday writes In article Joseph Askew writes If you examine these I am sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power base that his Jewish counterpart Right Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long And in all that time NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a Ministry This is about as likely as sprouting wings and flying to What basis do you have for explaining this odd failure You seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you know why are you sure It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting as much as HOW they have been Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab Lo and behold you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum I worked within the labor party during the late 's elections not this last one as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates At the time the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab by their own Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition members do the same Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in the face of years of discriminatory practise Quite simply if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted they would be able to command more than of the This is a power base that can not be ignored Especially when they are not ranked high in the party once again due to lack of political power I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that as in most political situations the MKs act out of their own self And to answer your question I broke with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right wing and ultra orthodox coalition From The OTHER Front July Translation of Ha'aretz Racism in the Knesset This attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeply embossed upon people's hearts holds that there are Knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of We are not speaking here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial The proof one of the compromises proposed was that MK Mahamid an Arab Yigal should be replaced by Tamar Gojanski a Jew Yigal from the same It was not the member's party which was considered unfit but his Fair My take on the matter and I will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy If he was sitting on the committee then someone else obviously would not In drumming up support for his seat MK would not be averse to using this argument or it could be used on his As to the proof presented in this article I would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter stands was Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions and groundless A TEST OF SELF CONFIDENCE By Gid'on Levi Ha'aretz July But not to worry even now the Jewish mind is contriving The new Committee Chair Roni Milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his Thus he will decide where it is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where A solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the For the record Roni Milo is a brash MK self described from the Likud note NOT LABOR Quite frankly I don't think anything he would say could surprise Annoy and aggravate yes surprise Do you accept that as documentation Yes I do and thank you for providing I would be most interested in knowing how things turned Shai Guday Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer Thinking Machines the winged ninja of the Cambridge MA
