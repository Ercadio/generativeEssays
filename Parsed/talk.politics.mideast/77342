From Tim Clock Subject Re Peace Talks In article Peter Garfiel Freeman writes In article Tim Clock writes In article Alan Stein writes It seems that to keep the peace talks going Israel has to keep making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture while Palestinian Arabs continue to go around hunting You know that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is only going to generate flames not Try adding some substance to the issue of gestures you What is it you feel that Israel has offered as a gesture What would you realistically expect to see presented by the Arabs Palestinians in the way of gesture Timbo Israel has not been recognized as a state by the Arabs except for Egypt of Isn't that a gesture What has Israel offered Well it has been calling for peace talks for years asked for economic relations and asked for diplomatic What else is there Would you have Israel sacrifice its security Nay I think Peace Pete Yea I think not Israel's issue is Security so any outcomes of negotiation certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this The problem is is defining by outsiders by Israel and by the Arabs themselves what is the issue to the Arab Is it Palestinian statehood is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be allowed to exist is it that the existence of a self governing non muslim state in the Islamic World is Just as the dividing line between Israel fighting for security and Israel fighting to expand is often hard to discern by outsiders especially to the Arab world so the rationale behind the Arab struggle to undermine Israel in any way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being wronged that still values peace who knows Anyway in these talks what gestures would you think would be seen by Israel as substantial Tim Clock Graduate student UCI tel Department of Politics and Society fax University of California Irvine Home tel Irvine CA
