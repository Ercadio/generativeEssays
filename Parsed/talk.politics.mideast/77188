From friedman ishay Subject Re The Israeli Press In article alcor ILYESS BDIRA writes Mark Ira Kaufman writes for your information on Since I read both American media and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going Of course you never read Arab media I read Arab ISRAELI Post and this network is more than enough The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media One that caters to outsiders for the most part anyways If you never read Ha'aretz Maariv or other Hebrew langauge papers or at least seen some of their articles translated you are not really getting the Israeli and Western American French and British reports and I can say that if we give Israel and Arabs on the bias scale of course you can switch the polarities Israeli newspapers will get either a or American leading newspapers and TV news range from Inlcuding some of the left leaning ones to yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis A to a Is that why stations such as PBS have run shows which do not depict the Israeli standpoint at all IS that why the Intifada got more coverage in and than did Saddamn gassing Kurds by the thousands The Montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers British I am from I read the Did they ever advocate the Kahane stupidity of expelling the Arabs Are they racist The Suburban has some columnists that explain the Israeli They are nothing like IN any case the Suburban is a paper with a minor local distribution and no range from neutral to French that Iknow of of course range from Afro french magazines to Arab official media range from to Egyptian to in Why no Because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since they are doing As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media here in But they still report events about which people here know I choose to form my opinions about Israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or the average bias of what you read would be probably around while that of the average American would be the same if they do not read or read the new york times and similar News makers and if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased so you are not better So what source is the closest thing to a zero IShay
