From Subject RE Jews Islam Frankenstien Some of your article was cut off on the right margin but I will try and answer from what I can In article Kaveh Smith writes I have found Jewish people very imagentative and Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and In other words Judaism has fathered both Now Islam has turned against its father I may It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the I thought the idea of believing on one God was to Unite all man How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God the God of Ebrahim are killing each other Is this like Frankenstien's story How are you going to stop this from happening How are you going to deal with so many Nuking them would distroy the whole world Would God get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same God same heaven and the same hell after all What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga Judaism did not father We had many of the same prophets but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ who Christians and Muslims believe in and The idea of believing in one God should unite all However note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non Christians and non Muslims are stated in each Man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the The praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates God does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that God will help him when he Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion So they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their Muslims have to pay percent of their income to the I guess the rabie gets his cut too We are supposed to pay of our income after all necessities are Please note that this is on a personal basis if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world Also this money is not required in the human sense a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today Is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over How can we stop another religious killing field under poor Gods name What are your thoughts Do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late on the side Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina Why would God go to top of the mountain He created the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies heavens Why God kept coming back to Middle East Was it because they created God through their imagination Is that why Jewish people were told by God they were the chosen ones God's presence is certainly on Earth but since God is everywhere God may show signs of existence in other places as We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not Profit Mohammad was married to She was a She taught him how to She probably taught him about Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah sp old testement Do you think God wrote Quran Makeh was a trade city before Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business Is that why God has put his house in there The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Muslims believe that the Taurah the Bible and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message thus the many However the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator s The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in Therefore we know that mankind has not changed its It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's I think this religious stuff has gone too All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise Look at David Koresh how that turned out I am afraid in the bigger scale the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending Only God knows for sure how it will turn I hope it won't but if that happens it was the will of Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others There is one earth One life and one Let's all man kind be good toward each God help us Peace Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you And yes may God help us Steve
