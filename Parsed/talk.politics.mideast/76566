from steve birnbaum subject re rejoinder questions to israelis in a previous article, tsiel ohayon says i agree with all you write except that terrorist orgs. were not shelling
>israel from the golan heights in 1982, but rather from lebanon. the golan
>heights have been held by israel since 1967, and therefore the plo could
>not have been shelling israel from there, unless there is something i am
>not aware of. oops...small mistake. thanks for mentioning it. i just read on
the.israel.line that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week and some children were killed. i guess the terrorists must have gotten by
the security zone. just think at how much more shelling would be happening if the security zone weren't there.
l8r... steve
