From ILYESS BDIRA Subject Re The Israeli Press Mark Ira Kaufman writes for your information on Since I read both American media and Israeli media I can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about Israel does not have a true picture of what is going Of course you never read Arab media I read Arab ISRAELI Post and this network is more than enough and Western American French and British reports and I can say that if we give Israel and Arabs on the bias scale of course you can switch the polarities Israeli newspapers will get either a or American leading newspapers and TV news range from to yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis The Montreal suburban a local free newspaper probably is closer to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers British range from neutral to French that Iknow of of course range from Afro french magazines to Arab official media range from to Egyptian to in Why no Because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since they are doing As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased of course they Some may lean to the right or the left just like the media here in But they still report events about which people here know I choose to form my opinions about Israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or the average bias of what you read would be probably around while that of the average American would be the same if they do not read or read the new york times and similar News makers and if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased so you are not better
