> > napoleon are you one of those people who were born when istanbul was called konstantinopolis? i don't think so! if those people use it because
they are used to do so, then i understand. but open any map
today (except a few that try to be political) you will see that the name of the city is printed as istanbul. so, don't try to give
any arguments to using konstantinopolis except to cause some
flames, to make some political statement. --
