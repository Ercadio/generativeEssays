From shaig Shai Guday Subject Re was Go Hezbollah In article Brad Hernlem writes In article Tim Clock writes Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel should totally back down easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there is more to the shelling of the it is called GETTING BACK GETTING EVEN It doesn't make sense to shell the The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of If you recall a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment the topic arose When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will aiding them has he violated his civilian status What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti Israel guerillas in residence If Israel is not willing to accept the word of others then IMHO it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued Afterall Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during Tim you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been Hezbollah remains the only independent Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi his wife and young Of course if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do Furthermore with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be That is not exactly The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of It has Without the support and active involvement of Syria Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border Not lately eh Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory not on Israeli troops in Lebanon Please note the distinction in the past two True but the Syrians did allow until at least guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might Shai Guday Stealth bombers OS Software Engineer Thinking Machines the winged ninjas of the Cambridge MA
