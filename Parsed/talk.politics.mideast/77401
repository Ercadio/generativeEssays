existence since We continued to be in existence until the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the area Thereafter, we signed with the British in a protective agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security of Kuwait '' In , the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today Such an agreement was reconfirmed in between the Kuwaiti government and the Iraqi government at that time That is when Iraq became a state, after Kuwait itself '' In , when we declared our independence Iraq seized the opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq There were threats The British came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait In , Kuwait and Iraq again signed border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait '' Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi Origins of Kuwait The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b Ghurair of the Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence The beginning of Kuwait goes back to the late th century and some historians go further up to Kuwait's name is derived from al Kut which means fortress Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a horn or hill Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment The 'Utub, al Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait during the early th century They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until After that, they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub Carsten Niebuhr a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia He was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in by the King of Denmark to Arabia He documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf and in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain Niebuhr's chart of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia pub Al Sabah 'Utub kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between , there was no Ottoman rule on the region In the second half of the th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia In fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged Their attempts to restore their lost position in al Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in , and Ali Pasha's expedition against the Wahhabis in , were unsuccessful At Kuwait, the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control The aim of 'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf '' p Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra did not affect Kuwait '' p Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the Gulf area Independent Kuwait This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al Qatif Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours In relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area, the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone Kuwait, which was not a party to the above mentioned treaty of , was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies For more details about the mentioned expedition, please check out the source of the above text The Modern History of Kuwait, , by Ahmed Abu Hakima, McGill University, Canada Independent Kuwait This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, Iraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al Zuhair tribe in Zubair In , trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was purchased by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam representative on the basis of a claim by the Al Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n e Sufiyya At the same time, Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory It should be recalled that the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants Abdulla Ibn Sabah, the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father's agent in the case, narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive Eventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali Governor of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered him the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined Nevertheless, the proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's title to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi Amir '' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as explained above However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them Source The Modern History of Kuwait, , by Ahmed Abu Hakima, McGill University, Canada Independent Kuwait This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans When Pelly Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf visited Kuwait for the first time on March , , he was met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh Sabah Just before he reached Kuwait town on March , he was met by Sheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to a very good home,'' which had been prepared for Pelly and his companions Scarcely had we entered it,'' says Pelly, when Sheikh Sabah himself came '' This description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by Pelly The Government is patriarchal,'' says Pelly, the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee Qadi the judicial departments The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee's decision '' Punishment was rarely inflicted Indeed, there seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an army '' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the country, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him When my father was nearly years old, he called me and said, I shall soon die I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, but I have made many and true friends, grapple them While other states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill government, mine has gone on flourishing Hold to my policy, and though you are surrounded by desert, and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper '' Source The Modern History of Kuwait, , by Ahmed Abu Hakima, McGill University, Canada Independent Kuwait This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a good friend,'' but in October , an event took place at Kuwait which could have weakened those good relations On October , Lieutenant Edmunds, the Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr in Iran , arrived in Kuwait on a special mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell His mission was to find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the Mediterranean The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay The salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh After Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not to ill will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British Therefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the British If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so also did the Egyptians Earlier in the same year, some of the most wanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the Wahhabi general in Al Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al Duwaish, sought refuge in Kuwait Protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah This can, therefore, be looked upon as an indication of self confidence an outcome of Kuwait's independence from foreign powers It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors This defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time As to Kuwait's position between and , one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians Relations with the British and even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms Source The Modern History of Kuwait, , by Ahmed Abu Hakima, McGill University, Canada They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands The Kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle the dispute the old fashioned way Are you really this cartoonish Or do you seriously believe this If so, please post your proof Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq together and concentrated on taking out Saddam A strong, united Iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf Are standards at UWisc dropping Since when has Iraq ever had an elected government
