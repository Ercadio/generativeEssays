it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet Al Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three In relation to this a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war Kuwait which was not a party to the above mentioned

favor of the Sheikh of The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side

attempts to cause a confrontation with It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's title to Sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi '' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair Kuwait had had other
