From Srinivas Sunder Subject Re The Stage is Being Set In article writes After reading plenty of categorical remarks claiming the arrival of the restoration of colonialismo could anyone define colonialismo indicate what colonial countries remain indicate what changes indicate that there is a restoration in the making I'll leave questions and to be answered elsewhere but on question something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might Namely that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to establish a police force for I didn't hear any thing that said that the current of Haiti asked for it nor is there any real precedent barring Somalia for the UN getting involved in internal That might also answer question The neo colonial countries are a diffuse lot the UN Security Council And while I am at it I'll take a stab at the new colonialism as defined in most articles I have read would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Council democracy aid education free markets free press and then out for the colonialists now assured that there is a civilized country that they have left Note I don't support this idealized concept simply because I think it is a lot of Srinivas Sunder If The University of Illinois shares these views I'd be They aren't that smart generally
