From Shaqeeqa Subject Re Binyamin Netanyahu on CNN In article nabil writes Arab leaders don't have to cheat they are actually allowed to have four Are you implying above that Arab leaders are gays Aren't there Jewish gays too Arab leaders are now following by Islamic rules Or is it only applicable in cases like this I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife Saddam also has a Assad's brother has a wife and several mistresses and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have within their lifetimes wives in the double digitas only they manage to keep four at a time This is all It takes a lot more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse' himself by making such a public Does the average secular Israeli care though The Mossad probably applauded
