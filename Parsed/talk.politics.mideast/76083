From Bob Blackshaw Subject Re No humanity in Bosnia In Mubashir Rizvi writes It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my recieved a couple of letters too some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern who contest this statement present the figures of the World War we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it today is the matter not of the POWER but of the seems to be that what we lack is the The idea of the or any other nation taking action military intervention in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who advocate such After the belligerants are subdued it would require an occupation force for one or two If you will stop and think about it you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury they have imbibed hatred with their mother's If we stop the fighting seize and destroy all weapons they will simply go back to killing each other with And the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to A price I am unwilling to even Second point of difference which makes it different from the holocast sp is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event There is no valid comparison to the All of the Jewish people that I have known as friends were not brought up to To be wary of others most certainly but not to And except for the Warsaw uprising they were unarmed and even in Warsaw badly out gunned It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's Suppose we do this thing what will you tell the parents wives children lovers of those we are sending to die That they gave their lives in some noble cause Noble cause separating some mad dogs who will turn on Well I will offer you some Suppose we tell them that they have one week this will give foreign nationals time to leave to cease their At the end of that week bring in the Tomahawk firing ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian Perhaps when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden attack of Send in missiles by all means but do not send in today inspite of all the might the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which By all means lift the is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the indirecltly and possibly unintentionally mankind has sided with the this I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern Which killers Do you honestly believe they are all on one side REB
