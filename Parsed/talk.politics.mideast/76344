From Steve Birnbaum Subject Re Questions to Israelis In a previous article Center for Policy Research says Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told namely that hundreds of thousands of non Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews who also left for example to Europe to avoid the clashes were allowed to How can you justify such discrimination if this is true Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured these Arabs could return to their former homes reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to When the Arabs lost Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as What would you have done Let them in so they could kill Jews Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli I wonder how many and There is very little evidence available about As much as I know many Arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any employees unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants hotels etc if there weren't enough people ON the kibbutz to do In such cases they are paid If a kibbutz turns away an Arab have never seen or heard of this but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz not the whole kibbutz to keep it what way' I am certain that if only religious communities in the would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate But Israel has always been ruled by a secular Your answer is not This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli Although the major parties in Israel aren't religious however not totally secular due to the format of the government coalition the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority In fact from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel CANNOT be called a secular For instace Haifa is the only city in the country except for maybe some Arab cities where buses run on the Jewish There are many other examples of religion in Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state but by Rabbis and Obviously your disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much Steve Internet Fidonet M My opinions are not associated with anything including my
