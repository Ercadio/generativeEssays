From Akgun Subject Re Turkey Cyprus Bosnia Serbia Greece Armenia Azeris In article Michalis Syrimis writes any concentration labor camp in Turkey around or later for Cypriot Greeks or any Greeks rather than talking nonsense like above I will be glad to read what they How can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps Akgun Living through those days at the age of and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and In Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that Forget about internal news agencies I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in However I heard Adana POW It was not secret and well recognized POW As for all the registered prisoners to the Red Cross having returned to their homes this is your version of the There are cases in which prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their relatives were not These are undeniable I see They vanished in Turkish labor Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing Is that it What do you think happened to them I thought that MIA's are only the subject of Rambo and Chuck Noris Seems that I am As for their treatment being according to what Okay we believe You don't need to belive Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history It has been a respected and continuous member of UN since the inception of No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in and Only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the internal Greek I know what you would say Let me answer it before wasting Yes UN had a few condemning resolutions against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem especially after the Well US and Israel had a few What can I say I am sure during Athens Junta duruing Greeks had their own share closed matter today between Turkish Cypriots Turks Greeks Greek There is no more any official demand from Greek Cypriots about any missing Greek Where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating was there I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International He keeps saying that This was no longer an issue for peace Also you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words that Argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a Greek Cypriot Seems that there is a different opinions among Greek Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish Your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup d'eta and the invasion days is simply not All the cases of missing persons I know and I know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish I am not claiming I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July and the final cease fire in late August This answer seems to satisfy the international community the UN and the Vasilu Goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks Also I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek Are you BTW do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events As of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a There are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others in the prison camp in Like I said There is even a different opinion among Greek Cypriots for this The officers in Turkish Army who governed the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks I hope Turkish Army does't have same type of morons for the security of However this must a good subject for a movie One should inform Oliver Stone about Of course The justice was served If and when the Bosnian pleas are answered who's going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing They are known today as EOKA B masterminds were known in to everybody and are doing it openly even giving TV It may take same time as it was for the EOKA B case however the justice will be served Akgun comparing the actions of the Serbians in Bosnian with the actions of Turkey in Cyprus is not something I would do if I were a I thought that the Serbians were the savages the inhumane beasts etc Akgun Michalis Syrimis If this is what you understood from the paragraph above you better let your computer system administrator check the character conversion tables in your If yours are OK I should inform mine Akgun
