shall tell what happened on February That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square where about people had There were Komsomol members there and Pioneers Children's organization and there were both Party members and non Party people there as All of them were shouting There's no room for Christians here and When we finish with the Armenians we'll go after the Russians And some even cried Out Death to the Armenians Absurd rumors had been circulating about I became I came home breathless and told about everything I had seen My family couldn't believe My father in law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian wasn't home he was at an Azerbaijani By eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a He got out of the car but there was no one Well I was telling him everything too and he said What is there no longer any government That same day Igor said Papa something terrible is happening in the And he said We'll stay at home no one will drive us from our own The day On February that was Sunday we didn't go We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions and they all said the same Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring Ira my brother in law's wife and I called the police they're wrecking a car We called and called and nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do On February on Monday even though there were troops in the city we were afraid to go to I called the school I had the keys to the I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys I wouldn't be coming He agreed and even said Fine don't come in we understand what's going on in town don't come Before that on the the Ambartsumian family came They came to my father in law and said Uncle Sergey they broke our windows bad things are happening in Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said With my own eyes I saw them chasing naked girls through the I don't know he said we should leave Well on the we were already trying to decide where we should go thinking we'd go to our We got a couple of bags together clothes food the bare And then somewhere around the building manager came by and said Uncle Sergey the situation in town is bad don't go My father even opened up to him and said Maybe we'll drive to the dacha it'll be safer No he said it'll be worse there you'll be safer at He said don't be afraid if something happens I'll send people to save After he left about minutes passed and about people burst into our All of us were at home at the time Igor and I and our two children Ira and Edik and their daughter my sister in law Ira and my mother and father in And the Ambartsumian family there were three of them Uncle Misha Zhasmen and their daughter Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us Go in that room and close the Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone The children started Suddenly Ira my brother in law's wife suggested Let's run out onto the We the two daughters in law and the children and Zhasmen and Marina raced out onto the My sister in law and my mother in law ran in and said Quick over to the other balcony or they'll kill you We lived on the second We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor' At first we couldn't manage The balcony looked onto the At that time people were coming home from work and many just stood there I pleaded and begged Please call someone have someone come I even started I'll throw down the children I'll throw them down you catch them and take them somewhere so at least the children will Either they were afraid or I don't know They looked as though they were watching a Some of them started throwing stones at I'll say it again these weren't the bandits these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway they were just regular people A bus even I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other Ira my sister in law helped us get the children over I was pregnant about seven months No it wasn't yet seven it was six and a I climbed over I think Zhasmen went first you know I just don't remember it all that Zhasmen went first I think and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children and they were all screaming and My Kristina said Mamma don't throw us over the balcony we're afraid Lilia was crying and Kristina and Seryozha were crying Kristina didn't even want to climb She shouted I'm staying with Grandmother I'm staying with Grandma She loved her grandma more than she loved And my mother in law shouted Oh no Kristina's still there she's still there save Kristina too Ira helped us climb over with Kristina coming Ira helped us and went back We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony I pounded with my fist Sevil open the door open it please She didn't open No go away go anywhere go I'm not opening the She was our neighbor we were friends we never refused her anything ever And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows and she opened the She opened it and said Karina Karina go away go anywhere just don't stay here they'll kill us too because of I begged Please at least take the children we'll leave we'll go No she said you have to Her sons ran in one had a Sevil's brother he's around shouted at us Get out of here leave I'll kill you with this knife I became terrified I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few I went down and heard a It was in the courtyard The Armenians must be killed they've taken all the best places all the best apartments One of them said Let the Armenian blood flow none of them should survive When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on No one opened their door for me Not on the third floor or the I couldn't see Zhasmen any Ira came upstairs I even thought that they had let her stay that they would save My head was They were killing my family and here I was in the next entryway with two Seryozha was four and Kristina was five and a They were crying Mamma we're scared They were so frightened that I didn't even know how to calm them should I try to calm them or myself It was But on the third floor a man did open his I asked Open up let me inside He opened the door slightly and said No No and that was it He said it so sternly No I went up to the fifth I pounded my fists on the door with all my He opened up the man of the house and stood there looking at I was ready to get down on my I almost did get down on my Please I beg of you at least take the He wasn't an Azerbaijani he was a I don't even know how but he let me And when I went in Zhasmen was already Two minutes hadn't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the Lilia was He didn't want to open the And again I started pleading Please open the door it's our Ira and Lilia Open the door And he said No I'm I said again and again Please open the door please He looked at He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after Ira came in with We threw ourselves into each other's arms Then the man locked us into the We sat there for a long Through the door he told us Calm the children and calm yourselves down Calm down This man was hiding us but what of our family When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this I said Igor Edik let's say And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say is that some kind of joke All the same I thought they would kill all of Igor looked at me too But it was already too late They started pounding on the door Igor was standing next to the Before that he had told us Go lock yourselves in that room and sit He thought we were in the But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them Edik Igor let's say Igor didn't think we could climb over to the other And we did get over there and I myself can't believe we were able to save Igor put on a helmet and Edik had his coat on and he put on a fur All the men Igor Edik their father and Misha Ambartsumian they all stood next to the They thought they would pound on it a while and But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani Open the door We were all silent Someone outside the door said They're home they're in there break down the door And I remember my father in law whispering They're going to break it down now it's coming down now He had something in his hands I think it was a knife if they got in we were going to defend In the hall near the door there were two metal chair From outside the door they said We're counting to five open up But we were all quiet we didn't answer We made like no one was We figured they'd leave they'd get tired and My father in law had said It's not possible they'd come into my How can that be Everyone knows us all of Sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani guest at our We had a nice dacha everyone would get together there often Azerbaijanis liked being with us there But now we had to save ourselves we had to flee from our own Ira I remember said I'm not leaving here my brothers and my parents are here I'm going to fight alongside That's just what she She picked up a knife and said If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight alongside my family I'm not going We were at Sevil's when they broke into our We heard fighting and The noise was And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the Lezgin's apartment you could hear everything up there Even Ira's I remember her calling her mother several She called her for a long time I started pounding on the door in the bathroom Open the door what are they doing to Ira who's shouting that's Ira shouting that's her voice But the Lezgin said It's nothing calm down no it's not in your He was lying to me so I'd calm Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said Karina Igor got away calm He ran He saw Igor break away and run off with his own They killed him outside next to the While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human The way Ira shouted She shouted Save me Mamma save me Mamma Mamma She repeated it several There was a wild There were very many people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling whistling you just can't imagine what was going on what the roar was Apparently after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth I don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters in law were climbing over the And after we heard Ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the I thought those were our last moments and started saying good bye to my children kissing They were I woke them up Kristina Seryozha wake up And I tell Ira Ira if something happens we'll throw ourselves off the We were on the fifth Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door too because later he said I opened the door and told them there were no Armenians And after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see they were We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from the But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding The Lezgin let us out of the They had a candle He said Karina there're no lights on in our The whole block was dark the whole block It's a huge block The Lezgin said I'm afraid to keep you until morning I'm afraid of the neighbors they might kill me for saving I said What are you saying we'll leave But we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the Give us time to find somewhere else to He said Well OK go I asked Ira Ira do you want to go Ira said No I'll stay with the children I said Fine then I'll Zhasmen and I went downstairs It was very No one was in the It was dark pitch l was afraid to go out at after seven Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home I never went out And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that It was probably after Later I called the boarding school and my director He said Karina where are you I didn't know I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I I got confused and hung up the From him I only found out what time it was I asked him What time is it He said I think but I don't really So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the I look and see what appears to be a person not far from our And there was the smell of something I became I looked at the corpse for a long It was either Ira or I only saw one of them Zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it Hurry up let's go Hurry up come on what are you turning around for I turned around and saw a large truck it must have belonged to the bandits because they came to kill us in a truck like We lived in the third entryway and that truck was next to the We walked quickly holding I thought if I go to the police then they'll put me I couldn't count on Before I reached the police station I saw a military We went over and I said Soldier in Block I don't know if they've killed people or injured them we need to save them And he said Go to the police station and tell them I said I'm afraid to go there I'm afraid of He said Don't be We went to the police and they wrote down the address and the military vehicle went to our I didn't go with them they left me at the police I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them I didn't know where they were or what had happened to After a while they brought my children and Ira and First they took us to the KGB that was at two or three in the Then around five they took us to the City Party Committee and there were very many people there very I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a Seryozha was only wearing a shirt and Kristina had a little dress No coat no boots nothing And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party The Lezgin had told me that Igor And I thought that he was probably But then after two and a half days they took us the Armenians of Sumgait to On March some people from the Central Committee came and told us Karina Ira we need you come with us to the City Party My Mamma had come to Nasosny and she had been looking for me for six Mama my brothers and my We went to the City Party Committee and waited there in the I was wearing nothing but a dress and Ira had only a dress on as There was a strong wind on March An hour went And then one of the functionaries told us Karina Ira gather your Would you like to go to the burial I said What did they really kill all of them He said Let's He had a long list and he started reading them off Igor Melkumian my husband Eduard Melkumian my brother in law Irina Melkumian my sister in law Sogomon Melkumian my father in law and Raisa Melkumian my mother in He read off all their names and said Get in the car let's go to the We buried our I couldn't believe it at the time I couldn't conceive of it or imagine it And even now I think how shall I explain it to my children when they're older My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother they spoiled Kristina would always announce My grandma is better than anyone Now even though she is getting used to my mother it's difficult for her and once she told her You're a bad I don't know why I asked her Kristina where's Papa and she said They killed She knows she understands it And recently I scolded Seryozha severely for something and he started shouting at me When Papa comes I'm going to tell him everything July Nairi Boarding House Near the Village of Arzakan Hrazdan District Armenian SSR reference The Sumgait
