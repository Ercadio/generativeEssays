From Alberto Adolfo Pinkas Subject Re Israel An Apartheid In article perlman Eric Perlman writes I believe that Zionism as it is is a form of By as it is I mean not the fact that is nacionalism but the specific ideas it supports the form it defines what a Jew is and the way it wants to accomplish its It has nothing to do with It has everything to do with We've dealt with with your arguments about history before on this net suffice it to say you haven't succeeded in convincing anyone probably because of their lack of I do not want to convince This is just USENET not the real I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes I present my I think that this net is only useful to exchange I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of Now if you want to deal with what certain people say that is But by condemning the movement which is NOTHING more than Jewish nationalism and NEVER HAS BEEN anything more than that you are saying quite literally that it is racist to think that Jews your own people it should be added have the right to a state in their homeland the same right every other nation If you don't agree with that I suggest you read a Because your interpretation is just plain inconsistent with that dictionary definition as well as modern First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the right to have a State is Zionism as a movement is more than just that I think that Zionism in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racist In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right Here's where you're Here's also where you should know you're Zionism is in no way Never has Approaches to Zionism are as widespread as the ideologies of Hashomer Hatzair and Meir Some of those approaches ARE racist Kahane for But every approach to Zionism defines those goals differently and also defines a different approach to those The single commonality is the belief that Jews like every other nation on Earth deserve their own That is what makes the basis for Zionist However I am not considering just that but the rest of As long as Zionism considers for example who is a Jew in a Jewish State based on religion I will consider Zionism a form of As you well know over of Israeli Jews are secular in other words they are in no way religious and most probably don't even believe in G Which makes an interesting People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown us that there are some problems in a State where of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non Jews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a religious definition Maybe I would consider hypocrisy to support Zionism and disregard the right to self determination of the Palestinian people and their struggle to reach If you'd wanted to say that in the first place you should have said it I took you at your In other words I took your words to have their normal dictionary It is now quite obvious that you use a different dictionary than the rest of the English speaking world and that you base your analysis on According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary Merriam Webster Inc Publishers Springfield Massachusetts page hy poc ri sy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is If you are really interested on what I think instead of directly coming with labels like hypocrat send me a mail to and we can exchange How about learning what your words mean for once I stand by what I've I know what my words I do stand by what I said I believe Zionism is a form of Of course I tend to talk about things as they are and not as they are defined in a broad Eric Perlman Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy University of Colorado Boulder AAP
