From Vedat Dogan Message ID In article David Davidian writes In article Vedat Dogan wrote in response to article David Davidian writes Source Adventures in the Near East by Rawlinson Jonathan Cape Bedford Square London First published pages DD Such a pile of garbage First off the above reference was first published DD in NOT and has pages NOT Second upon checking page DD we are asked to believe VD No VD It was first published IN I have the book on my desk now VD VD and furthermore the book I have does not have pages either as you VD claimed has question Well it seems YOUR book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the n crap posted by o boy Please can you tell us why those quotes are crap you do not like them they really As I said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by Serdar Argic You couldn't reject In addition the Author's Preface was written on January BUT THE BOOK was published in Here we go In the book I have both the front page and the Author's preface give the same year and January respectively Anyone can check it at her his library if not I can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct I really don't care what year it was first published or What I care about is what the book writes about murders tortures the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these your groundless accussations DD I can provide postings if required to verify my claim VD what is new I will post a file but I am not going go through the effort to show there is some Turkish modified re publication of the book like last time I claim I have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in Serdar Argic's Reference couldn't reject now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting Let's see how you lie from 'non existing' quotes to re publication First you said there was no such a quote in the given called Serdar Argic a liar I said to you NO there exactly existed such a I even gave the call number page could't reject And now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim am sure that you have some 'pretty well suited theories' as usual And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and 's also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are R and the page numbers to verify the quotes and It is not possible that 's text has pages mine has and yours has Now are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying it is not not what is your point Differences in the number of pages Mine was published in Argic's was in No need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc does it give you an idea The issue was not the number of pages the book the year first And you tried to hide the whole the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by those quotes given by Serdar Argic exist It was the issue wasn't it you were not able to object it bother you anyway You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still has so many craps in the Any question Hovig Heghinian Hmm Turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to lose count around Well apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a I will dissect article by article paragraph by paragraph line by line lie by lie revision by revision written by those on this net who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un redressed We are neither in x Soviet Union nor in some similar ultra nationalist fascist dictatorship that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic Also feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA SDPA ARF terrorists the Armenian pseudo scholars or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal Armenian government got away with the genocide of million Turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that You and those like you will not get away with the genocide's cover Not a Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work
