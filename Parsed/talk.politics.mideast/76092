From Basil Hamdan Subject Re was Go Hezbollah In article Adam Shostack writes Tell me do these young men also attack Syrian troops In the South Lebanon area only Israeli and SLA and Lebanese troops are Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali Between the Awali river and the Security Zone only Lebanese troops are with the blood of its If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR There must be a guarantee of peace before this It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli I agree peace guarantees would be better for all but I am addressing the problem as it stands Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon and will include security guarantees for both My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim In my opinion if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs that's why I post to If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace then Israel would not have to be Until it is Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its As I explained I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern I also explained why I believe that to be the My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called Security Zone before the conclusion of the peace Such a move would save Israeli lives advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is Not a day Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few Its not gonna That is too Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors Because Israel is not occupying the Security Zone free of It is paying the price for Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives that is my If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions Israel would quite probably have left Unfortunately it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah and maintain the That is completely Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese The real heavy weights are Syria's The gov't is supported by The Lebanese Army is over troops and unified like never Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper especially after Israeli That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov' If Israel does withdraw and such an act Hizbolllah attacking Israel would be akin to political and moral Basil Adam Adam Shostack If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure wouldn't waste them on members of John Perry Barlow
