Azerbaijan Really people in town didn't know what was happening on February I came home from school at o'clock being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to When we left everything in town was Life was the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday my father my mother and We spent the day in Baku and on the somewhere around we got on the bus for home figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next When we were entering town near the story high rises our bus was stopped by a very large The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the The driver says that there are no Armenians on board then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people We get off the bus but are not taken for We set out in the direction of At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from Block to the These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as Then we decided to go home Near the story high rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways Death to the Armenians was written on the When we came into the courtyard we live in an L shaped building it was still We went on upstairs but didn't turn on any We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on Wednesday not to Then there was a knock at the It was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their We went down to their place and they led us to the They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten she ran away Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right that's what the Armenians deserve because in Stepanakert allegedly people were being killed girls from Agdam had been We didn't stay very long in the We tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron Papa watched and said things now and He said that there was a fire near Building probably a car on Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the They appeared from the side of the building where I later found out a woman had been The woman who ran away naked Yuri Avakian was killed When the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait but there was no We decided she had already We sat at The phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my I called him to the It was Jeykhun Mamedov from my father's work He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the To be quite honest Papa didn't want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told Some minutes after the call a crowd ran into our Bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment They came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the Armenians They came into our We tried to resist but there was nothing we could One of them took my parents' passports and began to read He read the surname Danielian turned the page read Armenian and that alone was enough to doom He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with Another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has They had knives and steel I had a knife in my Unfortunately I didn't use I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the Then one of them commanded that we be taken One person was giving When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle and my mother was behind Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster I let her go ahead of me and fell in behind When he tried to push me I hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents I realized that resistance was completely We are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen The crowd surrounds At first they strike me and I'm knocked out when I come to they beat me again I lose consciousness often I don't see or hear my parents since I was the first one hit and was out When I come to I try to pick them up they are lying next to The crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their That's I try to pick them up but can' My left arm is I start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an The bodies of my parents are still We were attacked at around o' I regain consciousness at about and try to make it up the stairs home When I knock at the neighbors' door they push me back and tell me to go I go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she sends her son off for one and takes me to our I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but I can't see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be But they were still Later at in the morning as I found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already If they received attention on time it is possible they would still be Later around o'clock on the policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some They call an ambulance and minutes later it arrives and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my At o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people all of them The hospital was nearly overflowing with The only

the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia return it to
