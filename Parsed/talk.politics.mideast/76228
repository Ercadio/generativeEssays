From Ken Arromdee Subject Re American Jewish Congress Open Letter to Clinton In article CASPER PPE writes I must say I was appalled by the American Jewish Council's open America is not the world's We cannot and should not take it upon ourselves to solve the problems of the entire America's young men and women should not be sent to Yugoslavia If people feel strongly enough let them go as individuals to fight alongside the butchers of their We have a volunteer The argument you gave only applies if we have a Huh Sorry I misread your remark about young men and Though I am now unsure what that sentence does Furthermore people do not become butchers by being ethnic cleansed Or do you automatically call them butchers because they are Muslim I am disappointed in your logic especially coming from a stalwart of You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the butchers of their choice Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of ethnic cleansing you imply that such Muslim victims are People become butchers by There have been atrocities on all This implies both sides are True it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim but that does not mean that victims do not Would you in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans These people have been butchering each other for When one side wins and gets what it wants it will Yes but both sides want different The Muslims chiefly want to not be ethnic cleansed The Serbians want to ethnic cleanse the It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants but the things that the two sides want are not Quite an impressive leap of reasoning to assume that I am so racist as to call someone a butcher because they are In fact I think on the contrary the media fixation on this war as opposed to the dozens upon dozens of civil wars which have been fought in the recent past is because these are white people in When atrocities occur in the Third World there is not as much news coverage and not nearly the same level of I recall before we did anything for Somalia apparent left wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third worlders who Americans consider unworthy of They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the For that matter this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the After all they're Christian and the Muslims are If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us why does everyone want to help the side that is less like us Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to Leftover Turkey On the second day after Christmas my truelove served to Turkey Casserole that she made from Leftover days deleted Flaming Turkey Wings Pizza Hut commercial and M tlu A gic bait Ken Arromdee
