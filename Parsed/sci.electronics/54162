From There's a seeker born every minute Subject blinking LEDs Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate by voltage I guess If so, what hertz pulse rate are they adjustable or set to I'd like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx hz, hz, hz, or hz Something like that I'm interested in what's out there for flash rates I like the idea of LEDs with flasher circuits already in them I hate soldering ICs in general Guess I don't have a hell of a lot of patience Thanks, Dana
