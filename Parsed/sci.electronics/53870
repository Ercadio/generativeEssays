From Mark Langston Subject negative logic high This may sound like a simple minded question but this is the first time I've ever had a need for this I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things like photoresistors you know no light to photoresistor emit a logic high Anyway I've got some servos lying around and I wanted to do some things with them using digital I know all about having to pulse the signal and everything I just have one problem I'm assuming I need a negative yes negative logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic Is a negative logic high I've seen this in schematics the same thing as an active low or what I'm not using a bi polar power source so how would I get a negative logic high out of this thing I need to have all three signals available Logic high logic low and negative logic Any help would be greatly Also please reply via email as I never seem to have time to read this or any other group Thanks much mark
