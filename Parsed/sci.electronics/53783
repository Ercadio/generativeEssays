From John Hawkinson Subject Building a UV flashlight Yes I know it sounds Call it an Call it what you Just don't ask why Anyway I'd like to build a UV flashlight flashlight means it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they need a lot of power I'm not too concerned with whether it's long wave or short wave but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs I'll take both One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about near UV light being cheaper to get at than actual UV Does anyone know what he was referring to Thanks John Hawkinson
