from joel kolstad subject re dmm advice needed in article peter tryndoch writes if you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle, >etc) then i suggest you go and buy a fluke (never seen a beckman), however >for every other use you can buy a cheapie. my beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a
lab table. !@#!@$#!@$@#$ probably not indicative of anything, but i've
already filled out the requisition for a fluke 87. :-) oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count. not often, but often
enough that i want at least _one_ good meter! ---joel kolstad
