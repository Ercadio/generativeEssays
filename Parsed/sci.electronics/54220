From Shishin Yamada Subject Re help with phone wire which ones are tip ring In article Michael Levin writes I just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed in series with the tip or ring lines of the phone Which ones are those Suppose I am holding a regular phone wire such that the little plastic tooth on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead ends that you plug into the phone is facing down and away from Which of the wires that I see is the tip and which is the ring Please reply to Mike Levin Mike Ring is the RED Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard phone They two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone the two live lines They are the two innermost connectors of an RJ phone Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to GREEN ring to tip green being at ground potential of the voltmeter it should read volts in the on hook no ring position I am sure it's V and not Doesn't hurt a phone too much if they're reversed it's just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere Additionally when off hook the voltage drops to about to Volts I think it is supposed to correspond to a to mA current And lastly when ringing the two wires develop an AC potential of about V p p at to Hz across them where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from Hope that clears
