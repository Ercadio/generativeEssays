From Filip Gieszczykiewicz Subject Switching PS questions I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators and learn the black magic art of switching power before anyone flames me I KNOW both have their place Anyways I've built the basic up down converters with pretty good results efficiency but I'm running into problems when I try to design build anything that puts out serious I know it can be done I have some guts on my bench but something puzzles me I'm using a simple choke as the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose What are they for Better than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of I'd love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume My other problems in getting high amps good efficiency are Lack of sources of ideal components calculated and Limited knowledge of the whole I'm doing this on my own not school mind you in fact I have yet to take any course that covers transistors So is the answer to the accumulation of dead commercial models and truning into a scavanger not that it's not what I'm doing and getting understanding schematics and a bit more of the mind boggling theory Take My goal is in car battery out and on the other end and the distance between the two will be more than feet of gauge but less than Would like to have a working model in a year or Do I have a chance to make it Filip I'll buy a vowel Best e mail fmgst All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only so respond NOW I live for my EE major winsurfing programming SCA and assorted Drive Linux has and MS DOS has MS DOS is worried
