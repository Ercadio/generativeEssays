From Kelly Gray Subject Re Pinout needed for According to my TI databook the pinouts for the display are as follows Pin LED supply voltage Pin Latch data input B Pin Latch data input A Pin Left decimal point cathode Pin Latch strobe input Pin Omitted Pin Common ground Pin Blanking input Pin Omitted Pin Right decimal point cathode Pin Omitted Pin Latch data input D Pin Latch data input C Pin Logic supply voltage Vcc The logic supply voltage is The LED supply is also but it need not be particularly well The LED drivers on the chip use a constant current source so LED intensity is not affected by the supply o o Kelly Gray preferred
