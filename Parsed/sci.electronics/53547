From Subject Telcom wiring help I've got two lines coming into my Two different telephone When I ordered the second line installed instead of bringing out another wire bundle the telco just connected up to my yellow and black So I have one line on red green and the other on yellow Today I was monitoring the voltage on both I had a voltmeter across the red and green and read back I then lifted up the receiver on my second black yellow wires The voltage dropped to volts on the first red green wires I repeated this experiment with the second line monitoring black yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green It also dropped to Why is this I thought these were separate Next I went to the block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the block and did some resistance Both lines read I'll appreciate any help on Is this considered normal Guy Urbina U
