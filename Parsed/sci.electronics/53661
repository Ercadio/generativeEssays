From Wayne Alan Martin Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do Excerpts from Apr Re What do Nuclear Site's by R Tim From R Tim C Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do Date Fri Apr PDT In article swalker man wrote I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that this board would be most I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool Except for their size the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 's a hundred years ago for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric Basicly the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower of the To assist cooling and the draft water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot The cold water evaporates removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these That slight pinch maybe of the way up the tower is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced compared to a straight cylinder The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes as high as degrees or more from first stage hot turbine to final stage cold turbine Tim Coslet Usenet R Tim C technology domesticated natural phenomena Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot As I recall the water isn't as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive Wayne Martin
