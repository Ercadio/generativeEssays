From webb Webber AH Subject Re Adcom cheap products I want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying Adcom I have heard from alot of people though that Adcom sounds great but that the components are made cheaply and therefore won't last very The time estimates I've heard are like only or Is this true I own the Adcom power As far as I'm concerned there's no amp which can touch it at the price The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other amps in the price The whole amplifier is extremely solid with massive heat sinks and very solid If you open the amp up there are only very good quality components in and the amp seems to be designed extremely Perfect symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers one for each The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are virtually the same as those on the Classe model very I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where But if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last not with those quality components Sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly My last point I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like the or It was two years old and it still sounded like If you build an amplifier decently like the Adcom's they will sound brilliant and last a long time Just my thoughts but then I do own one of Adcom's Alan Webber The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by Apprehension creeping like a choo train up your spine Will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
