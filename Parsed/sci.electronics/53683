From Dale Ulan Subject Re what to do with old k SIMMs Daniel J Rubin writes How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular Motorola microcontrollers I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am starting to get into them for some of my projects I have several k SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as free memory in one or two of my projects that would be great One project that comes to mind is a Caller ID device that would require quite a bit of RAM to store several hundered CID records etc Assuming HC In expanded muxed mode, you could do it Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC The MMI could be used to implement this, or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row column refresh address multiplexing The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing, address multiplexing, and refresh Actually, if you wanted to use a IC, you could look at AN , which has a neat controller built in There is also the xx, I think one of those has the DRAM controller built in This one is for the DRAM, however, the has only one more address line, adding only another component or so The k SIMMs are basically or DRAM chips or their equivalent in fewer packages It can be done, just takes a bit of logic design I'm actually about to do it using a C P chip I've got k simms that's megabytes on my Apple e used to be in my '
