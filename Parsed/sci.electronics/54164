From CSHL Subject Re How to the disks copy I think a few things are being missed overall First of all anyone with a DOS manual can copy a disk or copy anything hidden files dont go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant off of a hard 'Professional' crackers aren t interested in copying They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number dialog boxes volume label checks and who knows what when it comes to computer Those people are in the minority In my experience with the world of people and software it seems that a good majority of people say will at some point copy a friend's program Gee you really oughta try this or accept a These are people who normally would buy a software package or do without but decided that just once it wouldn't The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one computer most people aren't going to spend X of computers for the same software they will just install it x of times especially things like DOS Are we having fun yet
