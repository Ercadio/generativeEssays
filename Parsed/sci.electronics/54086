From Sean Kelly Subject Question on I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip particulary a Although I don't know that much about it as I understand it there's a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks up the The question is how do you determine how many bytes the address is incremented by For example if I have code I want to be accessed at and also at say how do I move the address pointer to those positions Thanks for any Sean Kelly Sysop Amizon BBS Always looking for classic video games for the following systems Atari Atari ColecoVision Atari Intellivision Vectrex
