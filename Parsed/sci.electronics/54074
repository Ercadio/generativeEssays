From Ian Farquhar Subject Re ATARI Processors In article John West writes Ian Farquhar writes Wrong it has a For those who would like to know the was a without IRQ or NMI and with only address lines giving memory space Yes but still not a for those Same instruction set of It had one custom chip not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood the TIA sometimes known as the although most other manufacturers list that as the CIA complex interface TIA stands for Television Interface Adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware the Didn't know about it being called the thats the CIA found in the Commodore I don't believe this chip existed when the was around Yes the same number but an entirely different I should have qualified this further by stating that this was the PAL version of the TIA I am not sure that the NTSC TIA would have a different The TIA was mapped into the bottom bytes of page and shadowed in the bottom bytes of page To get an image on the screen you had to wait until the raster line your picture started at load bitmaps for this line into the 'sprite' registers tell them what x positions to take how many duplicates you wanted etc then do it all again for the next This took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the Does anyone on the net actually have details of the TIA as this is the only device I have not yet discovered details about Atari Australia when asked claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the had failed as the US head office had refused to provide to chip The likes to have ROM right at the top of memory so the had to use ROMs with active high chip selects not exactly normal so some cartriges had a in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip I saw a couple of cheaper devices with 's and a couple of resistors hooked up as a cheap Nasty but workable and cheaper than a inverter if labor costs almost
