From Richard D Warner Subject UART CPU ROM RAM subsystem This is a followup post to something I've written Several people responded with good information but I don't think I communicated exactly what I am looking I'm working on a custom I O device that will communicate with a host via RS My custom circuitry will use an or EC CPU and require about of RAM preferably FLASH RAM In looking around I see that lots of people have engineered UART CPU ROM RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I O It's been done so much that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a It just needs to use an or CPU and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that Well there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to It should have routines to send and receive bytes to from the host that utilize the hardware control lines DTR RTS DTS CTS Everything I've seen is in the and up That's too much for this I need something around The CPU has the UART built in so you're only looking at a few Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain circuitry I can use Thanks in advance for the Rich
