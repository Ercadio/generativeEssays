From Subject Re Radar detector DETECTORS In article Neal Patrick Howland From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their From my rather rusty knowledge of radio most radio receivers use a superhet circuit so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator giving a fixed intermediate frequency IF that is more easily The detector detectors work by picking up IF re radiated from your radar In Britain where one has used to pay for a TV licence there are were TV detector vans prowling the streets looking for people who hadn't paid their licence They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna and how much from the rest of the It might be worth putting the detector in a proper RF shielded Andrew Daviel Vancouver Canada finger for PGP key
