From Stan Burton Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article A writes You are probably referring to the products of Opto Diode Corp Mitchell Road Newbury Park Ca The make some amazing IRLED's The really high powered devices are arrays of , , or , LED's on a TO header The chip model puts out Watts in response to a Amp, uS pulse at a duty cycle I think these are designed as illuminators for IR vision systems Jeez, that should do it I would also be interested in the application here I work with a Dance and Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a foot wide stage from feet away Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate distances might be more interesting than my application Just a thought, you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse A Hamamatsu detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give the current position Store and collate this on a computer and you could replay the movements on the screen Interesting Stan Burton DND CRAD DRES DTD MSS AGCG DRE Suffield, Box , Medicine Hat, AB, Canada, T A K
