From Arthur N Subject Re Adcom cheap products In article C K BoK world std com Roger A Williams wrote Mike Donahue writes I do NOT know much about Adcom Mobil Audio products, but I DO know for a fact that ADCOM does NOT make its own High End Home Audio Equptment and that of it comes directly out of Tiawan Like most high volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards assembled off shore in their case, mostly in the far east Final assembly and testing are done in East Brunswick and of course you older folks on the net will remember way back when Adcom got its RAVE reviews and kudos ca or so their amp and preamp WERE not only designed here but built here in the USA then they went to mexico and then to taiwan right after their sales skyrocketed because of their Stereopile review if you have units that old look for MADE IN stickers on your unit
