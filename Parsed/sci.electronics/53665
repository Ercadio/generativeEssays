From Tim Channon Subject Re Can I use a CD analog multiplexer for digital signal As the subject says Can I use a for digital signals I don't see why it couldn't handle digital signals, but I could be wrong Anyone have any advice Thanks Yes I use HC and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it works fine In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given some pretty fast edges HC is spec'd at something like dB MHz into ohms The more complex types are generally a little slower and more resistive Plain series are not so good at handling v logic Remember that the output load is seen by the input device TC E mail or
