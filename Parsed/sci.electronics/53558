From LEEK Subject Re ADC card for computer In article you say I would like to digitize the output of a SQUID magnetometer range V to V and do digital signal processing in a computer say a Macintosh II or a I would like a good bit ADC with good linearity and a high conversion speed at least kHz preferably Other concerns Must I use an ADC external to my computer to avoid digital noise feedback into my sensitive SQUID electronics Might be a good The resolution you requested is about In order to get what you've paid for noise level better be lower than It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a Before you pay for a PC card test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave I think there is a sine wave on a Digital Domain There are possibly other low THD sources Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the That's should give you a good indication of the That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed I got the idea from MAXIM data If you can live with bit resolution I would recommend looking at the from It is a high speed complete sampling A D with DSP The input range is and it uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source The Analog design guide I got from them shows a noise They claim a max Looks pretty good for the pieces A evaluation kit is Might want to give these nice folks a or fax and for application This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own Hey you can get the as a free sample just by calling the I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC based ADC I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be throwing out your Charles Cunningham Lee Student I have no connection with MAXIM except I do in general recommend companies that give samples to students to I feel they deserve that for being nice to
