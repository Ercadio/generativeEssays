From Duane P Mantick Subject Re IR remote control receiver ab Freenet carleton ca Marc Dion writes For a project of my own, I would like to build a Infra Red Remote control receiver for regular VCRs and TVs remotes Does anybody have any info or tips on how to build such receiver In particular, a which photo detector should I use which wavelength do remotes use b which ICs or circuit should I use c any suggestions for circuit layout Please reply to this group if you wish , but as well via e mail my link to usenet is not always available I'd like to see this info as well As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two nM a bit, and or nM a bit Usually it is about nM either way The two most common I have seen were and but I have also heard of and I'm not sure that the nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference Another suggestion find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote, and go look at the SAMS photofact for it You can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well, including carrier freq specs and tone decoding specs if the system uses that Duane
