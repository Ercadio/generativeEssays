From Duane P Mantick Subject Re Long distance IR detection Stan Burton writes I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an IR emitting source at a distance of about meters more is better in daylight The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward KHz square wave with duty cycle I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give information to a pan tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED s , possibly an Optek OP or Motorola MLED Wazing would mean at least Amp current pulses At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the required Has anyone done something like this Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH IRLED This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit It will output nearly a watt mW with REAL short duty cycle times nice thing about the SFH is that it is CHEAP I got mine for about cents a piece, even though I had to buy of them BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to watts honest, WATTS I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company name The watter ain't cheap, around but if you want some power, mamamia, that's pretty hot They also have a watt, a watt and a watt device in their line, and will sell small quan to individuals If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida Phone number listed in the ETID is They seem like nice people Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices, so they might be able to help you out I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to KHz Duane
