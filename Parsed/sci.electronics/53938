From Duane P Mantick Subject Re Long distance IR detection Stan Burton writes I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an IR emitting source at a distance of about meters more is better in The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward KHz square wave with duty I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic to give information to a pan tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED s possibly an Optek or Motorola Wazing would mean at least Amp current At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the Has anyone done something like this Yeesh you WILL be nailing those May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens IRLED This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a It will output nearly a watt mW with REAL short duty cycle nice thing about the is that it is I got mine for about cents a piece even though I had to buy of BTW I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company The watter ain't cheap around but if you want some power mamamia that's pretty They also have a watt a watt and a watt device in their line and will sell small to If you are interested I can find the book at home and get the pertinent Now as for the position detector you might try ELTEC in Phone number listed in the ETID is They seem like nice Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to Duane
