From John Ott Subject Re Pinout needed for TIL In article segal corolla , Gary Segal writes I've recently picked up some TIL display chips, but I can't find any information on them It seems they are no longer made by TI, and I don't have an old enough data book It appears to have a dot matrix led display capable of showing one hex digit It is in a pin DIP package, but pins , , and are not present If you have any information on this part pinout, power requirments, functions, please send me e mail Thank You, Gary Segal Motorola Inc Cellular Infrastructure Division we are standing here only to gaze at the wind pin function led supply voltage latch data input b latch data input a left decimal point cathode latch strobe input omitted common gnd blanking input omitted right decimal point cathode omitted latch data input d latch data input c logic supply voltage v LATCH STROBE INPUT, pin , when low, the data in the latches follow the data on the latch data inputs When high, the data in the latches will not change If the display is blanked and then restored while the enable input is high, the previous character will again be displayed BLANKING INPUT, pin , When high, the display is blanked regardless of the levels of the other inputs When low, a character is displayed as determined by the data in the latches The blanking input may be pulsed for intensity modulation LATCH DATA INPUTS, pins , , , , Data on these inputs are entered into the latches when the enable input is low The binary weights of these inputs are A , B , C , D DECIMAL POINT CATHODES, pins , , These LEDS are not connected to the logic chip If a decimal point is used, an external resistor or other current limiting mechanism must be connected in series with it LED SUPPLY, pin This connection permits the user to save on regulated Vcc current by using a separate LED supply, or it may be externally connected to the logic supply Vcc LOGIC SUPPLY Vcc , pin Separate Vcc connection for the logic chip COMMON GROUND, pin , This is the vegative termnal for all logic and LED currents except for the decimal points John
