From John Ott Subject Re Pinout needed for In article Gary Segal writes I've recently picked up some display chips but I can't find any information on It seems they are no longer made by TI and I don't have an old enough data It appears to have a dot matrix led display capable of showing one hex It is in a pin DIP package but pins and are not If you have any information on this part pinout power requirments functions please send me e Thank You Gary Segal Motorola Cellular Infrastructure Division we are standing here only to gaze at the wind pin function led supply voltage latch data input b latch data input a left decimal point cathode latch strobe input omitted common gnd blanking input omitted right decimal point cathode omitted latch data input d latch data input c logic supply voltage LATCH STROBE INPUT pin when low the data in the latches follow the data on the latch data When high the data in the latches will not If the display is blanked and then restored while the enable input is high the previous character will again be BLANKING INPUT pin When high the display is blanked regardless of the levels of the other When low a character is displayed as determined by the data in the The blanking input may be pulsed for intensity LATCH DATA INPUTS pins Data on these inputs are entered into the latches when the enable input is The binary weights of these inputs are A B C D DECIMAL POINT CATHODES pins These LEDS are not connected to the logic If a decimal point is used an external resistor or other current limiting mechanism must be connected in series with LED SUPPLY pin This connection permits the user to save on regulated Vcc current by using a separate LED supply or it may be externally connected to the logic supply Vcc LOGIC SUPPLY Vcc pin Separate Vcc connection for the logic chip COMMON GROUND pin This is the vegative termnal for all logic and LED currents except for the decimal John
