From Belville Subject Re flash LEDs with sound In article There's a seeker born every writes I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response to the output from a walkman cassette How could I do this I don't want it just to turn on I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak per every beep I put on a cassette Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for the simplest circuit I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of color organ but not Let me trt to explain I'm going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette So on the tape you'd hear beep pause beep pause beep pause with speed increasing as time goes I want to synchronize an LED probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette So the LED with each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort of The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the And if there was no sound on the tape except for background his the LEDs would remain Please help Thanks Dana Try looking in a Magizine called Radio Electronics May issue page There is a circuit for a Midi Light controller Andy Andy Belville It's taken me a long time but I've fallen in Love with a beautiful
