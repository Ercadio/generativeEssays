From Bill Mayhew Subject Re Dumb Question Function Generator Output offset Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent Verify that the function generator is properly Many generators expect you to supply a ohm Go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass through ohm terminator that has a male and female BNC or whatever connector on The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out into a meg load but volt into a ohm You may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic Build an You don't have to use and I wouldn't want to use the input impedance of the device under test as part of the voltage divider to drop the input test Consider this ohm Gen ohm loaded Think about the ratio of and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltages on your You can virtually discount the loading of the Also you have the millivolt test generator you Good luck Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown OH USA phone
