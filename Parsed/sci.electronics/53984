From David Plumpe Subject Re Pink Noise In Tony Wayne writes What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment octave octave etc Thus the octave has the same amount of noise power as the White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment Hz kHz etc Thus the band has the same amount of noise power as the band both bands are wide Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a octave filter usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs Note you can't get octave by using half a octave network Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers with octave related bands as a flat line across the DaveP
