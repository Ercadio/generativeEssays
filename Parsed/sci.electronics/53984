From David Plumpe Subject Re Pink Noise In sci electronics, Tony Wayne writes What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment octave, octave, etc Thus the kHz kHz octave has the same amount of noise power as the Hz Hz octave White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment Hz, kHz, etc Thus the kHz kHz band has the same amount of noise power as the Hz Hz band both bands are Hz wide Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a db octave filter usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs Note you can't get db octave by using half a db octave network Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers with octave related bands as a flat line across the bands DaveP
