From Kuo Sheng Kasey Chang Subject Re How to the disks copy In article Guido Klemans writes In article Kuo Sheng Kasey Chang writes byteocide What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup REGISTERED TO XXXXX address city state zip and disables the Two benefits encourages registration cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus violated their license You take two copies with a different registration id compare them byte for byte and you know where they are Usually you will be able to find out what is what after Probably but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch NOT Sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes but WHY It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from And what keeps me form registering as John Doe from the company Public Domain Yellow Brick Road Tinseltown or something Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion I'm saying that you register via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you the patch which includes the info you put on the registration Kasey Chang
