From Eric Taylor Subject Re HELP WITH TRACKING DEVICE In article mcdonald writes There are a variety of water proof housings I could use but the real meat of the problem is the this What kind of transmission would be reliable underwater in murky or even night time conditions I'm not sure if sound is feasible given the distortion under direction would have to be accurate but range could be relatively short I imagine or hundred yards would be more than enough Jim McDonald Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS He details methods of underground and underwater wireless For a review refer to Electrical Experimenter March and June Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War and was unclassified after the Supposedly the government rethought this soon after and Rogers was convieniently The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated by the square of the distance but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at Furthermore the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise IF you find this hard to believe then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct while Hertzian wave theory was completely abberant ET Tesla was years ahead of his Perhaps now his time
