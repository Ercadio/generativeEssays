From John Schuch Subject Re Radio Electronics Free information card In article NEIL GANDLER writes How does the radio Electronics free information cards Do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their Some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer The advertiser decides what to do with the data they You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone My guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they For example if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week If you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole And then some companies like Digikey or Jameco have nothing to mail out accept the A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards Free industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their They use the information at least three They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to re They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that of readers requesting data were interested in And finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain For example Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's in the past The other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the If they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential Can you say qualified sales leads I thought you What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards Never circle more than number on the If you want more than items use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks If you are really really serious and you really really want the information CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK This will also cut about days off the the response Virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three Include a business name and phone number even if it's your Advertisers almost never John Schuch publisher of The Arizona High Tech Times The Arizona Electrical Journal The Arizona HVAC News all of which have bingo cards
