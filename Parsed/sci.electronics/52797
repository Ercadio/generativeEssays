from mike linnig subject re books info on audio dsp in article chris smith writes > i'm looking to build a dsp for guitar processing. hence lots of background

> > if anyone's got any info, could they email..... well, i'm not sure i'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter dsp construction article in the sept 92 issue of qst magazine (ham radio
oriented). the dsp is available in kit form for about $120. this particular dsp filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static). i built it and it really works well. the source code is
available too. it makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear. note that
this is for communication applications and is not "high fidelity". --
