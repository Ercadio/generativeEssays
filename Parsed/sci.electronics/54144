From Joel Kolstad Subject Re Blue LED's In article GLADMAN AVIV writes In order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy within the region of to electron According to my physical electronics prof you can't get an LED with that band That's why you don't find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of That is not to say that blue LEDs can't be I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic They didn't emit very much Your Professor if just plain Although blue LEDs are one heck of a lot less efficient than red Typical visible light LEDs don't really LEDs have a fairly narrow region of Since the Fermi energy around either side of the band gap falls off exponentially blah Source Solid State Electronic Devices Ben Streetman Prentice Hall You might want to check the copyright date on Blue LEDs most certainly do exist I've got a bunch at Cree Research makes them probably along with other Cree is big in materials science though they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today You can buy them from JameCo I think DigiKey definitely and plenty of other Actually these days you can get a typical visible light LED it's called a rainbow LED and I've forgotten who makes it they advertise in EDN and many of the other trade rags though It combines a reg green and blue LED all on one chip and has four leads Nifty device although it's probably fairly Joel Kolstad
