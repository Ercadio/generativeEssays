From mrc Paul Johnson Subject Re CAD Program for Electronics In article Fred Culpepper writes I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job of making schematic The program needs to be in MS DOS Windows if What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by dragging elements onto the screen and in this the elements needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs case with pins It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the components as well as their In other words I want to produce quality Printout would be to either pin dot matrix and or Laser I would suggest Draw for Windows by Micrografx I have this on my home Its quite impressive and only cost It has a rather nice clip art library facility which you can expand with your own There is no circuit component clip art included but you could add your own quite It works with any Windows printer driver of course and can also export embedded postscript and PCX Note I am not connected with Micrografx in any Paul Johnson Tel ext These ideas and others like them can be had GEC Marconi Research is not for each from any reputable responsible for my opinions
