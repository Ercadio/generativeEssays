From Zhahai Stewart Subject Re Police how does it work The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Not only is his word as a skilled observer good in court but his skill as an observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some cases No foolin He can guess a car's speed to within just by watching it blow by whether he's standing still or moving too Yes How was this testing done and how many times Calibrated speedometer It's not the some cases that worry me it's the other cases eg suboptimal viewing conditions even the best subjective viewer can only partial compensate for certain distortions and optical illusions
