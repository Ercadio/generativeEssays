from zhahai stewart subject re police radar just how does it work the father of a friend of mine is a police officer in west virginia. not >only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an >observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some >cases . . .. no foolin! he can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just >by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too! (yes, 1) how was this testing done, and how many times? (calibrated speedometer?) 2) it's not the "some cases" that worry me, it's the "other cases" :-) (eg: suboptimal viewing conditions; even the best subjective viewer can only
partial compensate for certain distortions and optical illusions).
