From Tom Gardner Subject Re Can Radio Be Used To Measure Distance In Robert Carpenter writes I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver It's called Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine This would be for short distances ft and I would need to have accuracy of inches or Depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this How about measuring vertical distance as well any chance or am I getting ridiculous What is the difference between vertical and horizontal What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter This depends on the required range the required accuracy the allowable ambiguity in range the frequencies the FCC etc allow you to
