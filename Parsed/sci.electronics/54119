From Ka Lun Pang Subject Self destructing copy protection on VHS tape Hi folks I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different However I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't want to take the chance even it's Anyone has experience in this kind of self destructing video tapes Thanks in Ka Lun Pang Andy Lost between frequency and time on the unit circle email DoD
