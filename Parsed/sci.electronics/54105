From David Vanderbyl Subject Re Pin out for C In article , Sean Kelly writes Does anyone know the pin outs for the C EPROM I have bought several of them, none of which has come with the pin outs Any info would be appreciated A good source of information for data of this type is the library In particular the library at a local college or technical school offering courses in electronics would have data books of this nature
