From Mark Fontana Subject Homemade projector automation Hi all I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in I'd like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights Our current automation consoles date from the early 's and don't provide this We already have the combo failsafe contact rollers to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade up control circuit VAC is momentarily closed for at least I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a relay activated when the cue tape completes the Low tech and simple but there's one problem In order to get the second pulse there needs to be a sh load of cuetape on the runs at feet per minute so to get a second pulse there needs to be at least inches of solid cuetape Ideally I would like to use a single cross cue to accomplish this A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film This would give a pulse of approximately of a What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be I figure this would require an RC circuit of some I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated Thanks Mark Fontana Of all the arts the cinema is Mark Fontana the most Computer and Information Science Lenin THE Ohio State University
