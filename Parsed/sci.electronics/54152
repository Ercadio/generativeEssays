From Tim Channon Subject Re Laser vs Bubblejet Here is a different FYI The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP deskjet is The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge however limit you to generating dots at per On almost any paper the ink wicks more than inch The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed with inkjet because smudges can It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput ppm for a laser versus about ppm for an ink jet A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long does the first sheet take to print Inkjets are faster than you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the I have a and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the printer A sage said to me Do you want one copy or lots of copies One Inkjet Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the A page yield toner cartridge is about US at discount while HP high capacity page yield cartridges are about US at It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet It is getting progressively closer between the two Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement Paper cost is the same and both can use Long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts consumables and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet There is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line This means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet Few drivers actually use this there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on E mail or
