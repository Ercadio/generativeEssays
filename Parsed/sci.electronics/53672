From Daniel J Rubin Subject Re what to do with old k SIMMs I was wondering if people had any good uses for old k SIMMs I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac and I know lots of other people do to I have tried to sell them but have gotten NO interest How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular Motorola microcontrollers I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am starting to get into them for some of my projects I have several k SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as free memory in one or two of my projects that would be great One project that comes to mind is a Caller ID device that would require quite a bit of RAM to store several hundered CID records etc Dan Daniel Joseph Rubin GO BENGALS GO BUCKS
