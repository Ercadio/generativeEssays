From Glenn A Sullivan Subject Re Long distance IR detection writes I designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level from a tone detector upon detecting a microwatt LED feet Used a Motorola biased linearly in a DC feedback loop to servo out variations in sunlight and from lights Used no Allen Sullivan I would be interested in knowing more about the sensing What did you use for the detector Could you detect the angle of location or did the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors field of view Phototransistor with Limiter feedback to base to control operating point I expect this really hurts Noise Figure Any comments from Phototransistor experts We intended to use this atop a stepper motor to provide headings to the The plan was to have or beacons of different frequencies in each room and tell the what frequency to phase lock We did not do One challenge was that the available stepper had degree steps Knowing the headings to each beacon we would have used the surveyor technique of RESECTION to determine robot No I ain't going to explain resection over the Given hindsight I would digitize the amplified output of the self nulling phototransistor circuit and correlate in phase quadrature square waves at the several expected frequencies to extract AMPLITUDE of each By doing this at the numerous steps even with degree steps with knowledge of the angular response of the phototransistor you SHOULD be able to rather more accurately determine the heading to each Allen Sullivan
