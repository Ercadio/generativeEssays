From Billy Quinn Subject Suggestions on Audio relays I built a little project using the radio shack relays to switch I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing I was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the My question is Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio I will appreciate any advice or references to Also exact part numbers company names for the relays will help Thanks Bill Quinn
