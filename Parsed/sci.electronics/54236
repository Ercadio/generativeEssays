From Mark A Battisti Subject Clear LCD or LED sheets I am interested in finding a supplier for an array of leds on material which is transparent when nothing is lit I'm not quite sure what LCD screens are like away from the laptop but I would guess they are not too clear An ideal item would be an LED array for which each LED is about square Yes very course This is for distance viewing, but on a window Any pointers of suggestions would be much appreciated Mark Battisti Summit Street B Columbus, Ohio
