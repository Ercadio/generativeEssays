From Jack Brindle Subject Re Can Radio Be Used To Measure Distance In article Tom Gardner writes In Robert Carpenter writes I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver It's called Well actually not Both Radar and Radio Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its reflection from a Radar generally uses pulses while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave In the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be As an example the original Bendix ALA Radio Altimeter was accurate to foot at feet Note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter This cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually travel faster in free space air in this case than wire the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable So you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance Something like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick triggering both the transmitter and receiver Sound expensive Not too bad but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and Why not go to a different method Surveyors use a laser light system where again the reflection time is Why not try this Sounds like something a should know about anyway Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine This would be for short distances ft and I would need to have accuracy of inches or This is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over You would need to continuously calibrate the entire With the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at one place it is much easier to Note especially that the time base for the receiver and transmitter is one unit Depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this FM capture effect says that the strongest signal That is unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than db in signal This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter As high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies around Hope this Jack Brindle ham radio internet
