From John Haddy Subject Re Help with ultra long timing In article writes I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to What I am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state What they want to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six Every two weeks they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the Then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold degrees and a power source that wouldn't I have looked at the XR timers and the standard dual timers but thier temp specs won't go that Also two weeks equates to seconds per firing which means one big timing cap I have found farad yes Farad caps that have a working voltage of volts and are small in But again the time of discharge at or lower degrees isn't I was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the One possibility would be to use solar panels but this is during the six month Anyone have any good ideas Thanks in Wes Firstly I would never consider trying to make a one shot Your cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant Their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or vice versa once every If you were to use something like a clock you would need a divider chain of to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week Of course you could trim the oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at is low I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer Caveat I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics so I can't guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney AUSTRALIA Email Ph Fax
