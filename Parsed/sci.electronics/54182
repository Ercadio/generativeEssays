From Henry Spencer Subject Re WD as moisture repellant was Lead Acid batteries Concrete In article myers Bob Myers writes It isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature Uh Bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature On the time scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground there isn't going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it's sitting Question why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it Because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object your hand which is kept much warmer than its In the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if it started out not in equilibrium with them but won't affect the final For the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will resembles a high speed collision Henry Spencer U of Toronto Zoology between and Dick Dunn utzoo henry
