from gary segal subject pinout needed for til i've recently picked up some til display chips, but i can't find any information on them. it seems they are no longer made by ti, and
i don't have an old enough data book. :-( it appears to have a dot-matrix led display capable of showing one hex
digit. it is in a 14 pin dip package, but pins 6, 9, and 11 are not
present. if you have any information on this part (pinout, power requirments,
functions, ...) please send me e-mail. thank you, -- gary segal motorola inc. cellular infrastructure division --- we are standing here only to gaze at the wind ---
