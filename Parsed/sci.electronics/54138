From Aaron Lung Subject Looking for Toshiba TA specs I'm looking for some specs for a Toshiba TA BP It appears to be a power amp housed in a pin inline package and is used in my Mitsubishi VCR, circa , as a DC motor controller for the tape drive Checking in the oldest IC Master I have , I don't see it listed, and it appears to have been discontinued If anyone has anything on this part, I'd be greatly indebted thanks in advance, aaron
