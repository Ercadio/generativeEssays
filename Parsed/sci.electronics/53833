From Stan Burton Subject Long distance IR detection I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an IR emitting source at a distance of about meters more is better in The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward KHz square wave with duty I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic to give information to a pan tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED s possibly an Optek or Motorola Wazing would mean at least Amp current At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the Has anyone done something like this Stan Burton DND CRAD DRES DTD MSS AGCG DRE Suffield Box Medicine Hat AB Canada
