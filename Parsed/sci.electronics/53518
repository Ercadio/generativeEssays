From Joel Kolstad Subject Re Dumb Question Function Generator In article David Glen Jacobowitz writes I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built now where was that ad for the combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren I saw function generator has a offset and the amplitude's too high Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little The box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or I could just build a little buffer amp but I'd like to have this box not be Sure you've already got the right Ignoring the ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider made of ohms in series with This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly less than You may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or the availability of Hows that sound Joel Kolstad This is why those high voltage probes for multimeters can be accurate but still They have something like megs in series with which doesn't load the often high impedence source much as well as keeping the probably meg impedance multimeter
