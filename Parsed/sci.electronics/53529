From Aaron Lung Subject Re what to do with old SIMMs In article Stewart Beal writes In article Jason Haines writes I was wondering if people had any good uses for old I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac and I know lots of other people do I have tried to sell them but have gotten NO So if you have an inovative use or want to buy some SIMMs I would be very interested in hearing about One of the guys at work takes of them uses cyano acrylate glue to make five four wide panels then constructs a box with bottom to use as a pencil Or if you've got some entreprenuerial sp spirit get a cheapy clear plastic box mount the simm inside and sell it as a 'Pet SIMM' I'm sure there are plenty of suckers out there who would go for it aaron
