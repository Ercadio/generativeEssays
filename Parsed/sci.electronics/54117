From Robert Wiegand Subject Re Lead Acid batteries Concrete Carter Ames writes I was just wondering one thing actually I hope that this is the proper place to post this subject Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminals are I asked a friend and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them but he couldn't tell me I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the However you would have been better off leaving them Keeping them cold would have been better for them than bringing them A warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it I suspect this is what caused your problems Robert Wiegand Motorola Disclamer I didn't do it I was somewhere else at the
