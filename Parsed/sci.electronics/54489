From marxhausen paul Subject Re Passive Mixer Wendy Shaffer writes I'm trying to build a mixer for a friend of mine to run several things into a single boom I have a circuit that uses an op amp powered by either a couple of batteries or using some kind of power But in a catalog I was looking at recently a passive mixer for guitar was advertised taht doesn't appear to use any power at Does anyone know what the circuit for this would be because then I could just adapt it for RCA jacks and save my friend and I alot of messing with batteries and Well the fastest crudest mixer aside from just physically connecting all your inputs together directly is to run each signal through a resistor to a common The resistors give some isolation so the signal sources aren't driving directly into each Taking a wild seat of the pants guess I'd say that if you are mixing high impedance sources like some dynamic mikes electric guitar pickups your resistors ought to be maybe or If you are mixing line level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman or such I'd go with input output input input paul marxhausen university of nebraska lincoln grace happens
