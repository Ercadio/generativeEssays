From Aaron Lung Subject Re Motorola and In article Henry Spencer writes In article Stefan Berg writes I don't know why my FPU has an XC my original FPU was label but it seems to work fine on my Or does it mean eXperimental Chip instead of Motorola Chip The rule for the designations is that if it says MC that means it works exactly the way the datasheet book If it says XC that means there is at least one known Often these bugs are small and obscure you might never run into them in XC units are often pre production sample Those are normally distributed for evaluation as freebies and are not guaranteed to meet every At least Motorola admits it unlike certain other Yep that's for 's one thing I like most about aaron
