From Subject TV RECEPTION HEELLLPPP Hello I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at least pick up the networks and I do not have tons of money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution for reception for under I have seen modules that you plug into your wall outlet that supposedly make your entire house an I have to admit even with my limited knowledge of wavelength and aerial reception this seems dubious in its claims for excellent reception at I'll try anything though if it I am in a non mountainous area approximately miles from the transmitting stations which are pretty large Montgomery Alabama and Colombus Goergia Any recommendations of products brand names prices and company info catalog ordering numbers addresses Thank you in Paul Sylvester Shanley VOICE
