From baden de bari Subject Re PC parallel I I O Alan Erickson writes I'm trying to bring in bits to a PC, and would like to use interrupt driven routines Without buying an IO board or making a new port, where can I bring in these bits LPT seems to have only a few inputs, but I've heard rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines Anybody know fer sure If any bi d LPTs, which boards have them I'll be running a new DX Yes, it is possible I'm making a stepper controller board, with digital inputs, and up to digital outputs from the port One main thing that will tell you whether the port is bi directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it Look for a chip numbered LS If you don't have this, then it's probably a LS , which will do you NO good for reading in Now, if you do have the ' then do the following First, find the address of the port, decimal either , or In pascal, you would Write Port xxx where xxx is the address in either hex or decimal The status lines, pins , , , as well as the strobe, pin , are bi directional lines, and are read by base address , so for , to read from status, then read from You can also output to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines In pascal, do Port xxx value Hope this helps Let me know if you need more help Inspiration comes to o those who seek the Baden de Bari unknown
