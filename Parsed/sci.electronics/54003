From David Plumpe Subject Re Making up odd resistor values required by filters In Ian Hawkins writes When constructing active filters odd values of resistor are often required something like a K Ohm resistor It seems best to choose common capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard values per decade etc It is a common enough problem yet I cant recall seing a program that tells that Rx Ry Rz gives Rq starting with q and finding prefered values x y and Since you're worrying about the third decimal place I assume you're using tolerance resistors and capacitors
