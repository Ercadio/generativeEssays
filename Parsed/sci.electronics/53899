From Mr M J Brown Subject Floopy drives UPDATE Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have which is I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B Not only do you have to change the speed from to rpm tried that but also change components in the Rec Play section to allow for the lower data rate not as it was designed for and also change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate rev speed Hopefully this should sort it all out not bad for quid normally quid and upwards The drive is a JVC MDP series drive Michael Brown Lost interest It's so bad I've lost apathy
