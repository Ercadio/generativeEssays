From Michael Golan Subject how can uF be different from two in series I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony receivers and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor s that hangs off the output to the speakers to speaker identical both models from amp idnetical both models Canadian model only US model and world wide model Candian model only gound The board itself is also identical with room for all three The US Can versions is clearly indicated in both How does that make sense is essentially for caps there are just standard caps no special W type precision Please explain this Michael Golan
