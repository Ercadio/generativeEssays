From Kuo Sheng Kasey Chang Subject Re How to the disks copy In article Steve Madsen writes backupable if restored to the same machine depends on the don't use a disk drive characteristic If the user did an upgrade to the machine he she should reinstall all programs any No document look up no disk wear and tear This is not a good I upgraded my motherboard last I would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because I changed Opinion is I assume you have a tape drive Not all of us have about floppies around for backup you Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a Are you going to require that a user re install all their software if they add of RAM to their computer I did that a couple of weeks It's in the BIOS and if software had told me this isn't the machine you installed me on I would never have used that software Really bad RAM is something you add all the time so It's more like BIOS manufacturer and or processor type etc Data cannot be used esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a On the other hand to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as Please Insert Original Disk XX as I need file YYYYYY for update It would be perfectly Sort I did not say that the originals would allow only one The user's conscience should do This is It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then give them Your scheme isn't going to stop Of course it is Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow only one install What is your point You know how many bytes you need to change in X wing to disable the quiz TWO Yes TWO And don't ask me which ones they Do you know any assembly language at all All anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a JMP instruction to just completely skip Not that difficult really And there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of Using PKLITE or some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed were tagged as I know and assembly quite well thank I know exactly which two bytes need to be changed I have the code to do them I just said Don't ask me which I didn't say I don't know what that Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti patching code which does a self check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match value stored encrypted of course in the It could be claimed as a part of anti virus code and it would not be far from the What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup REGISTERED TO XXXXX address city state zip and disables the This is by far the best idea you presented in your Making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual But the determined ones are just going to answer Joe Blow to the question of what's your name so this won't stop them in the long Did ANYONE read what I wrote That is NOT what I wrote or meant What I said was the program should have certain restriction such as the restrict to one machine UNTIL the program is registered with the The manufacturer will then supply the then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the Registered to XXX Pirates are always going to win this They simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection Of course they will but that was NOT my The purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates Oh can I have a copy of that Sure and the less sophisticated pirates Let's look for all those calls to Any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will They can always backtrace the entire load sequence of the The point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses or to minimize such intrusion of legitimate Pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them and no amount of copy protection will stop them but the rest of us WILL be How many of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us Not that Kasey Chang
