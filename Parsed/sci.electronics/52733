From Scott Dorsey Subject Re Log stereo high quality pot hi fi In article A C M Hicks writes Cobus Theunissen writes Hi there, I am looking for a high quality log stereo k pot for an audio preamplifier The design specifies Alps RKGA k AX , but I cannot find it anywhere Any suggestions The best pots around IMHO are made by Penny Giles in the UK Their basic model has a solid brass case, and conductive plastic elements matched to dB across the whole rotation The downside is that they cost upwards of quid each The P G pots are very good The Alps ones are usually carried by the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine I'll also recommend the Noble potentiometers, if you don't mind weird metric sizes on everything scott
