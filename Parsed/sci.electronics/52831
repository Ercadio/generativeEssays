From Subject Home made IR remote extender Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for it is a little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output Then I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared The circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car All remote commands are relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove It works fine with my Denon CD player but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's VCR it didn't The circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a Sony CCD camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD Any advice would be Brian UBSILER
