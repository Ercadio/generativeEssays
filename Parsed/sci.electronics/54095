From Tony stewart Subject Re Making up odd resistor values required by filters Ian Hawkins writes When constructing active filters odd values of resistor are often required something like a K Ohm resistor It seems best to choose common capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard values per decade etc It is a common enough problem yet I cant recall seing a program that tells that Rx Ry Rz gives Rq starting with q and finding prefered values x y and Cheers Ian H WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than you need a trimmer or to screen devices it can't be made from adding resitors of value in parallel since the smaller device will have the error of to cope You have choices a live with the error of tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low sensitivity designs b buy resistors with better than tolerance Vishay Dale c use trimmers or SOT's Select On Test The Inquiring Mind BBS Winnipeg Manitoba
