From DP Richard D Pierce Subject Re Pink Noise In article T tW N JUTS ccc amdahl com David Sharpe writes Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies This is in most cases around the K Hz range Pink White are used to adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that There are a few EQ's out on the market that have Pink noise built in Most all from Audio Control have them I know the C does Wrong, wrong, completely wrong and a little misleading, too White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant bandwidth That is, a Hz wide band at Hz will have precisely the same amount of energy as a Hz band at kHz Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant precentage bandwidth Thus, a wide band of noise at Hz whose bandwidth is Hz will contain the same energy as a wide band at kHz whose bandwidth is Hz wide White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio type real time analyzers whose bandwidths are centert frequency dependent often described as octave or octave or some such terminology White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies at a rate equal to dB per octave Pink noise, relative to white noise, has more energy at low frequencies at a rate equl to, again, db octave Dick Pierce Loudspeaker and Software Consulting Sartelle Street Pepperell, MA Voice and FAX
