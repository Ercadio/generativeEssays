From James MacPhail Subject Help Need thermal specs for MC FE I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU I have the Motorola MC UM AD Rev , but I fear it is out of date as it does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi What I need is the Theta JC Thermal Characteristic the Junction to Case thermal resistance for the PLASTIC FE style package If you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings suffer a few days delay here If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value for the typical power dissipation I'm assuming Watts using the W maximum at C decreased the way the Pd drops in the x as Ta increases If your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what it reads at C and C Thanks for reading James MacPhail on bounce try
