From Scott Dorsey Subject Re Using generated power on large sound systems In article Pete Ashdown writes I've bothered the rental shops and audio shops about the problem but most of them have precious little experience in dealing with generated My suspicion is that I don't really need anything larger than and this could all be resolved with a transformer of some Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough I would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short You can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try strapping the amps for service and running mains cables out which will minimize the line If these don't work though you're going to need a bigger I assume that you're using well maintained generators and have watched the voltage output on the generator If you don't have coming out of the unloaded generator you'll never get at the other Can anyone offer any advice I want to do a lot of outdoor events this summer and it would be nice if this power problem could be resolved I've been looking into buying a power pack so I could tap into junction boxes directly but have no idea where to One that would resolve my generator problems as well would be of high value to I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of work and not with the pro audio Also I recommend that you don't try to tap into junction boxes at all but hire a licensed electrician if you don't really know what you are I've had to clean up after two people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot boxes and it wasn't much scott
