From Subject Re Radar detector DETECTORS In A Randy Agee writes So, the questions are What do the radar detector detectors actually detect Would additional shielding grounding bypassing shield stray RF generated by a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector antenna Are any brands quieter than others Ok, so your a HAM Well, tune in Mhz or Khz These numbers sound like some you have herd before Thats right, you guessed it, they are common IF numbers Every Super Het receiver has a local oscillator s which generates an IF This is what your detector detector is detecting the local oscillator Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to receiver you If you want to receiver something at say Ghz you must generate a local oscillator signal of Ghz Mhz your local osc frequency This Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage your mileage may vary Since the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a I think you get the picture
