From Griff Miller X Subject Re In article A Ronald Willey CS writes The Supra accelerator that is mentioned in one of the pervious articles, is not or based It runs on a at Mhz and the design they are using is very simple if you were referring to the A exteranal model Hmm I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing I was the original poster, BTW The accelerator that I'm talking about almost certainly uses a HC , according to the footnotes in the Supra ad It only costs list, so I really doubt if it has a MHz inside It's called the Supra , or Supra Turbo There's an external A model, and an internal A model BTW, does anyone know if a Mhz HC exists Griff Miller Griff M use this for email My opinions are mine, not Western's Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good Anyone who does what is good is from God Anyone who does evil has not seen God John
