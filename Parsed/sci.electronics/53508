From David Glen Jacobowitz Subject Dumb Question Function Generator I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function For one there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull offset' is pushed That is I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random The other really annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about p I am a student you may have guessed from my previous posts and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than amplitude and most have input impedances in the 's of Kohm The thing is in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing Then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in With the output of the generator I could just ignore it but now with this little divider there I have to figure that It's kind of a pain in the Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little The box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or I could just build a little buffer amp but I'd like to have this box not be Any quick The scope's not For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced The function generator was the same way on that one please help as I am feeling very stupid today dave
