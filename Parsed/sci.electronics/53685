From Mustafa Kocaturk Subject How starters work really In article Peter Tryndoch writes So when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in the main When the tube fires insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi metalic strip straightens out O C This description ignores the role of the ballast misrepresents the heating effects in the The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit because the neon discharge stops and much less heat is generated from the I loss in the metal as compared to the neon The starter contacts open before the tube Actually the tube fires as a result of the back emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube Mustafa Kocaturk EE Room Caruth Home Office SMU Box Dallas TX
