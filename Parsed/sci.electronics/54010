From George Gruschow Subject Re How to the disks copy Babak Sehari writes In Matt Block writes In article Babak Sehari writes I was wondering what copy protection techniques are avaliable and how effective are they Has anyone have any experience in this area With highest regards Babak Uh Umm there are a number of copy protection Some involve modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a I recall however near monthly releases of new ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest The fact is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near Some are more or less difficult to crack and some have already been I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult if not impossible to What exactly do you want to know Do you need a good one for a project you are working on How secure must it be Are you trying to crack one that someone else has used I can probably make suggestions assuming the activity is strictly In general it is a BAD idea legally to tamper with copy It can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy protected which can be Do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications and are merely curious Please clear up those questions and I'll try to help as much as I Incidentally the Uh at the top is indicative of the dread anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels when they are asked how to The area you are broaching is wrought with dangers many of which include breaking the law or at least addressing it from one side or the Matt I have written a program and I want to market I would like certain degree of protection since my main custmers are individuals and not the I know laser hole burning method and hardware key method however my software is going to cost only so I can not afford Also at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my Well I guess say upto illigal copying is ok by However I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my Off course I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying since they can develope a better program With highest regards Babak One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask you for a word from page x line y and word z but this is pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program and some self rewriting code to confuse some Also make sure that your program can not be run out a Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk just write a certain key to a certain unallocated To help you here you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well or they wanna be crackers can just look for the junk in some random Like you mentioned there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user which you is the opposite of what you Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think If the program does not find that this is the same system it requests being installed by the original disk The original disk should be encrypted compacted have many sectors that should be checked and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be Once again you MUST put code encryption self rewriting code and multiple CRC checks in the program to make sure that it does not get Among other things this also protects your program from If the program detects a change in its code tell the user that a virus has been detected in the Tell them the program is VIRUS SECURE and remember you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some Feel I hope that I have Have Knock some cracking out well you can't do it everything that can be written can be cracked but you'll piss'em off in the process What is the program that will be sold George Gruschow Death do you
