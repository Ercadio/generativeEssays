From Scott Townsend Subject Electric power line balls I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate some His question is about some diameter balls which are attached to electric power lines in his He's seen up to a half dozen between two Neither of us have any experience with electric power My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles Anyone know what they really are Is there a related FAQ for this Is there a better group to submit to We'd both appreciate some Scott Townsend Sverdrup Technology NASA Lewis Research Center Group
