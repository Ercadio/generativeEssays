From Mark Robert Thorson Subject Re Building a UV flashlight The simplest and cheapest soft UV bulb is an AR argon bulb or other argon bulb It works like a neon bulb except it glows purple It will cause stuff to fluoresce It requires very little power, just a battery, an oscillator, and a step up transformer to about volts Electronic Goldmine has several UV lamps, both as pre built units and kits Ask for their catalog
