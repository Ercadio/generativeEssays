From Dave Medin Subject Re What is Zero dB In article Babak Sehari writes In Mark Underwood writes I am somewhat familiar with the dB measurements as they apply to electrical circuits it is the gain of for example an amplifier measured on a logarithmic However this requires that you have a reference value the ouput is with respect to the input stuff deleted What you actually talking about here is dBm and not However the terms are used loosely by most dBm'' is power with respact to whereas dB is a Now like these two English statement I am doing I am doing Similarly people usually use dB for Another common mistake is spelling db'' instead of dB'' as you did in your See the B'' is for Bell'' company the mother of AT T and should be With highest regards Babak Good gravy Decibels are all The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit Sometimes this will be a reference power such as milliwatt given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known like ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance leading to an accepted notation of Maybe it might be dBV disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed using volt as reference amplitude rather than reference power Or it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation leading to just plain look at it this way 'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit For power dB log P measured P reference For amplitude dB log A measured A reference 'B' is for bel which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base named after Alexander Graham A 'deci' Bel is of a It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's The small 'd' large 'B' is per SI notation I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it Common references for audio are dBm milliwatt across ohms dBV volt VU a zero on the VU meter dBm pro gear line level VU consumer gear line level Often times a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the dB It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or Note that in a circuit with a given and maybe unknown linear impedance if the amplitude goes up so many decibels the power will also increase the same This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's Dave Medin Phone w SSD Networking h Intergraph M S Internet Huntsville AL UUCP ingr catbyte dtmedin Everywhere You Look at least around my office The opinions expressed here are mine or those of my machine
