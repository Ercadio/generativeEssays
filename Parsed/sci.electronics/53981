From Thomas Schaerer Subject Re Voltage regulation and current limiting Andy Collins wrote One not so quick question to throw out there for you For our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs Voltatge adjustable from Current limited at Voltage must stay within of designated value for I from AC ripple less than mV rms To decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of the limiter current and the allowed temp In the first case you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltage reference of about VDC with a temp drift of In the second case its better you use a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum The output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the Bye Thomas
