From Thomas Schaerer Subject Re Voltage regulation and current limiting Andy Collins wrote One not so quick question to throw out there for you guys For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs Voltatge adjustable from V Current limited at A Voltage must stay within of designated value for I from A AC ripple less than mV rms To decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of the limiter current and the allowed temp drift In the first case, you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltage reference of about VDC with a temp drift of mV K In the second case its better you use a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current The output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current Bye Thomas
