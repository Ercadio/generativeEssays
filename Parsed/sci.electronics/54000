from j jonas subject re electronic parts in nyc in article ed ravin writes trans-am electronics, canal street near 7th ave -- lots of surplus type
>stuff. they've been out of busines for years. >several other electronics or "surplus" type places are still on canal
>street. not any more. about 2 years ago they all closed.
when ramco/electronics city closed, it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out (so i heard).
there are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires,
but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff. sylvan/wellington is still on broadway and canal, but they're
not cheap, and not surplus. it's mostly a tv repairman's store. -- jeffrey jonas -- jeffrey jonas
