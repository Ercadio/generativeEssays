From Subject level brightness Xmas light set for Easter Yes I know it's nowhere near Christmas time but I'm gonna loose Net access in a few days maybe a week or if I'm lucky and wanted to post this for interested people to save 'till Note Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss I have Subject Xmas light set with levels of brightness Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set This set starts with a blinker bulb DIAGRAM orginal way set b b modified set for level brightness string string b rtn Note no mods to wiring to the right of this Only one blinker is Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string bulbs because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with That's why the use of the resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not When the blinker goes open this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings slightly dimmer slightly Or use a bulb in place of the resistor if you can get Caution do not replace with a standard bulb as these draw too much current and burn out the approx What you'll see when it's working powerup string will light at full brightness and b will be lit bypassing most of the current from the second string making them not b will open placing both strings in series making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced Be sure to wire and insulate the splices resistor leads and cut wires in a safe manner
