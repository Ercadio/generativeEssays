From galen Galen Watts Subject Re Suggestions on Audio relays In article TOM WAGNER Wizzard of old Audio Visual Campus writes In article Aaron Lung writes In article Billy Quinn writes I built a little project using the radio shack relays to switch I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing I was doing My question is Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive optical isolator It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp all packaged in a When the lamp is off the cell is high Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers I use an FET optoisolater to switch microphone level There is no click since I put a cap across the Distortion measurement are very low with mic level and they went up to at a dB line All I did was put the FET in series with one leg of the balanced No hums pops just audio jumping out of The FET runs about million ohms with the LED dark and drops to ohms with it Hey it works and works Galen Watts
