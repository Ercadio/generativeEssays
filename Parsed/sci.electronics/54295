From John Kamchen Subject VGA circuit I've come across a circuit from Integrated Circuit Systems Inc called a GSP This chip genlocks a VGA card to a dual input NTSC signal The output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various speeds I notice that it outputs a mhz clock can this output be used on an Amiga system And must it be NTSC VGA or can it be NTSC NTSC Any simple circuits to boost an NTSC to a VGA signal Need to genlock a laser disc to my khz video John The Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba
