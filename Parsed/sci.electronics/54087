From lenahan grant f Subject Re Adcom cheap products Much deleted about assembly in USA other I wish to focus on the subject of warm running amplifiers Sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna The amp you have probably is running Class A the whole because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs There is a correclation between warm running amps and good sound or in your words it DOES have a bearing Now I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove amplifiers that will degrade lifespan but a cold running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warm running And since junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental effect on a few facts bias points vary with temperature junction resist varrie with temp Adcom products do NOT run class A If you still don't beleive this assertion consider the warm up requirements for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier warm On many designs its quite audible on mine about minutes for the output stage many hours for the Fortunately the drivers are not In any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias idle current Both have a positive correlation with low distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in warmer operation all other factors being Grant
