From David Vanderbyl Subject Re Question on addressing In article , Sean Kelly writes I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip, particulary a C EPROM Although I don't know that much about it, as I understand it, there's a pin on the chip that, when voltage is applied, kicks up the address The question is how do you determine how many bytes the address is incremented by For example, if I have code I want to be accessed at and also at say how do I move the address pointer to those positions Thanks for any info Sean Kelly Sysop Amizon BBS Always looking for classic video games for the following systems Atari Atari ColecoVision Atari Intellivision Vectrex Judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at 'csus edu' Since you've chosen the C you are probably trying to make a 'multicart' To do this simply Load the game images into the EEPROM at , , etc Your EEPROM burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address' is simply another address line For a concrete example, with the C and K games images, you would wire A A to the cartridge, and A A to switches The switches would allow you to pick from the games on the EEPROM
