From Joel Kolstad Subject Re Can Radio Freq Be Used To Measure Distance In article C v M C Robert G Carpenter writes I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver Yes, you could Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance This would be for short distances ft , and I would need to have accuracy of inches, or so Well, letsee whipping out HP SX, soon to be GX inches m s nanoseconds resolution Hmm That'll be rather difficult The more standard read better method is to use ultrasound, generally somewhere around kHz Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light radio waves , and is therefore much easier to deal with What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous sonic estimator type devices that do what you want here Many are pretty cheap too In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling for something like That's the one I bought Joel Kolstad
