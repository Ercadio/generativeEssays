From Joel Kolstad Subject Re Can Radio Be Used To Measure Distance In article Robert Carpenter writes I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver Yes you Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine This would be for short distances ft and I would need to have accuracy of inches or Well letsee whipping out HP soon to be GX inches m s nanoseconds That'll be rather difficult The more standard read better method is to use ultrasound generally somewhere around Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light radio waves and is therefore much easier to deal What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous sonic estimator type devices that do what you want Many are pretty cheap too In fact for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling for something like That's the one I bought Joel Kolstad
