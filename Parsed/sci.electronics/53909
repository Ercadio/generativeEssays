From John Whitmore Subject Re Suggestions on Audio relays In article Billy Quinn writes I built a little project using the radio shack relays to switch I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio With relays alone you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any If you don't want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistor output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing to gently MUTE the signal then switch THEN remove the power from the lamp in the It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which drives the lamp from contaminating the And the devices are cheaper than John Whitmore
