from david hembrow subject re sid chip to ibm system bus mr mc howell wrote please don't ask questions like "why don't you buy a soundblaster". the
: answer is simple "overpriced considering the sound quality". why not try one of the projects to build a dac connected to the parallel
port as documented in some files which come with modplay ? these vary from
a 4 dac design to a simple single dac made only of resistors.-- david hembrow eo europe ltd.,
