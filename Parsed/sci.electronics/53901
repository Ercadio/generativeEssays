From Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article A , Stan Burton writes I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an IR emitting source at a distance of about meters more is better in daylight The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward KHz square wave with duty cycle I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give information to a pan tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED s , possibly an Optek OP or Motorola MLED Wazing would mean at least Amp current pulses At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the required Has anyone done something like this Why don't you just run one LED at KHz and use a flip flop at the receiving end to divide by and give you a good square KHz signal Just a thought LORI Stan Burton DND CRAD DRES DTD MSS AGCG DRE Suffield, Box , Medicine Hat, AB, Canada, T A K RED FISHY WINS Lori Gardi ext Dept of Astronomy, University of Western Ontario London, ON, CANADA, N A K
