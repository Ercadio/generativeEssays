From Seema Varma Subject Luser Hi, I am looking for a very high speed D A converter at least bits and MHz for a research application A paper in the January issue of IEEE Solid State Circuits mentions a GaAs, GHz, bit DAC anyone know where I can find such a thing Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would do Needless to say, I have looked in all the conventional places Vitesse, Motorola, National, etc etc Any pointers would be appreciated Seema Varma
