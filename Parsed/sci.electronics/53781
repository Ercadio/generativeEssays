From Andrew Payne Subject WANTED chips small quantities Does anyone know if a source for the modem chips as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems Ideally something that is geared toward hobbyists small quantity mail order For years we've been buying them from a distributor Marshall by the hundreds for PMP But orders have dropped to the point where we can no longer afford to offer this And all of the distributors I've checked have some crazy minimum order or so I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP Any suggestions Andrew Payne DEC Cambridge Research Lab
