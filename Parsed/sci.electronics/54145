From Glenn A Sullivan Subject Re Long distance IR detection Stan Burton writes I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an IR emitting source at a distance of about meters more is better in daylight The IR source could be emitting a signature I'm leaning toward KHz square wave with duty cycle I designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level from a tone detector upon detecting a microwatt LED feet away Used a Motorola MRD , biased linearly in a DC feedback loop to servo out variations in sunlight and Hz from lights Used no lenses Allen Sullivan
