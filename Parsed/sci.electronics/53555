From Aaron Lung Subject Re Telephone on hook off hok ok circuit In article John Thomson writes Just a thought of mine here Since an on hook line is aprox and off hook it usually drops below How about an LED in series with a zener say around On hook LED on Off hook LED Would this work If anyone tries tried it please let me Aye there's the rub if you draw enough current to light an LED the equipment at the phone company will think you've gone off In the on hook state you're not supposed to draw Which means you should just use your Digital You can use an old VOM but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think there's something wrong with the Look Guys what's the problem here If you want a light that goes on when the 'phone is Off hook all you need it to run it in series with the line as I mentioned in my previous If you want a light that goes on when the 'phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold If you're going to do the series Diode thing which is the easiest just make sure that the LED can take the current I can't recall it off hand but it's something like or more Careful now Also consider the that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring Even with a simple zener and LED setup you might end up with some carbon real Whatever scheme you use make sure you've got at least rated components on the Also remember that if I'm not mistaken the phone line is a equivalent Any current you draw from the or so gets dropped across that That's fine until you're down to roughly when Ma Bell considers it to be off But dropping it that far down is probably a big no The easiest implementation to accomplish the above tip rectifier resistor diode V zener resistor V LED ring This is only a ahead and blow holes in it but you get the Choose a high efficiency LED so you don't need much current to get it to light Choose values for the other components as aaron
