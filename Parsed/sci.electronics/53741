From Baker John PDD Subject How does Differential Mode GPS work I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option known as differential ready Apparently land based beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS receiver with differential option installed How does this system work What frequency is used for the land based beacons Thanks in advance Charlie Thompson Here's a rough sketch of how the system A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion SA Selective Availability time dithering The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local If the receivers are nearby and are using the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver Thus the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference The US Coast Guard is currently as far as I know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential These stations will use existing radio I believe the frequency is to be approximately There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different For example PinPoint offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM Advertised accuracies espouse to meter John Baker My opinions are my I don't know Johns Hopkins University anyone else who wants them Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD
