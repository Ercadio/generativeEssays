From Joseph Chiu Subject Re Phosphorescent pads baden de bari writes A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about x or so that could be plugged into something and they would glow One was red, another green, another blue Interresting I was wondering if anyone would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price oh, the pads were rubber like and were floppy like, about cm thick or so The curiosities that you speak of are EL Electro Luminescent pads They are mostly used as backlights for LCD's, and as you pointed out, comes in several different colors Many of them emit white ish colors true white, and blue whiteis blue are the ones that I've personally encountered the most often They vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at about Vrms, and at much higher than Hz Hz to kHz, if I recall correctly You can get them to work at Vrms, Hz i e , line but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster Oh yes, almost forgot, EL's have this tendency to wear out over time Joseph Chiu OS You gotta get this thing MSC Caltech Pasadena, CA Dear IBM Hire bunch of technically incompetent people like my brother to test OS installation procedures
