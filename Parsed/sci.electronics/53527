From Harry Langenbacher Subject Re Uninterruptible Power Supply In article NURDEN NURDEN Dale Nurden writes I'm wanting to build a simple UPS for my PC sustain the computer long enough to complete the current task and save, to minutes should be enough I think, though I don't really need to keep the monitor active I can try to remember what to do so maybe I can avoid a DC AC inverter and just use a battery to directly supply the motherboard and peripherals Now there's a good idea All you need is amps DC for a few minutes, and a good wetware memory was I using wp or autocad or I thought of the same idea myself a few days ago I've got a fairly new car battery that I take along in my x when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy duty volt regulator to supply the PC But I guess you'd need v and v and too more batteries An alternative would be to leave a AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery and run a vdc to vac converter running all the time, and when the power goes out, voi la the vac converter keeps on running off the battery and then I could take the vac converter and my computer on the camping trips Harry Langenbacher harry FAX , Concurrent Processing Devices Group, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, M S , Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena CA USA
