From Keith Ledig Subject needed v watt fan Can someone tell me where to find volt watt mA fans that fit the standard computer mounting size ie and inch wide and inches diagonal from hole to hole hole where bolt or screw goes through I have found higher NOISY fans that are v watt, but I need a quite fan I can use volt as well, but found just about all volt fans to be noisy I also find that the v fans are not only quieter, but the blade shape has a lot to do with it I have a dead fan that was quiet in it's day It has long blades like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is the only way I can describe it The dead fan is ETRI Model LH Actually it's not dead, it just makes a hideous rattle noise so it's stealthy qualities are void Thanks
