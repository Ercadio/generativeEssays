From Eric Taylor Subject Re Electronic Tesla Coils In article David Prutchi writes In article Jerry Long writes Fred Culpepper wrote A couple of years ago I put together a Tesla circuit which was published in an electronics magazine and could have been the circuit which is referred to This one used a flyback transformer from a tv onto which you wound your own primary It also used power transistors in a TO years ago I built a ' volt Tesla and the thing was VERY spectacular but besides scaring amazing friends depending on their knowledge of Science and generating strong EMI I never found anything useful that could be done with it Is there any real world application for Tesla coils today David Prutchi First of all realize that Tesla invented AC power generators motors transformers conductors Technically ALL transformers are Tesla In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil they mean an air core resonant transformer The TV flyback version Tesla coil see the Encyclopedia of Electronic Circuits for diagram has NOT an air It is of a class of circuit called Oscillating Shuttle Circuit OSC Generally OSC's are highly efficient but this version uses transistors and resistors which are very lossy Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors so that he could achieve efficiencies of and The usual application of an air core resonant transformer or of an OSC is to produce strong EMI for wireless How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla flyback coil from it If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils our lights would go dark our cars would sputter and die our radios would go silent our industries would grind to a halt and we would have to go back to using coal for heat gas for lamps horses for transportation steam for power and telegraph for Is that real world enough for you GET THE MESSAGE WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE If it had been up to Edison we'd still be in the flame me at your own I'm very good at putting edison down ET Tesla was years ahead of his Perhaps now his time comes
