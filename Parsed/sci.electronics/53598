From Bill Mayhew Subject Re receiver system One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies you'd have Hz per channel sampling That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep A commercial hand held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the Obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown OH USA phone
