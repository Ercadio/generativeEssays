From jmichael Subject Re solvent for duct tape adhesive Acetone will likely damage the First solvent to try is denatured Do not waste your time with rubbing You can use methyl alcohol instead of denatured If you want to have a cocktail while you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol If the alcohol does not work try carbon If neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent but the alcohol works for most Good Jim
