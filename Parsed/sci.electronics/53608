From jra John Ackermann x Subject Single chip receiver for FSK My next project is to come up with an IF detector module for fast to kB sec packet radio No fancy modulation scheme just wide FSK for use at or I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola chip but I wonder if there are newer designs that might work at higher input My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the I'm particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than do any current chips work up to say with internal downconversion so a normal IF filter can be used Any suggestions John John Ackermann Law Department NCR Corporation Dayton Ohio Packet Radio tcp ip
