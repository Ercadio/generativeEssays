From TOM WAGNER Wizzard of old Audio Visual Campus Subject Re Why circuit boards are green In article Geoff Swan writes In article TOM WAGNER Wizzard of old Audio Visual Campus writes The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were Phenolic spelling was a tan Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are Filled fiberglass is Teflon is The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound used to make These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red or orange boards are a two part epoxy or a liquid imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different There's a lot of info about the pro's and con's of each but that's another Sla n go fo ill Risky Geoff Swan research development Megadata Pty Ltd Waterloo Rd North Ryde NSW v Fax Sorry Geoff Agree solder mask is green but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering machines which are another topic again I had a crew of a dozen ladies which could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning Board under the mask was the original BTW cheap inport electronic devices mainly from world countries are done with brown pheonolic Is seems the electronics industry has discovered the cheap labor Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at They are very obviously hand Quite a few tape recorders are being brought into Canada from Red In China there is no warranty for the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's One of my co workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was almost Also the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular printing An old lithographer friend had a press for After the etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on Tom Tom Wagner Audio Visual Malaspina College Nanaimo British Columbia Loc Fax Callsign Weapon Kentucky Rifle Snail mail to Site RR Nanaimo British Columbia Canada I do not I keep everything All standard disclaimers apply
