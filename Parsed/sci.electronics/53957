From Andy Collins Subject Voltage regulation and current limiting One not so quick question to throw out there for you For our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs Voltatge adjustable from Current limited at Voltage must stay within of designated value for I from AC ripple less than mV rms Of course we can't just use an adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip Our problem is with the current limiting we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit What the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one Thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one If we measure the current through a ohm resistor at we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the So does anybody have any ideas we could work from Thanks in Andy Collins ps If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project I agree fully but I still have to do it its graded
