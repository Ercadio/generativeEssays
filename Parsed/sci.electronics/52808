From RICHARD WHITE Subject Re Help with ultra long timing In article du writes I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to What I am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state What they want to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six Every two weeks they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the Then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold degrees and a power source that wouldn't I have looked at the XR timers and the standard dual timers but thier temp specs won't go that Also two weeks equates to seconds per firing which means one big timing cap I have found farad yes Farad caps that have a working voltage of volts and are small in But again the time of discharge at or lower degrees isn't I was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the One possibility would be to use solar panels but this is during the six month Anyone have any good ideas Thanks in Wes just a suggestion take a motorola set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a RC or xtal clock then feed to a as clock input and decode output for sec output might have to add a few 'and' gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the' to restart Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet these ckts require uAmps of current between volts so a volt gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six Then take the ckt board battery wrap in or of foam or build a box of out of the plywood or metal build a small heater out of Watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts thought use batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet Insolate though the chips state that the AL rated devices are good to The batteries have a considerable reduction in make sure the area inside has minium air hope this helps RW is this to long winded for the net be gentle
