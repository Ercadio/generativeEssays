From webb Webber AH Subject Re Adcom cheap products Aaron Lung wrote I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where But if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so Good I wouldn't be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior As long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldn't matter where it is Definately I agree If they can build the amp where the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier as Adcom has I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last not with those quality components Sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna The amp you have probably is running Class A the whole Actually I'd be wary of excessively hot amps 'cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs Sure I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated the amp sounds My Adcom GFP runs fairly warm not hot to the touch but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running I don't like it when an amp runs dead It makes one think that the amp is doing nothing The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for skimpy they're massive things with heating vents both below and More than enough to carry away excessive My opinions once Alan Webber The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by Apprehension creeping like a choo train up your spine Will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
