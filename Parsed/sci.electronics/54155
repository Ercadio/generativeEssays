From Alan Mimms Subject Re UART needed really BREAK detect In article Jim Cathey wrote In article alan Alan Mimms writes Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a character containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its This True enough means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot which basically indicates a There is no special way to detect BREAK that I have found other than this there's no magic signal generated by UARTs Zilog SCC Break Detect This is a very popular part but it has a number of quirks especially in HDLC Signetics DUSCC RSR Break Start Detect RSR Break End Detect Two of the bits in the Receiver Status You can enable an interrupt on either of these bits going high Also only one NULL will be put in the FIFO per break This is simply the best serial chip I've ever worked Many less quirks than the SCC which is IMHO second Death to devices And I thought I knew a lot about serial Perhaps I should just keep my big mouth Alan Mimms apple alan My opinions are generally Portable Macintosh Software Group pretty worthless but Apple Computer they are my Art without engineering is Engineering without art is Steven Roberts in Computing Across America
