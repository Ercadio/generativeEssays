From Victor Laking Subject Re Info on NEC Multisync monitor myers Bob Myers writes I am looking for any info I can get on the NEC I know that it is a multisync but that is about I plan on buying one second hand in a while depending on its Does anyone know the min max frequencies whether it is interlaced non interlaced or both video compatability etc I have seen a reference to it being pitch with X resolution and that it supports SVGA from one source and that it doesn't support SVGA from another Neither source seemed to have much reliable info so I don't want to take a I'm at home right now and so am away from my monitor files the following is off the top of my head subject to revision worth what ya pay for it sort of If you don't hear from anyone who has spec sheet in hand e mail me and I'll look it If I'm remembering correctly the is a mm pitch multisync that covers at least VGA kHz horizontal Hz vertical to x Hz which is going to be about kHz horizontal It may go somewhat higher than that on the horizontal but you won't be happy with anything beyond x on a tube you probably won't be too thrilled with the x on this tube but it will sync up and display I prefer at least a for this Since SVGA is it'll do that The horizontal range probably goes lower than but I don't know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSC rate TV which need about kHz sweep As far as video compatibility if I'm reading the question right it won't take anything but analog RGB In other words it has no way to decode NTSC or Y C video You would need some sort of board to to this conversion like the sorts of things that let you display NTSC on a VGA Hopefully now I'll see this response of mine and it'll remind me to look this stuff up and confirm Or force me to post a hasty retraction Ok I was under the impression that it accepted digital I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and non interlaced as I have gotten conflicting The Inquiring Mind BBS Winnipeg Manitoba
