From Victor Laking Subject Re Info on NEC D Multisync monitor myers hpfcso FC HP COM Bob Myers writes I am looking for any info I can get on the NEC D monitor I know that it is a multisync but that is about all I plan on buying one second hand in a while depending on its specs Does anyone know the min max frequencies, whether it is interlaced, non interlaced, or both, video compatability, etc I have seen a reference to it being pitch with X resolution and that it supports SVGA from one source and that it doesn't support SVGA from another source Neither source seemed to have much reliable info so I don't want to take a guess I'm at home right now, and so am away from my monitor files the following is off the top of my head, subject to revision, worth what ya pay for it sort of info If you don't hear from anyone who has spec sheet in hand, e mail me and I'll look it up If I'm remembering correctly, the D is a mm pitch multisync that covers at least VGA kHz horizontal, Hz vertical to x Hz which is going to be about kHz horizontal It may go somewhat higher than that on the horizontal, but you won't be happy with anything beyond x on a tube you probably won't be too thrilled with the x on this tube, but it will sync up and display it I prefer at least a for this resolution Since SVGA is x , it'll do that too The horizontal range probably goes lower than , but I don't know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSC rate TV which need about kHz sweep As far as video compatibility if I'm reading the question right it won't take anything but analog RGB inputs In other words, it has no way to decode NTSC or Y C video inputs You would need some sort of board to to this conversion like the sorts of things that let you display NTSC on a VGA display Hopefully, now, I'll see this response of mine, and it'll remind me to look this stuff up and confirm it Or force me to post a hasty retraction Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and non interlaced as I have gotten conflicting info The Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba
