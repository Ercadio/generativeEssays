subject re fm transmitter ics help from robert ganter in article writes i am trying to design a small 90mw 472mhz fm transmitter for remote alarm

> > please reply to > yes and no. i would use the fm transmitter chip from motorola (linear and interface databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. sbl-1 from mini circuits lab). everything is done in the fm chip and then mixed up with the oscillator frequency. just have a look at the arrl handbook. there are lots of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. i don't think, there are single chip designs for such high frequencies yet. > thanks in advance.
