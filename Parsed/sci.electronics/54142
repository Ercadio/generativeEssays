From Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article Caleb Strockbine Could make for some interesting light and sound could be controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancers on You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage Can you tell us more about what you're doing Sounds like a very cool Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this I have yet to chose a tracking The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the I did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone And dancers stand still alot so their IR signature goes The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of said This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga used with a LIVE video This works with a video camera trained on the You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an Events can be MIDI objects or sequences Amiga sounds or graphic It's been fun to play with but the documentaion is arcane and the digitizer is Still it's very appealing the dancers don't have to wear any appliances you can have ots of zone s it speaks MIDI which can be used to control lights and I don't have to build any It's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic but I have
