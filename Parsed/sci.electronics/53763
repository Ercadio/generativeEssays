From willisw Bill Willis Subject Re Mysterious MOSFET In article Scott Dorsey writes I have a MOSFET pulled out of a Trygon power supply for which I have no It's a Motorola part with a date code and the number which the Motorola folks assure me is a house number which they can't help me Any suggestions from folks out there I can't put it on a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent since it's completely scott Since your MOSFET is a vintage it's probably not a very good one by today's If you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better Early MOSFETS had a gate source voltage rating of approximately VDCmax and they would usually turn completely ON at Otherwise MOSFETS are not really mysterious they're more or less voltage controlled current If the MOSFET in your circuit is used as an open loop voltage controlled current source you may have to experiment with various gain altering Bill Willis
