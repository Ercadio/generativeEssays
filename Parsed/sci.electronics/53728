From Adrian Godwin Subject Re Single chip receiver for FSK In article C L xM E law DaytonOH NCR COM jra law DaytonOH NCR COM John Ackermann x writes My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other I'm particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than do any current chips work up to, say MHz with internal downconversion so a normal IF filter can be used GEC Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators SL etc for use in satellite TV receivers or MHz in, MHz of baseband video out I think there's also a related data slicer clock recovery circuit intended for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common implementation it may not be in volume production The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those in the US so it may be worth investigating locally available receiver designs to find out what's in common use adrian Adrian Godwin g hwn gb khw ObDisclaimer I believe this rubbish don't imagine that anyone else does
