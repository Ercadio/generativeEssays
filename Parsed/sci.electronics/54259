from john ruckstuhl subject solvent for duct tape adhesive i know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent i should use to clean duct-tape adhesive from carpet?
someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out. is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax?
(whatever that is ... but it just barely ties this query into sci.electronics) thanks for your help
best regards,
ruck
