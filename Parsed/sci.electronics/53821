From TOM WAGNER Wizzard of old Audio Visual Campus Subject Re Suggestions on Audio relays In article Aaron Lung writes In article Billy Quinn writes I built a little project using the radio shack relays to switch I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing I was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the My question is Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio I will appreciate any advice or references to Also exact part numbers company names for the relays will help Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre amp out level signals Also are the clicks you mentioning the big clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact bounce How are you driving the relays TTL gate output Switching transistor How are the relays connected to what you are driving Need more specifics to answer your question As a general rule no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the In high impedance audio circuits a resistive T is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the Grounding the imputs connected to the T transfers the In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used and the inputs are shorted out or Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching Telephone relays are handy because contacts can be adjusted to Make before break and Vica Versa but I haven't seen any of these for Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive optical isolator It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp all packaged in a When the lamp is off the cell is high Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the Once again this device in a T switches the Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume Use variable resisters and you have a mixer Lots of luck Tom Tom Wagner Audio Visual Malaspina College Nanaimo British Columbia Loc Fax Callsign Weapon Kentucky Rifle Snail mail to Site RR Nanaimo British Columbia Canada I do not I keep everything All standard disclaimers apply
