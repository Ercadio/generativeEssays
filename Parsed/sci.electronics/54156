From Carlos Puig Subject Re Analog switches Balanced Demodulators Michael Fulbright writes I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and I've hit a In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an op amp amplifier from to controlable via a digital The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches to adjust the gain of the op The only analog switch I have experience with it the Unfortunately I want to switch an AC signal which goes from about to and the is only for positive I have recently used the to switch a bipolar I simply ran the off a bipolar supply in this As long as your analog input signal stays between the supply rails the will work Of course your control logic input must use as the logic LOW and as the logic HIGH reference so that either all your driving logic must be CMOS with the same bipolar supply or you must provide some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the and the control In my case I was able to use the bipolar supply all the Carlos Puig San Jose CA
