used those little self-contained modules. i think sharp made them.
radio shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.) the module had 3 leads: power, ground and demodulated output. it
contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator
all in a tiny metal can. if you want to buy one, try radio shack, or else a tv repair shop can
probably order one. btw - the carrier frequency is 40 khz, and each
different tv/vcr/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
scheme to perform each different function on their equipment. jim ritterbusch - or - (temp, rf)
there is an art, the guide says, or rather a knack to flying. the
knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
