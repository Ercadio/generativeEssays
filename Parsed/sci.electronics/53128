From Eric Taylor Subject Holes practical questions was Philosophical Question In article Jim Carr writes I I come at this from nuclear physics where one often discusses particle hole excitations and certain reactions have the effect of applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole and it is a subtle The longer one works with them the more real they There are also quasi particles which raise the same sort of question about how real the entity The phenomenon is most certainly a real OK I've asked this before and with a new thread on these lines I ask this again If a large hole current is run thru a resistor will there be I R cooling instead of heating Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies hole currents over normal electron currents what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual test samples rather than estimates based on Also don't be limited to semiconductors consider also insulators resistors dielectrics piezo electrics conductors magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc NOTES to summarize this thread has so far stated that the only area where holes are not detectable is the That is hole particles only exist in the presence of Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain semi The question that naturally arises is if the hole currents inside a semi conductor vanish at the point where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor say copper I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether holes could exist inside metal conductors rather I ask for an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such currents if they Also note that I have cross posted this to since this is now becoming an electronic Thanx ET A Force of Nature
