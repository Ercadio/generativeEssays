From Dave Medin Subject Re Suggestions on Audio relays In article Billy Quinn writes I built a little project using the radio shack relays to switch I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing I was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the My question is Is there a good relay relay circuit that I can use for switching audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio I will appreciate any advice or references to Also exact part numbers company names for the relays will help The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component intentional or not on the audio lines to be If neither the output or input presents an unintentional DC level let's say they're capacitively coupled then putting a K resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the DC before switching with coupling capacitors of your If you have more than one relay each relay switching one input through to a common output you can use make before break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch This may mask the switch An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor LDR sealed inside a piece of black Many broadcast consoles use this older but time honored Claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this but I don't have a part number Radio Shack has a LDR grab bag you might want to For a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try looking at the analog switch that is commonly available or its older predecessor the Again the DC component must be removed prior to Other alternatives include JFET switches both discrete and IC and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly All the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi page Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes Techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the control With the cutting the click can be as simple as putting resistors in series with the control Hope this helps at least get you Dave Medin Phone w SSD Networking h Intergraph M S Internet Huntsville AL UUCP ingr catbyte dtmedin Everywhere You Look at least around my office The opinions expressed here are mine or those of my machine
