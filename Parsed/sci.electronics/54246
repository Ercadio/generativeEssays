From Rod Nussbaumer Subject Re multiple inputs for PC In article U Can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem I am having I have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode DTMF tones and send the resultant in ASCII to a These boards run on the serial I need to run of the boards somwehat I need to be able to ho ok them up to a PC The problem is how do I hook up serial devices to one PC inexpensivley so that all can send data simulataneously or close to it Any help would be greatly appreciated Abhin Singla If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder the ideal comunications would be over a multi drop system like RS RS boards are available for PC's probably cheaper than a bunch of RS channels and RS is cheaper to build onto your satellite modules using only a single supply pin DIP driver Software at the PC end would be similarly complex for either RS or RS in my The higher data rates possible with RS would permit quasi simultaneous data Hope this Rod Nussbaumer Programmer Technologist Bitnet BOMR TRIUMFER TRIUMF University of British Columbia Internet Vancouver BC Phone ext
