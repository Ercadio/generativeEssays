From Mike Harpe Subject Re How to drive an array of LEDs Phil Torre writes I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed individually by a microprocessor say, x or so Is there an LSI that is designed to drive an LED array including RAM to hold the array state , or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have to latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch I want to avoid having a huge board covered with s if possible Thanks in advance Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want The MAX drives segment LED displays with full decode or drives discrete LED's with a wire serial interface The chips can also be cascaded to allow very large arrays I am working on a sign display using this part I'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later, it's at home There was a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Ink's Mike Harpe Michael Harpe, Programmer Analyst Information Technology, Ormsby Bldg University of Louisville Louisville, Ky He's not a man, he's a remorseless eating machine The Simpsons
