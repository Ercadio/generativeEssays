From Henry Spencer Subject Re In article marxhausen paul writes OK what's a quick rundown on all the series variations We're repairing something with a on it and the question arises well do i really need the ACT part Flipping through Digi Key I see ALS AS C HC AC ACQ ACT HCT ACHT Here's something I posted about this a few years It's not fully up to date with all the new variations some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms In practical terms ignoring the technological details this is my view of the families NB I am not a giant corporation which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility The Speed good power consumption Effectively obsolete now use or later except for a very few oddball functions like which are hard to find in newer Modification of for higher speed at the cost of higher power Very obsolete use Modification of for lower power at the cost of lower Very obsolete use Later modification of for even higher speed at some cost in power Effectively obsolete use Combination of and for speed comparable to with lower power Best all round TTL now widest variety of Fast as blazes power not too The clear choice for high speed in Availability and prices generally Failed competitor to although a few parts do things that are hard to find in and thus are still Possible replacement for Generally souped Still fairly new availability and prices possibly a Fairly old family CMOS devices with TTL Competed with series not too Obsolete use or newer CMOS Thrown in as the major non non ECL logic The old CMOS family still viable because of very wide range of devices low power consumption and wide range of supply Not Very forgiving and easy to work with beware static electricity but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too There are neat devices in this family that exist in no The clear choice when speed is not A new attempt at pinout Fast compared to old CMOS power consumption often lower than Possibly a good choice for general purpose logic assuming availability and CMOS logic levels not TTL Beware very limited range of supply voltages compared to older CMOS also major rise of power consumption at faster with TTL logic Much the same comments as Read the fine print on things like power consumption TTL compatibility in CMOS involves some Thrown in for speed The low end of Various sources claim that it is easier to work with than super fast TTL for serious high speed Less forgiving though read and follow the rules or it won't Availability to hobbyists limited can be For real speed Hot Harder to handle than and inconvenient Much more useful datasheets As for compatibility between families the families except and are all more or less logic level compatible but how many devices you can drive from one output varies enormously with X and You just have to read the specs and do the and are compatible with the others with a bit of compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage is or to anything else is considerable Me I use and with a sprinkling of T and are interesting but I haven't used either significantly All work is one man's Henry Spencer U of Toronto Zoology Kipling utzoo henry
