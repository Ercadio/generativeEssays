From Aaron Lung Subject Re Adcom cheap products In article webb Webber AH writes I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where But if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so Good I wouldn't be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior As long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldn't matter where it is I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last not with those quality components Sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna The amp you have probably is running Class A the whole Actually I'd be wary of excessively hot amps 'cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs aaron
