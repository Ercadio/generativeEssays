From Wes Whiteley Subject Re solvent for duct tape adhesive I have used a product called Goof off it comes in a little yellow can about the size of a deck of playing cards It has worked well for removing all kinds of sticker and tape NOTE always test a small area in an inconspicuous place before Good luck Wes Whiteley
