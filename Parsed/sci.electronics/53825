From Thomas David Kehoe Subject Re Telephone Controlled Power Bar Needed I had a similar idea for a fax answering machine switch to put both machines on one You order distinctive ringing from your phone This is month You get a second unpublished phone When someone calls this number your phone rings with short rings instead of long You set up your answering machine on rings and your fax on six You'd give out the new as your fax A device would measure the length of When it detects a short ring it turns off your answering Five rings later your fax picks up the This should be cheaper and more elegant than the switches now But that's not what I I'm giving out the new to my friends and This should leave the old for telemarketers I won't pick up the phone when I hear the long Why my thoughts are my own when they are in but when they are out they are another' Susannah Martin hanged for witchcraft Thomas David Kehoe
