From Stan Burton Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article Duane P Mantick writes Duane Yeesh you WILL be nailing those May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens IRLED This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a It will output nearly a watt mW with REAL short duty cycle nice thing about the is that it is I got mine for about cents a piece even though I had to buy of Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost recovery on I may be I think for practical and cost reasons I am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to extend BTW I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company The watter ain't cheap around but if you want some power mamamia that's pretty They also have a watt a watt and a watt device in their line and will sell small to If you are interested I can find the book at home and get the pertinent Yes I'm interested in the company I have access to an extensive data book With that kind of power are we getting into an area where eye safety is getting to be a Now as for the position detector you might try ELTEC in Phone number listed in the ETID is They seem like nice Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you They are a long way from me but they might be a better source than I can find around I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to I'm keeping my application confidential for Raising the frequency should be no problem in fact one respondent to my question said that I may not have to mimic the duty cycle normally used by IR detector Stan Burton DND CRAD DRES DTD MSS AGCG DRE Suffield Box Medicine Hat AB Canada
