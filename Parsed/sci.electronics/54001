From Stan Burton Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article Duane P Mantick writes Duane Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH IRLED This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit It will output nearly a watt mW with REAL short duty cycle times nice thing about the SFH is that it is CHEAP I got mine for about cents a piece, even though I had to buy of them Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost recovery on I may be interested I think for practical and cost reasons I am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to extend range BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to watts honest, WATTS I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company name The watter ain't cheap, around but if you want some power, mamamia, that's pretty hot They also have a watt, a watt and a watt device in their line, and will sell small quan to individuals If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info Yes I'm interested in the company name I have access to an extensive data book collection With that kind of power, are we getting into an area where eye safety is getting to be a problem Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida Phone number listed in the ETID is They seem like nice people Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices, so they might be able to help you out They are a long way from me but they might be a better source than I can find around here I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to KHz I'm keeping my application confidential for now Raising the frequency should be no problem, in fact one respondent to my question said that I may not have to mimic the duty cycle normally used by IR detector chips Stan Burton DND CRAD DRES DTD MSS AGCG DRE Suffield, Box , Medicine Hat, AB, Canada, T A K
