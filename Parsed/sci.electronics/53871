From Randall Elton Ding Subject Re ADCOM IR sensor repeater spec's In article John Rasper writes Does anyone know the details of the interface wire din for the IR remote sensor wire IR repeater for the ADCOM GTP preamp The ADCOM part numbers are the XR SPM and IRA A cursory physical examination of the pre amp connector indicates that the connector pin din may provide Viewed from connector front pin v mA pin v mA pin Signal Ground pin Demodulated signal V pp polarity mA drive pin Signal to drive repeater LED drives through resistor V pp I assume that the repeater connectors mini plugs drive the IR repeater LED's True Can anyone fill in the ' Here's the When you get your home brew receiver working would you be willing to share it with the rest of us I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design pin signal ground pin signal pin always hot volts pin volts hot only when preamp is turned on pin infrared repeater connectors The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the pin connector pin There is a ohm resistor between the two jacks with a from pin to The signal pin in the preamp is summed with the built in IR They use a chip called and a BJT to amplify the I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external If you need more info let me Randy
