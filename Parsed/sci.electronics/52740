From Robert Stephens Subject Compressor Problem I have a stereo compressor limiter by Audio Logic Model MT The gates work but the compressor seems to be gone on one channel and very weak on the I'll probably need an ocsilloscope to trace it down no pun intended but if any one with experience with this type of equipment could point me in a certain direction as to where the circuit is most likely to fail I'd sure appreciate Robert Stephens Human Factors Research Lab University of Minnesota
