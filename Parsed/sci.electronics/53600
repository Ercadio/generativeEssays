From Gary Gendel Subject Re A question about outlet In article writes In article Russ Crisp writes Here's my It seems to me that I'd have the same electrical circuit if I hooked the jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding What's wrong with my reasoning here What you CAN do if you want three prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper In fact depending on where you are putting your new outlet s a GFCI may be required You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter So rewiring is still a part of this job however the ground may be connected to a local earth ground rather than back at the breaker As Jamie said GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places most notably bathrooms and outside the I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets rather than the You will end up with much less Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the GFCI devices do save lives if you decide to install them be sure to check them regularly using the test button Running the family business electrical supplies and lighting for many years I have seen too many seasoned electricians fried because they forgot to double check their common sense Please exercise Gary Gendel Vice President Current consulting assignment Genashor Corp Mentor Graphics Corporation Piney Woods Drive Independence Boulevard Belle Mead NJ Warren NJ phone phone fax email
