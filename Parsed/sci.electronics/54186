From Tomi H Engdahl Subject Re flash LEDs with sound In article There's a seeker born every writes Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency Is there any easy way to do either of these I'm looking for the simplest circuit I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of color organ but not Let me trt to explain Look for information about tone decoder It is an easy to use chip for detecting sound of certain You need only one and some other componets for each led you want to The chip can take the voltage levels which the casette Radio Shack Archer Semiconductor Reference Guide gives good information how to use that It should be simplest way to The chip costs something like LOWERY'S LAW If it jams force If it breaks it needed replacing This text is provided as is without any express or implied warranty
