From baden de bari Subject Phosphorescent pads A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about x or so that could be plugged into something and they would glow One was red, another green, another blue Interresting I was wondering if anyone would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price oh, the pads were rubber like and were floppy like, about cm thick or so Thanks Inspiration comes to o those who seek the Baden de Bari unknown
