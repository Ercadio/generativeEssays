from baden de bari subject phosphorescent pads a while ago i saw some translucent pads, about 6"x8" or so that could be plugged into (something) and they would glow. one was red, another green, another blue. interresting. i was wondering if anyone would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price. oh, the pads were rubber-like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or so. thanks. _________________________________________________ inspiration | ___ | comes to | \ o | those who | ( ^ ) | seek the | /-\ =] baden de bari [=    |
