From Paul Malenfant Subject Optoisolator interfacing questions I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on to my cpu board which runs at The optoisolator is a On the led side I put the signal I want through a resistor to the base of a On the transistor side I tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull up resistor of It functions OK but seems VERY I can detect pulses that occur at about but not much Isn't the rise fall time of this device something like I should be able to detect my target of but I can't get This is done using wire wrap and the wires going to the cpu and to the test pin are about inches long but I'm not doing anything high In the Art of Electronics it mentions tying the base of the phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the Is that what I need to do How do I calculate the resistor value Paul Malenfant pmalenfa
