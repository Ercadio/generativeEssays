From Dale Farmer Subject Re Building a UV flashlight John Hawkinson wrote Yes I know it sounds Call it an Call it what you Just don't ask why Anyway I'd like to build a UV flashlight flashlight means it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they need a lot of power I'm not too concerned with whether it's long wave or short wave but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs I'll take both Check out a medical supply catalog the thing you are looking for is called a woods lamp so you can check for woods sign certain skin conditions flourecse sp under UV light They come in disposable penlight like types and larger ac powered It is also used in eye examinations a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye then UV is shined on it shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to for the completest the dye is called flouescien and in normal light appears orangish and leaves a mild burning sensation to the eye for minutes until the tears flush it all Have Dale Farmer
