From Subject Re Lead ACid Batteries Part In article writes In article writes In article David Vanderbyl writes lots of stuff deleted The lead acid secondary cell discharge reaction is I am glad you do not dispute this If you don't want the lead storage battery to discharge it should be stored such that its charged state is the equilibrium During winter the ground be it covered with concrete dirt or wood maintains a cooler temperature on average than the surrounding air or the The heat capacity of air is less than that of concrete dirt or wood so it heats Conversely air cools faster The normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated garage or The storage surface is often cooler than the surrounding air with the battery temperature somewhere in the basement air temperature may be F the floor temperature F and the battery temperature The air temperature is HIGHER than the battery The heat of reaction is not going to move up the The floor temperature is LOWER than the battery temperature and heat is going to move to The floor is an incredible heat Might depend on where you live I know locally for most of the winter the ground and concrete floor within sheds and garages unheated is signifacantly warmer than the average air The air does get warmer during the day but during the night the ground and concrete is definitely warmer especially when protected by the walls from the albedo And the nights are longer by several hours than the rest of quoted text deleted Jeff White Richard Dell Sorry about following up my own article but I wanted to continue that what might be being missed here is that the important thing might not be temperature differences per se but the action of heat sinking the Perhap someone could conduct an experiment taking two identical lead acid batteries placing both on wooden shelves but putting one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat This would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect' and keep both batteries at the same ambient I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent but the one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have some Richard Dell
