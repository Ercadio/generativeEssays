From Michael LaB Subject Re Adcom cheap products Off shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van Alstine and better than Hafler and Forte' , but at a much lower cost How do you spell tuna helper I gather by off shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by blue fin tuna's who are into that squid fi sound I agree on that one My Adcom preamp did sound better after installing the famous running the chips class A resistor mod , and replacing the metal bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority with Adcom, else the mods would neither have been necessary, nor would they have improved what was already touted as superlative state o d art le'sound I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up from an sp II even an sp a to a GFP etc , or maybe from those that have dumped their forte' amps for a GFA etc
