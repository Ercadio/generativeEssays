From David Vanderbyl Subject Re mysterious TV problem source LLBGB writes Initial symptoms no picture or sound CRT filament does NOT glow flyback ticking as described abovew Discovered when hooked up the scope IF strip is not putting out audio or video signals everything is making simple Hz pulses horiz out transistor collector case of the TO is a Hz downgoing sawtooth with ring at front end guys WHAT S GOING ON HERE Anyone seen this before What is happening is this You turn the TV The horizontal output begins normal This powers up the high voltage and most of the rest of the A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts After it powers down the cycle Things to check First check for a shorted high power Your best bet is the vertical output transistor s or if there is one the voltage The most common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn Also look for shutdown circuits which your TV may or may not have if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from
