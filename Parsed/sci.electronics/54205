From Mike Diack Subject P programmer Having vainly looked for devices capable of dealing to the NEC P DSP chip which dont require taking out a mortgage, i decided to roll my own Not a difficult task for an , given that all the timing relationships are set out in the databook One thing bothers me, that is the accursed ms volt Vpp pulse Sure, a little buck step up converter can achieve this in what is otherwise an all volt widget but i know latterday eproms dont need nearly this pulse length Q has anyone come up with a more efficient programming algorithm which is failsafe cheers Mike
