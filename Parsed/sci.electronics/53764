From Mark W Kubovich Subject Common mode noise and small signals I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using Analogic has some relatively large common mode noise on I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference several hundred The has about mVp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about How can I get rid of the noise When I look at the spectrum using an HP audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation' on the I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to Also if I use a differential amplifier IA to solve the problem how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from to about I would appreciate
