From J Babb Subject Re Electric power line balls In article A , Scott Townsend wrote I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate some net wisdom His question is about some diameter balls which are attached to electric power lines in his area He's seen up to a half dozen between two poles Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles I'll bet there's a runway nearby Jeff Babb Programmer, SDSU LARC
