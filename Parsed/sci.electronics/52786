From Smith Subject Voltage Multiplier Hi I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor voltage multiplier to step the supply voltage up to approx As the load resistance increases the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage I need as high an output voltage as about The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie diodes and capacitors each capacitor develops about across them and I take the output from across seven capacitors Each capacitor is at If I increase each of the capacitors rating that will increase the RC constant and hence alleviate some of the These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need of them So What would happen if I connected a at capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven capacitors Will it as I assume increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant If it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then I will have killed two birds with one as I am experiencing some ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this and Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the mains Lowest resistance possible I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a I'm at university and I've got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron it'll be cheaper too in the long especially if new large capacitors don't work as planned Email Can't always read the Thanks in Chris Name Mr Chris Smith Twang on that 'ole guitar Addrs Uni Liverpool University Quest To build more and more hardware Dgree Computer Science What ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas All views expressed are my own and reflect that of private
