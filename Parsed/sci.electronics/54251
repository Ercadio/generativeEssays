From arnief sail LABS TEK COM Arnie Frisch Subject Re Luser In article A Seema Varma writes Hi, I am looking for a high speed D to A converter at least bits and MHz for testing a chip any ideas on where I can find such a monster A paper in the January issue of IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits authors from Philips Eindhoven mentions a GHz, bits, GaAs DAC they use in their testing, so I know that such circuits are around somewhere TriQuint Beaverton, Oregon , has been selling an bit, GHz D to A for several years I have used it and it works well, faster settling time and smaller glitch area than any video d DACs I have seen Also, they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale now it's somewhere in the to bit area at GHz Arnold Frisch Tektronix Laboratories
