From arnief Arnie Frisch Subject Re Luser In article Seema Varma writes Hi I am looking for a high speed D to A converter at least bits and for testing a chip any ideas on where I can find such a monster A paper in the January issue of IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits authors from Philips Eindhoven mentions a GaAs DAC they use in their testing so I know that such circuits are around TriQuint Beaverton Oregon has been selling an bit GHz D to A for several I have used it and it works well faster settling time and smaller glitch area than any video d DACs I have Also they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale now it's somewhere in the to bit area at Arnold Frisch Tektronix Laboratories
