From John De Armond Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do swalker man writes I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool I hope someone can help The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft exploiting the venturi Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water Warm river water coming from the steam condenser in the plant is sprayed over The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft It should be noted that the hourglass shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear It should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful the cooling towers are only used part time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to Fishermen know that is thoroughly Nontheless stringent usually state regulations remain in some Since it typically takes hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a MWe plant the cost of using the towers is not John De Armond Interested in high performance mobility Performance Engineering Magazine TM Interested in high tech and computers Marietta Ga Send ur snail mail address to for a free sample mag Lee Harvey Oswald Where are ya when we need ya
