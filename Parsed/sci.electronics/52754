From John Whitmore Subject Re Help with ultra long timing In article John Haddy writes In article Michael Covington writes Don't use big They are unreliable for timing due to True especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by times or something like Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant Low power quartz oscillators are usually kHz and THESE have significant temperature drifts which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency MHz or so and take more battery Programmable timers might be less accurate but they are more power stingy than suitable crystal John Whitmore
