From Dave Mc Mahan Subject Re References for ANY IC In a previous article Keith Ledig writes I am looking for a text reference that will include pinouts description and functionality for just about any IC Does such a text exist Are there docs on the Internet that reference IC's It would be a great idea if each major IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text ala RFC style This would save time and money for the IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send around the world via internet and since most users of IC's are found in the internet Are there any books available for purchase that reference as many as possible Or am I going to be stuck obtaining a zillion databooks from the manufacturers those little phonebook type books that are obsoleted every couple years We use a CD ROM based system There are about CD ROM disks and a disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS DOS It contains scanned images of data book pages for several thousand When you ask it for something it knows about mostly active IC parts it works quite THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that It is definately a start in the right direction but they need to expand the data base to handle more types of These systems aren't We paid about for the liscence and get monthly updates of some of the CD ROM We send the old ones back to them so that they will keep sending us the I think we pay a yearly maintainence fee of about to get the If you find the part you want you can look at the data sheet on a page sized monitor it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems You can also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet Page printing takes a couple of minutes per It can take a while to dump the or pages you usually I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available to all Internet dave Dave McMahan
