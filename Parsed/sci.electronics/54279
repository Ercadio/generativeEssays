From David Vanderbyl Subject Re Lead ACid Batteries Part The lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction Pb Lead and Lead IV Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water heats of formation deleted The heat of reaction at C is therefore kcal per mole Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble grams per grams water at C and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the I am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but I may be Oh well I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate and I don't feel like thinking through it right The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate Also is in a water solution as and Thus the heats of formation of and are for the most part What is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing More about this What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this we're talking lead acid batteries of course The battery slowly self As this discharge takes place two things The level of Pb ions in the acid solution increases the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved The level of ions in the acid solution decreases the solution becomes less acidic or more like water if you like Now as the post to which I am responding correctly stated will precipitate in a WATER non acid When the battery dies is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of Pb and in So forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the If there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part They can dissolve the but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates You may have some success with these products for a newer stuff deleted To understand why lead acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall LeChatelier's Principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable Here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials stuff deleted This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into Removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to If the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat A concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood Store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher A logical consequence of the above argument is this If you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to to 'pull' the reaction We all know from experience at least those of us in Canada do it gets cold up here that this is not If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the Besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the The air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or This is of course irrelevant since you would WANT the battery to be cool during Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged
