From STEVE GROSS Subject Re How to the disks copy In article Kuo Sheng Kasey Chang writes In article Guido Klemans writes In article Kuo Sheng Kasey Chang writes byteocide What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup REGISTERED TO XXXXX address city state zip and disables the Two benefits encourages registration cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable because if the patch's registration message is encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus violated their license You take two copies with a different registration id compare them byte for byte and you know where they are Usually you will be able to find out what is what after Probably but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch NOT Sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes but WHY It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from And what keeps me form registering as John Doe from the company Public Domain Yellow Brick Road Tinseltown or something Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion I'm saying that you register via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you the patch which includes the info you put on the registration Kasey Chang I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address When the user registers you don't even need to send executable code just compute his her key and send him her instructions to enter in the appropriate place the following Name Joe Doe Address Main Street City Anytown CA key ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd Every user needs a unique The executable can propagate as much as you like the author can respond to the registration by e mail post card Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name showing up maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message Authorized users can make as many copies as they like upgrade their machines The main motivation here is guilt and irritation at seeing someone other than yourself as the registered owner
