From Neal Howard Subject Re Lead Acid batteries Concrete In article Michael Covington writes In article Carter Ames writes Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminals are I asked a friend and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them but he couldn't tell me This topic was beaten to death a year or so The concrete is not the Lead acid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long time but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster That's why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self discharge even The best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow cycle the charge in the Such mild exercising of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for If you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells when you refill the This isn't so critical for a brand new battery in a fully charged state but will maximize the restored output of an older battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for Neal Howard ' XLH DoD CompuTrac Inc Richardson TX doh Std disclaimer My opinions are mine not CompuTrac' Let us learn to dream gentlemen and then perhaps we shall learn the August Kekule'
