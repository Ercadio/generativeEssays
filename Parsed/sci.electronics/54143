From Glenn A Sullivan Subject Re Need help with video detection circuit Steve Verity writes I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video a blank screen by monitoring the R G and B outputs of a graphics It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at MHz which would mean detecting a NS It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about mv and a dim screen say around mv Oh yes it also needs to be In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this Try a differential Put back to back diodes between the collectors restrict the voltage Have mA flow with ohm collector Rs and keep the stray C below Try Run collector to your Allen Sullivan
