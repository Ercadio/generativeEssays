From Glenn A Sullivan Subject Re Need help with video detection circuit Steve Verity writes I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video Vs a blank screen by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics card It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at MHz, which would mean detecting a NS pulse It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about mv and a dim screen say, around mv Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only mv I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work Try a differential amplifier Put back to back diodes between the collectors restrict the voltage swing Have mA flow, with ohm collector Rs, and keep the stray C below pF Try N s Run collector to your logic Allen Sullivan
