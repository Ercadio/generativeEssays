From Wayne Schellekens Subject WANTED DRAM Controller for use with For an upcoming project I want to use Megs of DRAM configured as two Meg banks of bit I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the It's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching that part is The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook edition I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my BTW if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip the Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer It uses the SPI bus and refreshes controls up to of DRAM It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is Price is from Dallas quan I wish I could use this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is MHz too slow for Thanks in advance Wayne Schellekens Wayne Schellekens Internet AECL Research Whiteshell Laboratories Twisted pair
