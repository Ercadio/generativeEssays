From Glenn Elmore Subject Re Single chip receiver for FSK John Ackermann x jra wrote My next project is to come up with an IF detector module for fast to kB sec packet radio No fancy modulation scheme just wide FSK for use at or I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola chip but I wonder if there are newer designs that might work at higher input My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the I'm particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than do any current chips work up to say with internal downconversion so a normal IF filter can be used Any suggestions John What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the ARRL Computer Network Conference I built watt FSK transceivers at They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at The receiver uses the which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the Mbps GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL The which includes a VHF converter section could also be used at these There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this the if I remember rightly While using this would have let me reduce the external IF count on receive it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with The radios I built were first designed and built for kbps in a MHz channel but later reduced to half These kbps radios actually have done quite well in across the bench tests at kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter Handling the data stream is another matter Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a beacon test While there is not yet end end two way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings data is perfect copy at Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed the a kbytes of the test text chapter of Isaiah takes only a little over of a I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time money and If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn overlooking Si valley The antenna is horizontally I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your target If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line of sight I think you'll want to address the inter symbol interference caused by multipath and probably link C N budgets if paths are very far from For more details see the I'm currently working on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these I'd be glad to help as I can with any design Glenn Elmore amateur IP glenn Internet
