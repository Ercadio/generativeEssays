From John Haddy Subject Re Help with ultra long timing In article C wI G A athena cs uga edu , Michael Covington writes Don't use big capacitors They are unreliable for timing due to leakage Instead, use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by times or something like that MHz divided by cycle per weeks, approximately I wouldn't expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic capacitors to fail at C or F for that matter either The battery is going to be your big problem Also, of course, your circuit shouldn't depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal controlled timer won't Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that, as a mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the compliance terminology of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency Michael A Covington internet Artificial Intelligence Programs phone The University of Georgia fax Athens, Georgia U S A amateur radio N TMI JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney, AUSTRALIA Email , Ph , Fax
