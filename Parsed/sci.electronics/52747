From John Haddy Subject Re Help with ultra long timing In article Michael Covington writes Don't use big They are unreliable for timing due to Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by times or something like MHz divided by cycle per weeks I wouldn't expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic capacitors to fail at C or F for that matter either The battery is going to be your big Also of course your circuit shouldn't depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal controlled timer won't Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant Michael Covington internet Artificial Intelligence Programs phone The University of Georgia fax Athens Georgia amateur radio JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney AUSTRALIA Email Ph Fax
