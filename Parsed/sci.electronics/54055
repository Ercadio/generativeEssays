from caleb strockbine subject re long distance ir detection in article writes i would also be interested in the application here. i work with a dance and technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot wide stage from 50 feet away. could make for some interesting choreography... light and sound could be controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage, or by the number
of dancers on stage. neat. you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage! can you tell us more about what you're doing? sounds like a very cool program. caleb strockbine
