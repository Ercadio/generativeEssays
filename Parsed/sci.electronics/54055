From Caleb Strockbine Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article writes I would also be interested in the application I work with a Dance and Technology program and want to build something to track dancers on a foot wide stage from feet Could make for some interesting light and sound could be controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancers on You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage Can you tell us more about what you're doing Sounds like a very cool Caleb Strockbine
