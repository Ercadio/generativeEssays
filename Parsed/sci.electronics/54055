From Caleb Strockbine Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article A writes I would also be interested in the application here I work with a Dance and Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a foot wide stage from feet away Could make for some interesting choreography light and sound could be controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage, or by the number of dancers on stage Neat You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage Can you tell us more about what you're doing Sounds like a very cool program Caleb Strockbine
