From Bill Mayhew Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do Just to complete that thought the cooling towers cool water that circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer energy from the reactor's cooling turbine etc reactor The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive contamination of the the turbine The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of the turbine feedwater with atmospheric contamininats Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil fired and nuclear generation Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown OH USA phone
