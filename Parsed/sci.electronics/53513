From Chris Best Subject Re Need help with car Just a shot here but ya never know I once bought a REAL cheap equalizer power amp for my car tape player at one of those motel room truckload sales and it sounded For a while that Then one channel quit I opened it up and the amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder joints attaching it to the I soldered them back and it worked I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did Probably lousy heat You said a nice Alpine which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher in quality than the I But the point is look inside before you scrap it since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can Maybe even the same thing I Good luck
