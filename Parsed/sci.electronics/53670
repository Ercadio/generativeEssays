From John Nagle Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do Wayne Alan Martin writes Excerpts from Apr Re What do Nuclear Site's by R Tim From R Tim C Subject Re What do Nuclear Site's Cooling Towers do Date Fri Apr PDT In article swalker man wrote I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that this board would be most I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are I hear that they're called 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot As I recall the water isn't as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as Hence big cooling Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to Some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource Everybody runs closed cycle The water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is John Nagle
