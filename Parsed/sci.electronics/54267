From Warren Gaiewski Subject Re D G H type Amplifiers in article Mark Yeck writes Hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers Just a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be I have the clues on type A B and AB already and stuff but these other ones are mentioned occasionally and I dont know what they I think type D is like a PWM scheme or Thanx in The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved Class D amps are PWM pulse width modulation amps which work very much like switching power I think I've seen these things called class S before as They're capable of very high efficiencies and would be suitable for very high I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile amp I've been trying to design a three kilowatter for the last year to be used as an inverter for an UPS but have been having serious problems with layout parasitics IRF 's in any help with a do able isolated drive ckt would be appreciated I'm not absolutely positive about this but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that operates off a variable or switched power supply rail The Carver amps do something like They use some sort of phase control circuit I do not fully understand its operation to reduce the transformer size and I beleive that is I had an apart trying to fix and found that it had three rail voltages that it switched I ran a simulation on PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat under large signal conditions or when driving reactive loads which draw high current at the zero voltage crossings Think Diode Great sound starts with The Source
