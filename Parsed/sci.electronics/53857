From Ed Hall Subject Re Building a UV flashlight In article John Hawkinson writes One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about near UV light being cheaper to get at than actual UV Does anyone know what he was referring to I don't want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other postings near UV light is actual UV The near means that it is close to the visible spectrum of relatively long wavelength not that it is nearly I'm sure you can figure out now just what far UV Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV Stronger sources are going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor Be careful though strong UV sources can cause physiological damage especially to the The shorter wavelengths are the most It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable It would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously Ed Hall
