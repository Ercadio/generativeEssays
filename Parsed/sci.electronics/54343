From Peter J Demko Subject Re PC parallel I I O From article by baden de bari Alan Erickson writes I'm trying to bring in bits to a PC and would like to use interrupt driven Without buying an IO board or making a new port where can I bring in these bits LPT seems to have only a few inputs but I've heard rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional Anybody know fer sure If any bi d LPTs which boards have them I'll be running a new Yes it is I'm making a stepper controller board with digital inputs and up to digital outputs from the One main thing that will tell you whether the port is bi directional or not is the bus tranceiver on Look for a chip numbered If you don't have this then it's probably a which will do you NO good for reading Now if you do have the ' then do the following First find the address of the port decimal either or In pascal you would Write Port xxx where xxx is the address in either hex or The status lines pins as well as the strobe pin are bi directional lines and are read by base address so for to read from status then read from You can also output to these lines in the same fashion as to the data In pascal do Port xxx value Hope this Let me know if you need more Inspiration comes to o those who seek the Baden de Bari AS IT HAPPENS YOU'VE HELPED ME QUITE A I'M CONSIDERING BUILDING A VERY SIMILAR DEVICE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO THIS THE IDEA IS TO CODE THE OUTPUT BITS INTO MULTIPLE BIT CURRENT AMPLIFIED OUTPUT SOFTWARE WILL HANDLE THE WAY THE AMPLIFIED OUTPUTS ARE MANIPULATED SO THAT THIS MAGIC BOX CAN HANDLE MORE APPLICATIONS THAN JUST STEPPER ALSO LOOKING FOR A ROBOT ARM CHEAP TO ATTACH THIS BOX TO SO I CAN WOW AND IMPRESS MY ANY HINTS PETER J DEMKO
