From Glenn A Sullivan Subject Re How do you build neural networks Matthew D Moss writes In other words is there some sort of neural network circuit I could build after a visit to a local R Shack Marvin Minsky hi there writes of building perceptrons in the using motor driven potentiometers to vary the He reported that the circuits worked even tho there were wiring Can you say ROBUST Cadium Sulfide cells vary with CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID somewhat linear yet somewhat limiter transfer function often Low power Schottky gates and earlier gates has about a gain of LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells even at a few And paper with dark and light regions controlled by pencil and eraser could also control CdS The very high input resistance of CMOS gates may let you charge up paper mylar caps to serve as Allen Sullivan
