From John Haddy Subject Re Oscilloscope triggering In article Jeroen Belleman writes In article David Glen Jacobowitz writes Is it just me or does anybody else out there NOT like digital My school has David Jacobowitz Oh no you're not the only Analogue scopes give you or me at least a fair idea of what's going on in a Digital scopes seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of even when there are only a few samples per period our displays a continuous waveform complete with non existing I've waded through lots of manual pages and menus but I haven't found yet how to turn this It doesn't show which points have actually been measured as opposed to those which have been interpolated Perhaps you're using the wrong brand Sorry all HP fans but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their excellent gear One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition being able to lock the instrument into real time capture Secondly I don't like I want to see all common functions with their own You'll have guessed I love analogue Tek scopes I'd choose a knob with printed legend over an on screen display with up down buttons right The single knob of most digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function at the right I agree with you The only consolation is that manufacturers are beginning to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the However to be fair it seems that first time scope users our students seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a real scope Last but not least you never know if the waveform displayed is old or recent noisy or just incoherently modulated heck you don't even know if it really looks the way it's Digital scopes only show you a tiny fraction of what's going Most of the time the're busy computing This is one area that newer DSOs are I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek their which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard analogue This instrument has a s spec meaning that it is always in real time capture The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the The downer is that the instrument uses menus again but at least they appear to be logically laid There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital scope Looking at what happened before the trigger looking at rare events and acquiring the data to have my computer play with Let's hope scope manufacturers are Best regards Jeroen Belleman One more thing about the new simpler front These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs This is a vast improvement over the old oak The single most common cause of failure in our scopes other than students blowing up inputs is mechanical wear on these I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney AUSTRALIA Email Ph Fax
