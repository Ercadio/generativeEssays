From Duane P Mantick Subject Re IR remote control receiver writes If you want to buy one try Radio Shack or else a TV repair shop can probably order BTW the carrier frequency is KHz and each different TV VCR cable box stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse scheme to perform each different function on their Some TV's including my RCA set at home uses simple carriers which I think run between and or There is no tone decoding in All one has to do to piss the thing off is just hook an IRLED up to a variable oscillator and tune Wreaks all kinds of Similarly my VCR remote changes channels on my cable Always seems to change the cable box to channel when you do the pause SOOOO some things do have some overlap to Duane
