From Duane P Mantick Subject Re IR remote control receiver writes If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can probably order one BTW the carrier frequency is KHz, and each different TV VCR cable box stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse scheme to perform each different function on their equipment Some TV's, including my RCA set at home, uses simple carriers which I think run between and or KHz There is no tone decoding in it All one has to do to piss the thing off is just hook an IRLED up to a variable oscillator and tune through Wreaks all kinds of havoc Similarly, my VCR remote changes channels on my cable box Always seems to change the cable box to channel when you do the pause play SOOOO, some things do have some overlap to them Duane
