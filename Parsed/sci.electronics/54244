From Bill Mayhew Subject Re Laser vs Bubblejet There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the Newer printers have a gray or white plastic The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last I don't have the information I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet The kit was fairly You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet now that prices have declined so Upgrading an original deskjet to requires a fair amount of skill but no Upgrading a deskjet plus to a is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor Contact your HP service center for further The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers especially the newer laser The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan This makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated As you might guess the result is hideously slow The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular From the way Wordperfect works this would not be easy to Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows' The dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of An uncompressed image could be as large as about Kbytes but the printer needs about of memory for its internal house Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet A single page from a laserjet only requires about This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet The presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warm up Until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is I won't use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is Chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a Energy waste could use more Warm up times have decreased allowing stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner The image drum is good for approximately It is a very nice print I wish HP used the Kyocera Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP's laser The pick up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP Replacement cost for the transport is almost The feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own It depends upon the application which printer is best for If you only print or pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good As noted the deskjet is my choice for personal Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown OH USA phone
