From David Vanderbyl Subject Re Police radar Just how does it work In article A , Dave Medin writes In article A , Michael DeAddio writes The 'beam' is split in two, with one beam aimed at the target car sort of and the other at the ground The speeds of each are calulated for the final number Actually, this is true on the more expensive ones, but the cheaper ones just read the speedometer I've never seen a speedometer reading model Are you sure Who makes them Consider the difficulty of reading the speedo on various makes of cars in use I've seen single beam moving mode and split beam moving mode Obviously the police officer reads the speedometer I cannot believe the nit picking in this group There's beams, there is not, is too, etc Dave Medin's line sig deleted
