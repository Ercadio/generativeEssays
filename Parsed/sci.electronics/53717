From Stefan G Berg Subject Re Motorola XC RC and RC In article APR Stich, Christian E writes I just installed a Motorola XC RC FPU in an Amiga A board MHz with capability to clock the FPU separately Previously a MC RC was installed and everything was working perfectly Now the systems displays a yellow screen indicating a exception when it check for the presence type of FPU When I reinstall an MC RC the system works fine, but with the XC even at MHz it does not work The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data strobe Ohm might help, but that didn't change anything Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do Does this look like a CPU FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead it is a pull, not new Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC RC I thought that the RC were labeled MC not XC for not finalized mask design Are there any MC RC I, too, have a XC RC math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer clocked at MHz I have tried clocking my FPU at to MHz and it all worked just fine I have a MC CPU I don't know why my FPU has an XC my original MHz FPU was label MC , but it seems to work fine on my system Maybe you just have a bad chip Stefan P S Or does it mean eXperimental Chip instead of Motorola Chip
