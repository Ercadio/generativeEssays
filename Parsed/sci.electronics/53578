From Martin Kaschke Subject Band Equalizer I was wondering if anyone out there in net land knew of a SIMPLE way to make a band equalizer single channel I need it to accept LINE inputs tape deck, CD player, etc and output to the same So input impedance should equal output impedance Also, since I am driving a line, I would need volt p p output Final requirement is that I can either Control it digitally OR Control it easily, or with few resistors FINALLY If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips, that might be useful, please let me know I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL, and MAXIM Thanks in advance, Martin
