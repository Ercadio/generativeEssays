From Martin Kaschke Subject Band Equalizer I was wondering if anyone out there in net land knew of a SIMPLE way to make a band equalizer single channel I need it to accept LINE inputs tape deck CD player and output to the same So input impedance should equal output Also since I am driving a line I would need volt p p Final requirement is that I can either Control it digitally OR Control it easily or with few resistors FINALLY If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips that might be useful please let me I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL and MAXIM Thanks in advance Martin
