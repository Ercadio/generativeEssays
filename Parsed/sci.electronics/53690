From Cyberman Subject Re Analog switches Balan Michael Fulbright said Analog switches Balanced to All on MF I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and I've hit a MF In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an MF op amp amplifier from to controlable via a digital MF The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches MF to adjust the gain of the op The only analog switch I have MF experience with it the Unfortunately I want to switch an MF AC signal which goes from about to and the is only MF for positive How about using a it has a seperate ground for the analog It would get you MF Another part which caught my eye was the Analog Devices This MF is a balanced demodulator which appears to fill exactly the need I MF The data sheet was somewhat skimpy on application Could MF someone comment on using this chip for the following application Or how about a multiplying D A convertor This is essentiallty what you are Stephen Cyberman Mangled on Fri at Catch the Blue Wave Blue Wave QWK
