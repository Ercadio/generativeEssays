From bill nelson Subject Re Power, signal surges in home Douglas S Rand writes Hams can legally run up to watts It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car Ham rigs Not possible either You'd need about a amp alternator for just the amplifier I can just see it You need to slow down on a downgrade, so you hit the push to talk button Well amps anyway Transmissions are generally for a short interval The battery would supply the rest Of course, if you transmitted too much, you would run the battery down It really would not be that much of a brake Even at efficiency, watts would only consume horsepower Bill
