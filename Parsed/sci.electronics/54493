From Bill Mayhew Subject Re WD as moisture repellant was Lead Acid batteries C I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke multimeter suggests applying WD to the test lead sockets especially the current range The intention is to prevent the test lead is in the wrong scocket beeper from going off when there is no test lead in that The manual is a bit vague but I think I'd apply the WD to a swab then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly from the Speaking of said meters I compared the against the that I've had on my bench for almost It has been five years since the has been On the DC scale they agree within AC scale is within about The would be just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale I didn't feel it was worth the extra for a second since I don't use dB all that much in my Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown OH USA phone
