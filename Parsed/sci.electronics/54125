From David Vanderbyl Subject Re Lead Acid batteries Concrete Neal Howard writes The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster That's why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self discharge even There are a number of inaccuracies here In fact a colder battery will self discharge more This is why batteries should be stored in a COOL dry An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed on The battery the wood and the concrete will all be at the same general temperature ignoring temperature fluctuations and thus none will effect the The best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow cycle the charge in the Such mild exercising of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for There is no need to 'exercise' the Just keep it A trickle charger will do the stuff deleted
