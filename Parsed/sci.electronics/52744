From SOH KAM YUNG Subject Re Protection of serial lines Martin John Gregory wrote I've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments and have seen a variety of schemes for protecting the transceivers and the rest of the circuit from transients on the serial I'm left wondering what is the best way of doing this How necessary is it stuff deleted What is the wisdom on this out there Ta From what I know protection is necessary if you plan to route the cables into an unknown environment out of your control Things like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables or even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see the sight of your computer going up in smoke Even ethernet cards are I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is protected by a gas discharge tube But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings in controlled environments it should be reasonably safe not to have Suggestion look in the RS data They have several transceivers that have overvoltage Among them include the and and The Maxims are suppose to be electrically isolated ones but still need opto isolators to work don't ask me I've never used them Another alternative is an surge Two are listed in the RS If you need additional info stock just e mail Soh Kam Yung
