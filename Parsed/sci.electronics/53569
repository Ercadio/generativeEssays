Where do I buy stuff Subject Introduction Disclaimers Although we've done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you If you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don't do it Contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical Electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or Furthermore our discussion is based on the National Electrical Code NEC and the Canadian Electrical code CEC To the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don't quote sections simply to keep this thing If you think we're wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references The NEC and the CEC do not in and of themselves have the force of Many municipalities adopt it en Others however do Check your with your local building department and provincial Hydro Inspection Offices in Canada to find out what applies in your Also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service Bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family Multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments are sometimes governed by different Also note that contrary to popular belief in the and in some parts of Canada Canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the Consequently the NEC does not apply in Lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of But there are a number of crucial differences in the Where we can we've noted them flagging the relevant passages with NEC'' or CEC'' Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal It is often smart to go beyond their minimal Subject What is the NEC Where can I get a copy The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the National Fire Protection Association an insurance industry It's revised every three The version has been You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at The code exists in several There's the full text which is fairly There's an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most And there's the NEC Handbook which contains the authorized commentary'' on the code as well as the full That's the recommended Unfortunately there's no handbook for the abridged And the full handbook is expensive US plus shipping and Subject What is the CEC Where can I get a copy The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other The CSA publishes CSA Standard which is updated every two or three Each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code Since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA standard In this FAQ CEC really means the appropriate provincial In particular this FAQ is derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code edition Which is in turn based on CSA edition While differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to Ontario The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power In Ontario it's Ontario The Ontario Hydro book isn't overly It's about C and includes mailed I hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent NEC Don't bother asking in Quebec DIY wiring is banned throughout the Subject Can I do my own wiring Extra pointers In most places homeowners are allowed to do their own In some they're Check with your local electrical Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's homes for money without a Nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial Multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial However many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to If you do your own wiring an important point Do it NEAT and WELL What you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will After all it's your own home and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make a An electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it's reasonable and will impress the The inspector will know that you're an You have to earn his The best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as Don't cut Exceed Otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest Don't try to hide anything from the Use the proper Ie don't use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your The inspector won't like it and the results won't be that And it takes And you're more likely to stick a hunk of wire through your hand that Don't handle house wire when it's very cold eg below or Thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very Subject What do I need in the way of tools First there's the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and Phillips If you're lucky enough to live in Canada or find a source of CSA approved devices you need Robertson square recess screwdrivers and instead of For drilling a few holes a or spade bit and or electric drill will If you're doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a drill right angle drills are Can be rented and or screw point auger drill These bits pull you through so they're much faster and less fatiguing even in year old hardwood Screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well For stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire Don't buy the K mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener You should expect to pay to for a good plier type It will have sized stripping holes and won't nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with One model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw There are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren't necessary and pros usually don't use A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted Don't use these for stripping You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire You should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it's better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more If you're using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the Or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath You shouldn't try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it's too easy to slash the insulation on the Apparently Stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you'll gouge the For any substantial amount of work with armored cable it's well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter US Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the Three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired About Multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most A simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about US at Radio You should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on Neon bulb version are cheap and work If you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a Though I've been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops For running wires through existing walls you need fish Often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will Fish tapes can be Electrical Lots of it Seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little The tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair Another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws I don't do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate Subject What is UL listing The UL stands for Underwriters Laboratory It used to be an Insurance Industry organization but now it is independent and non It tests electrical components and equipment for potential When something is UL listed that means that the UL has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock It doesn't necessarily mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to just that it probably won't kill The UL does not have power of law in the you are permitted to buy and install non UL listed However insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non UL listed Furthermore in many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is UL listed for that Indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be UL listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits Subject What is CSA approval Every electrical device or component must be certified by the Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with CSA approved They perform testing similar to the UL a bit more stringent except that CSA approval is required by Again like the UL if a fire was caused by non CSA approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the In Canada there is a branch organization of the UL called ULC UL of Canada ULC does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance Subject Are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring USA The following three books were suggested by our readers Residential Wiring by Jeff Markell Craftsman Books Carlsbad CA for ISBN Practical Electrical Wiring Residential Farm and Industrial Based on the National Electrical Code ANSI NFPA Herbert Richter and Creighton Schwan McGraw Hill Book Wiring Simplified Richter and Schwan Park Publishing Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC Which is currently Canada Knight authors and publishes a book called Electrical Code Simplified There appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial It focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for Canadian DIY' It is better to get this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net It is updated each time the provincial codes This book is available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C Subject Inspections how and what Why should I get my wiring inspected Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is Amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a California for instance is particularly nasty about If fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage In general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a You should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on This is a good time to ask questions on any things you're not sure If you're doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other At this point they will tell you which inspections you will If you're installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a This is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual After installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in After the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection Subject My house doesn't meet some of these rules and Do I have to upgrade In general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases However any new work must be done according to the latest electrical Also if you do major'' work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your Check with your local electrical Subject A word on voltages One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a One person might talk about another or another These are all in fact exactly the same In North America the utility companies are required to supply a split phase volt feed to your This works out as two Additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it's not unreasonable to find has dropped to or has dropped to by the time the power reaches a wall Especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit For a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them and except when actually saying what the measured voltage will Confusing A Just ignore One thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie instead of What this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that is not the same as is the voltage between phases of a phase Y circuit that is from neutral to any is the voltage between phases of a phase Y circuit that's from hot to In keeping with versus strangeness motors intended to run on three phase are often labelled as Subject What does an electrical service look like There are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with Three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the Watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe This is the grounding conductor It is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to This wire normally carries no One of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black It is the neutral It is connected to the centre tap CEC center tap in the NEC of the distribution transformer supplying the It is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel The neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere Otherwise weird and or dangerous things may Furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a Some codes require more than one grounding These will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding Adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to If you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection However in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your The other two wires will usually be black and are the hot They are attached to the distribution transformer as The two black wires are degrees out of phase with each This means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be If you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into This is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire only service Subject What is a circuit Inside the panel connections are made to the incoming These connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the There are three different combinations one hot one neutral and ground two hots no neutral and ground two hots neutral and ground circuit neutral and or two circuits with a common is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both and or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution is usually for special motor circuits electric heaters or air Note In the US the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar to be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main When connected to most sub panels prong plugs and receptacles are required In our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the NFPA claims that this practice was re evaluated for the NEC and found to be Check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for and have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in a white wire for You will sometimes see wired with just a black white and ground Since the white is hot in this case both the NEC and CEC requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live Usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or There are in a few locales circuits that look like or except that they have two bare ground Some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor This may or may not be an alternative to GFCI Subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC the grounding conductor is for the safety ground the green or bare The word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot Since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor However the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the But not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main In the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor This FAQ uses neutral simply to avoid potential We recommend that you use neutral Thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications Not Subject What does a fuse or breaker do What are the differences Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe For example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from As such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won't cause a Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the Fuses trip relatively Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current For motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary A fusetron looks like a spring loaded A fuse can only trip once then it must be Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical They usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another When the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and By bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts Circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary With high overloads they trip Breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the Thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the Neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per A dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe Subject Breakers Can't I use fuses Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker This is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny Since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high When a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting Result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn Breakers don't do Many jurisdictions particularly in Canada no longer permit fuse panels in new The NEC does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses Some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the The fuse is there to protect the motor windings from Check the labeling on the This is usually only on large permanently installed The installation instructions will tell you if you need Subject What size wire should I use For a amp circuit use gauge For a amp circuit you can use gauge wire in most locales For a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage gauge is only slightly more expensive than gauge though it's stiffer and harder to work Here's a quick table for normal Go up a size for more than foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate heat easily Gauge Amps We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire Subject Where do these numbers come from There are two considerations voltage drop and heat The smaller the wire is the higher the resistance When the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the The former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long Neither effect is very significant over very short There are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is The obvious one is the line cord on most Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger Subject What does mean This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a The first number specifies the The second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there's usually an extra ground means gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare wire usually has a black white and bare ground Sometimes the white is red instead for circuits without In the latter case the sheath is usually red wire usually has a black red white and bare ground Usually carrying with Subject What is a wirenut marrette marr connector How are they used A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used to connect wires Marrette or Marr connector are trade You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY In essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the wire do it anyways it's more mechanically and electrically There are many different sizes of wire You should check that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your Use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and Sometimes it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut Some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical This is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an It's usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be Subject What is a GFI GFCI A GFCI is a ground fault circuit interrupter'' It measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral If they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a Any of these situations is hazardous so the GFCI trips breaking the GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric If for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a GFCI wouldn't All of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the GFCI The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not One is labeled LOAD the other The incoming power feed must be connected to the LINE side or the outlet will not be The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices downstream from Thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single GFCI Subject Where should GFCIs be used The NEC mandates GFCIs for or single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within ' of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water or There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space'' typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry The CEC does not mandate as many In particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement Basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they're near the door to Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection you may want to consider installing it Unless you need a GFCI breaker see below the cost is In the GFCI outlets can cost as little as US Costs are a bit higher in Canada C Evaluate your own risk Does your finished basement ever get wet Do you have small children Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools Does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage Subject Where shouldn't I use a GFCI GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that a don't pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of Refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good The rationale is that GFCIs are sometimes prone to nuisance Some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the Note though that most GFCI trips are real if you're getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you'd be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the GFCI is broken or Subject What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker For most situations you can use either a GFCI outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in The former is generally preferred since GFCI breakers are quite For example an ordinary GE breaker costs US the GFCI model costs US There is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit'' two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a Canadian style kitchen circuit you'll need a multi pole GFCI Unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you But if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no One more caveat GFCI outlets are You may want to use an oversize box when installing On second thought use large actually deep boxes You'll thank yourself for Incidentally if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don't really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not GFCI anything upstream of But protecting the whole circuit is When you install a GFCI it's a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the You can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the GFCI with the test button and see which outlets are Subject What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then Apart from their use in electronics which we won't comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won't turn on without a good ground connection they're intended to guard against insulation failures within the Generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground If there's an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process If the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you're grounded you'll get Of course if the circuit is GFCI protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use GFCIs to replace ungrounded outlets both NEC and CEC There are some appliances that should never be In particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed Consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you're not grounded nothing will If you're slightly grounded you'll get a small shock the resistance will be too But if the case were grounded and you were holding it you'd be the perfect path to Subject Why is one prong wider than the other Polarization Nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the This is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios Most prong extension cords have wide prongs This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way You want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one Most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the If not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects Subject What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen The NEC requires at least two amp small appliance circuits'' for The CEC requires split duplex Outlets must be installed such that no point is more than NEC mm CEC from an Every counter wider than NEC or mm CEC must have at least one The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining Furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting Non dedicated outlets within ' of a sink must be protected by a GFCI NEC only Split duplex receptacles are fed with a The tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower The neutral connects to both outlets through one When carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream Subject Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light All such outlets must be GFCI Subject What is Romex NM NMD What is BX When should I use each Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated Sometimes called non metallic The formal name is This is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive Most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with NM There are several different categories of NM BX cable technically known as armored cable or AC has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic Protection for cable in concealed locations where NM or AC cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least CEC NEC from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical This latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or Note inspector permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically Additional protection recommendations these are rules in the Canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the NEC and CEC NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under feet from the Ie use AC instead flexible conduit wooden guards Where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be Canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of AC cable or NM cable in flexible conduit to jump to the Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass NM cable shall be supported within ' of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than ' Holes in joists or studs are considered supports Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical conductor NM cable should never be stapled on Knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar cable should be protected where it runs behind Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall In places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a UL or CSA approved metal You use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the Service entrances frequently use a plastic In damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg CEC NEC UF looks like very heavy duty You will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the See underground wiring Thermoplastic sheath wire such as NM NMW should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist The reason for this is that if there's a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US except that Canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in Eg versus AC In the US NM B is degrees NOTE local codes This is one of the items that changes most Eg Chicago codes require conduit everywhere There are very different requirements for mobile Check your local codes especially if you're doing anything that's the slightest out of the Wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted Condition Type CEC NEC Exposed Concealed dry plastic NM armor AC Exposed Concealed damp plastic NMC armor Exposed Concealed wet plastic armor Exposed to weather plastic NMWU TW armor Direct earth burial plastic NMWU UF Service entrance RWU TWU armor NMWU not for service entrance Subject Should I use plastic or metal boxes The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable The reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor plastic boxes don't use metal cable The CEC is slightly The CEC never permits cable armor as a grounding However you must still provide ground continuity for metallic The CEC also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little On the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to For exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably Subject Junction box positioning A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible Ie not buried under Excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get Subject Can I install a replacement light fixture In general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few First of course one should check the amperage rating of the If your heart is set on installing half a dozen watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel But there are some more subtle constraints as For example older house wiring doesn't have high temperature The excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire You may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling You may need to install a new box specifically listed for this A across the ceiling joists makes a good Metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat When these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually ' made by making a pair of joists high and covering with plywood that doesn't have any Yes that's feet long NEC rules are somewhat less They require at least clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a CEC style coffin'' might be Presumably that's up to the local The CEC doesn't actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get accidentally buried in Ie if you have insulation blown in There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in They are usually limited to watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older Before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such Follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in The coffin appears the only legal Subject What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is Depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than and the other less than with respect to This is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some US jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral If this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the Note a brief second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same with neutral A loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one In case of doubt get Subject What is phase power Should I use it Can I get it in my house Three phase power has three hot wires degrees out of phase with each These are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence You're most likely to encounter a phase circuit that shows volts between any hot and ground and volts between any two The latter shows the difference between a normal common neutral circuit which is volts between the two There are phase circuits with different Bringing in a phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or If the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is MUCH cheaper to buy a new or motor for In some cases it is possible to run phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto These are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to The Taunton Press book The Small Shop'' has an article on how to do this if you Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a The laws of thermodynamics guarantee Subject Is it better to run motors at or Theoretically it doesn't make any However there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply All things being equal a motor will lose times less power in the house wiring than a This also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed And in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than feet Subject What is this nonsense about on circuits It is a universal physical law that HP is equal to Given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider HP is going to need A circuit can only deliver watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately Given rational efficiency factors is more like Some equipment manufacturers Sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a HP rating that is far in excess of what is They are giving you a stall horsepower or That means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it's drawing far more current than it can When comparing motors compare the continuous This should be on the motor If you can't find that figure check the amperage rating which is always Subject How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong Older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern These receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground Neither the NEC or CEC permits installing new prong receptacles There are several different approaches to solving this If the wiring is done through conduit or BX and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle NEC mainly CEC frowns on this If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it's continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third Run a ground conductor back to the main Easiest install a GFCI The ground lug should not be connected to anything but the GFCI protection itself will serve The GFCI will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets If you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected Since it wouldn't be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of prong devices connected to other Be sure though that there aren't indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on BX The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the U ground with a non conducting Like caulking This is not permitted in the Subject Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets Should the test button work We're sure about what the NEC and CEC Remember though that your local codes may As for the TEST button there's a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST Current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the This is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn't require a real ground to If your GFCI does not trip when you press the TEST button it is very probably defective or Again if the test button doesn't work something's broken and potentially The problem should be corrected The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground wire must be We do not know why they say The causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of UL or CSA listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being On the other hand UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet One of us called Leviton their GFCIs are labeled for installation on grounded circuits The technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the NEC does not require it and promised to Subject How should I wire my shop As with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on The code specifies that you should stay under of the nominal capacity of the For typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop Use at least gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up If you can use amp breakers NEC though CEC requires standard receptacles which means you'd have to replug all your Lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate The idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand RPM while you're groping in the dark for the OFF Do install lots of It's easier to install them in the beginning when you don't have to cut into an existing It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really But use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit Note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for What this means is that all wiring must be run along structural Ie stapled to Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits circuits for some large tools and air compressor Don't overload circuits and don't use extension cords if you can help it unless they're rated for high A coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same Also the insulation won't withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from If you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a If you want to install individual switches to safe'' particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high For example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table Buy horsepower rated'' switches Finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs And even if you know'' that you'd never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different Note Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop April is one place to Subject Underground Wiring You will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don't use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead The transition from in house to underground wire is generally via All outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings If the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is And of course don't forget the The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific A hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been Subject Aluminum wiring During the 's aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively Since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new We recommend even if you're allowed to that do not use it for new But don't panic if your house has aluminum Aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as Aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep When aluminum wiring warms up it When it cools down it Unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each To make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes Which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still Eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to and possibly even cause a Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 's we will cover basic points of safe aluminum We suggest that if you're considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things Fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for The device will be stamped with Al Cu or CO ALR The latter supersedes the former but both are These fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary Wires should be properly connected at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction Connections should be While repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance It should be push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum Any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections There should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked Any such damage should be Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled Current Canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to The NEC requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant The tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the Any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail See Shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire If when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring If there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look If the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from to per receptacle You can do this yourself Subject I'm buying a house What should I do It's generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden Not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as If an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed If there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look Here's some hints on what to look for Obvious non code wiring can include Zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls Hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper Ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a GFCI Splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube Switched neutrals Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines Certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations Switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall except when it's really convenient Switches and outlets in bizarre locations Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling Backwrapped grounding wires Subject What is this weird stuff Old style wiring In the years since Edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and When you buy an older home you may encounter some of this This section describes the old methods and some of their The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called knob and tube K T It is made up of individual conductors with a cloth The wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs Wire is run through structural members using ceramic Connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with Since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather A neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the In some cases K T isn't colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot You'll see K T in homes built as late as the ' Comments on K T the people installing K T were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty The wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very Most K T I've seen for example is in quite good No Grounding is usually difficult to boxes are Receptacle replacement particularly with GFCI can be No bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any Building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain K Connection to existing K T from new circuits can be Consult your Modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than K T systems Since K T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't necessary to replace it simply because it's K What you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit In many cases it's perfectly reasonable to leave existing K T alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern After K T they invented multi conductor The first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish It looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or This stuff was used in the 's and ' Again no grounding It was installed much like modern Its major drawback is that this type of insulation We've seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a BX cable of the same vintage has similar This stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become This wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink After this wiring technique the more modern romex was It's almost a asphalt impregnated Often a bit This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work It does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation Just don't abuse it too Subject Where do I buy stuff Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near Their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or DIY
