From DAVID HAAG Subject Re Pink Noise In article David Sharpe writes Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all This is in most cases around the Hz Pink White are used to adjust for room dynamics and stuff like There are a few EQ's out on the market that have Pink noise built Most all from Audio Control have them I know the C With regards to what you wrote how does one adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that I asked a professor that question just last week and he didn't really know Since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states say the surface of the Silicon where there's a lack of a covalent bond that act as traps to nearby elecrons and since this happens at low frequencies because at high frequencies they aren't able to trap electrons how do you compensate for that It seems to me that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink I have seen the pink noise feature however on many EQs and I was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to man made noise like power lines crosstalks coupling If you have any information about this it would be Hope this didn't sound too drawn David
