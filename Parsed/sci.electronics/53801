From Corwin Nichols Subject Re Fujitsu HDD The Fujitsu uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface Storage Module Device A lot of older minis used Sun still does on their server There are several different speeds of SMD and I think that the Fuji drive you have is rated at about Mb sec thats megabits There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC Interphase in Texas being one but I think that the market pretty much has dried Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available but I think that it was designed for slower SMD In other words if you have a PC or Mac that drive is pretty much Cheers Corwin
