from ogawa taro stephen ise subject help wanted could someone please tell me if a decoder is the same as a 1 to 4
demultiplexer. i know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit,
but how do i link 5 of these to make a 1/16 multiplexer. sorry if this
seems like a lame question, but i'm only a newbie to electronics, and i
have to do this circuit. please make any mail as droolproof as possible. thanx, taro ogawa ()
