From willisw willisw ENG CLEMSON edu Bill Willis Subject Re Acceleration sensor In article A Michael DeAddio writes Does anyone know of any type of acceleration sensor that has an electrical output of any sort It would only have to sense acceleration in one direction Thanx, Mike Michael DeAddio MTS Work hard, play hard, Bell Communication Research the only problem is that playing hard makes working harder MRE Q SETRA SYSTEMS, Nagog Park, Acton, MA , Ph Schaevitz Engineering, US Rt Union Ave , Pennsauken, NJ Ph Accelerometers are not cheap, mainly because the outputs are fairly linear with respect to acceleration You don't say what the range of acceleration you want to measure is, and there are other ways in which to measure it other than using an accelerometer Additional information would be helpful to anyone who may respond Call, if you wish
