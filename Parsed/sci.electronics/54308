From Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article A , Glenn A Sullivan writes I designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level from a tone detector upon detecting a microwatt LED feet away Used a Motorola MRD , biased linearly in a DC feedback loop to servo out variations in sunlight and Hz from lights Used no lenses Allen Sullivan I would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware What did you use for the detector Could you detect the angle of location, or did the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors field of view
