From Subject Re Long distance IR detection In article Glenn A Sullivan I designed and built hardware in that would output a logic level from a tone detector upon detecting a microwatt LED feet Used a Motorola biased linearly in a DC feedback loop to servo out variations in sunlight and from lights Used no Allen Sullivan I would be interested in knowing more about the sensing What did you use for the detector Could you detect the angle of location or did the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors field of view
