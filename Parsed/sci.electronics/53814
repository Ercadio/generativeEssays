From Wout Serdijn Subject Re how can uF be different from two in series In Apr Princeton EDU Michael Golan writes I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony receivers, and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor s that hangs off the output to the speakers to speaker identical both models from amp idnetical both models Canadian model only US model and world wide model only Candian model only gound The board itself is also identical, with room for all three caps The US Can versions is clearly indicated in both places How does that make sense is , essentially for caps there are just standard caps, no special W type precision Please explain this Michael Golan The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series can handle twice the output voltage Sometimes two elco's in antiseries you know, positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well So there probably is no design philosophical reason, but a production cost one Best 's Wouter
