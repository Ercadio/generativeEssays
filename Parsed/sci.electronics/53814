From Wout Serdijn Subject Re how can uF be different from two in series In Michael Golan writes I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony receivers and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor s that hangs off the output to the speakers to speaker identical both models from amp idnetical both models Canadian model only US model and world wide model Candian model only gound The board itself is also identical with room for all three The US Can versions is clearly indicated in both How does that make sense is essentially for caps there are just standard caps no special W type precision Please explain this Michael Golan The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series can handle twice the output Sometimes two elco's in antiseries you know positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as So there probably is no design philosophical reason but a production cost Best 's Wouter
