From derry John Derry Subject Re Lead Acid batteries Concrete In article Carter Ames writes I was just wondering one thing actually I hope that this is the proper place to post this subject Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminals are I asked a friend and he said that you should never do that 'cause it ruins them but he couldn't tell me thanks What happens is that I heard this discussed on Northern Exposure there is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the molecules in the This acts as an attractant to UFOs actually their crew members and they arrive at the scene of the battery concrete Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES Remedy Set the battery on a nonconcrete Jack
