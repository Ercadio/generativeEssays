From Shishin Yamada Subject Re ATARI Processors In article Ian Farquhar writes In article Shishin Yamada writes The Atari used a CPU just like their entire bit line computers as well as the game machine Wrong it has a Sorry Ian I haven't toyed with it in several I haven't seen the insides in quite a few I just saw the post lagging for quite a few days and thought I'd toss in my I assume the was functionally similar to the was it also made by MOS Technologies I really am more versed in the based Atari The came later The had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the It had one custome chip not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood the TIA sometimes known as the although most other manufacturers list that as the CIA complex interface TIA stands for Television Interface Adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware the In the Atari computers the CIA chip you refer to sounds an awful lot like the CTIA Color Television Interface Adapter chip used in the early Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA Graphics Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood for George the developer of the There was also a standard RAM I O Timer RIOT plus a voltage regulator and if memory serves a That's Later model might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the Not according to the servicing documentation I have The did not change intenally very much at Funny I had an old and new The old one was SIGNIFICANTLY Additionally I think the used and up to of ROM for their ROMS were mapped into the upper of the 's address and games were fine but later and games needed bank Atari and others made much of these huge I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with but I would hazard a guess of or Sorry I am way out of line My first microcontroller I built was a based chipset with bytes That was not easy to work with in addtion to a small on board EPROM Wrong it had bytes of RAM from the This was multiply mapped into both page pseudo registers and page stack and also throughout the bottom of TIA registers also sat in this address As bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting some later cartridges also carried RAM themselves which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line to the This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address range and the writes into another but all the time this scheme ate into the very scarce ROM address
