From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died In article Brian Ceccarelli wrote Kent I am not accusing you of evil Jesus is accusing And it is not only you that He is He is accusing Me you and everyone in the world is Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil We do them Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you have to feel guilty and then there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt Brian I will tell you a secret I don't feel guilty at all I do mistakes and I regret them however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my If things happen wrong I will try to learn from the mistakes and go This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious And if your personality type is opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view So do you see Jesus's point Christians are not Nonchristians are not Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives and they will not like the It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus's Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know Do you think I want to know Ego verses the truth which do you choose All I know is that I don't know And frankly speaking I don't care life is fun I recognize that I'm not perfect but that does not hinder me from have a healthy and inspiring There are humans that subscribe to the same The nice thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden the shoulders feel far more relaxed Cheers Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the
