From Paul Harvey Subject Re Christians above the Law was Clarification of pe In article NUNNALLY John Nunnally writes When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question In paraphrase On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they are above the Law and above the Prophets major and minor and not accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion in Matthew What is the source of this pseudo doctrine Who is the pseudo teacher Who is the Great Deceiver OK here's at least one Christian's answer Jesus was a JEW not a In this context Matthew makes Matt Do not think that I Jesus came to abolish the Law or the Prophets I did not come to abolish but to Jesus lived under the Jewish However He was the culmination of the promises of the He came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey God's Verse says For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law until all is The key to this verse IMHO is the last Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the Law was supposed to Jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the Law and unless I'm mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed Am I mistaken And even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word of Jesus do you really think that all is accomplished Verse Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law this makes Then why didn't Jesus say Any Jew who annuls in Are you saying that all of Jesus' recorded words mean nothing to Gentiles Are you really saying that Jesus only spoke for and to the Jews Jesus didn't mention your name does that mean he wasn't speaking to you When you read the words of Jesus do you think he is speaking to someone other than you In general it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about doing away with the That was not Jesus' intent at You said above that Jesus was the fulfillment of the Are you saying that does not mean doing away with the Law He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve Gen The serpent will bruise your heel but He will bruise his JPS I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall strike at their NRSV I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his KJV And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his Looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the Word Jesus appeared to be doing away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only God's In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their Only helping the Jewish people In Galatians Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to the faith which was later to be Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by But now that faith has come we are no longer under a For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ I believe this says that after Christ was revealed the Law had served it's purpose our tutor to lead us to Christ and now we are no longer under a The law has been fulfilled as Christ said he would You are using your interpretation of Paul as an argument against the clear words of Jesus God the author of the old Law and the Christ Man Jesus are the same Therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last will and testament of Jesus are based on the same moral It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re expressed in Re expressed Care to define that a bit better On the other hand now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and What Are heaven and earth gone away Where did they go Is all accomplished for example Revelations Explain Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the mysteries of this new Baptism representing Christ's death burial and resurrection The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice I and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection Matt Acts Again your interpretation of Paul versus the clear word of Do you see any problems here When did heaven and earth go away When was all accomplished OK That's one Christian's I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other Please excuse the long Thanks for your interest if you have read this
