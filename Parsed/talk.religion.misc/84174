From Larry Margolis Subject Re Abortion In Anthony Landreneau writes To Larry Margolis From LM The rape has passed, there is nothing that will ever take that away LM LM LM True But forcing her to remain pregnant continues the violation of LM LM her body for another months I see this as being unbelievably cruel LM LM Life is not a violation LM But forcing someone to harbor that life in their body is a violation Letting a mother force a child from her body, in order to end that childs life is the ultimate violation I happen to take the violation of a person much more seriously than the violation of a mindless clump of cells smaller than my thumb Your mileage may vary Larry Margolis, MARGOLI YKTVMV Bitnet , margoli watson IBM com Internet
