From Stephen Andrew Weinstein Subject New Religion Forming Sign Up Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment Therefore even if this religion does not take off its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is For example Story of Adam and Eve Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and Have unlimited supply of food provided but no clothing jobs or God says not to eat fruit of tree of They do anyway then try to hide in God finds them and forces them out of There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered Traditional Philosophy The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to If someone else will provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's This is why married women usually didn't work until recent Authority figures such as God whoever was behind the Vietnam War Hitler and slaveowners are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people who can't make decisions for Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy They were not supposed to eat the They should have done whatever God told them Like small children they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their Father said Being forced to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food was a Lessons from Traditional Interpretation Ignorance is Knowledge is bad but Having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is Get ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is Public nudity is Covering up is Authority figures are intrinsically Normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without They should not think for People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from For example it should be illegal for slaves to learn to 's philosophy People should seek education and employment outside the home unless named Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown People should use common They should not kill other people binding of Issac wars Holocaust just because they are told Interpretation of events based on current philosophy They were supposed to eat the God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver Once they had gained knowledge and by seeking it showed their ability to make mature decisions for them selves they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were REWARDED by being allowed into the real Lessons from new interpretation Ignorance is Knowledge is good but must be Having food provided for you for nothing read welfare is at best a temporary Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is Public nudity is Covering up is Authority figures are often Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and alter or abolish bad They should think for People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway and all the For example poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children and themselves I have tentatively named this new philosophy The Church of Eveism because Eve's decision to eat the apple is man sic kind's first good decision instead of its first bad one as traditionally She is therefore clearly a God at first appears evil for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a As God rewarded the decision to defy him and provided the tree in the first place the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained but to delay it until it was actively End serious Begin Save this post to disk or file server Someday it will be considered the most important writing since the You want an original Stay tuned for the RFD on Can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization Return to serious discussion when posting follow Stephen Weinstein
