From dan a Rose arose Subject Re Christian Extremist Kills Doctor Adrienne Regard writes In article dan a Rose arose writes Seriously though Griffen didn't save the lives of children and he did destroy the life of a man so on the most superficial of levels he's I almost agree but Griffen is not Scum has no guilt or freedom to choose Griffen God did not make scum when he made He made a precious person and this person chose to do The same goes for But if you are to examine it more closely Griffen would have preferred that these children were born yet AFTER their birth did Griffen have any assistance to offer them Did Griffen intend to support them educate them raise them up to be useful citizens Did he have any intent whatsoever to help these children after birth Here's the real Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by This man has fled his responsibility has behaved like a lazy coward and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and However if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden she is not thought of in the same When the man abandons the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal When the woman abandons the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out and the man has no choice and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness the arrogance that says My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth And when you come down to it this is the substance of what hell is made It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven and we'll ruin it the first chance we Now I don't really know the answer to these questions but I've got a real good And it's probably And I wouldn't call that 'benevolent' It is a move in the right As it is now we don't see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of The media backs us Real responsibility does not The only responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that might show us our own true We want to feel like good people but we want nothing with being good Just give me the freedom to say I'm good and the rest of the world can Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they're I'll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or Screw the government because it screws me and don't talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing But I'm a good At least I admit what I At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world not that a man lay down his life for his sounds too christian At the root this is the substance of what hell is made We've become a self indulgant backslidden society no longer responsible to our children to our parents to our families to our government or to our This is the root behind justification of every evil of every corruption in government of every slanderous remark of every lie and of every Society cannot continue to live like this it will have to destroy itsself soon and perhaps in the end that will be the biggest blessing this world can hope to Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around I deplore the horrible crime of child We want prevention not merely We must reach the root of the It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful No mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the Susan Anthony The Revolution July
