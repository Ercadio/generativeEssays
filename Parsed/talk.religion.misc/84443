From David Matthew Deane Subject Re Flaming Nazis Okay I'll I should probably leave this alone but what the In article Gene Smith writes In article Pope Charles writes Rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and The name is Roehm not And Hitler does claim that he came up with the Swastika But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member some dentist or other I believe he gives such credit in Mein He was killed in an early Nazi He and many of his associates were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this common assertion Postings to such groups as and has not uncovered any who could provide Well I'm no expert but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common Also a book by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals as well as others in Roehm's SA All the books say that Roehm and his associate Edmund Heines were I have been able to find nothing beyond that and suspect this to be a sort of historical urban Well you're the one who is in If you don't believe the history books look up the primary sources Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to You It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances several scandals the fact that on the knight of the long knives several SA members including Heines were found sleeping together Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities seducing young boys etc The histories that I've read make a very convincing None of this sounds like urban legend to Irving a notoriously unreliable historian says that Funk the Nazi finance minister was He gives no I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about What precisely do you know that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti homosexual smear What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history Don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any I challenge anyone to document this If you are going to challenge all historians on this point not just Irving then the burden of proof is on Track down the Find out where the stories originate Again you are the one in Germany close to archival material most people on the net are I have found a great deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the This seems to include all of the worst ones Hitler Himmler Goebbels Goering Heydrich Eichmann and many Eh What is your agenda here To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals so that you can bash heterosexuals Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true Of course And what about bisexuals Are they half Nazis I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were The German officer corps before for instance was notorious for its There were numerous scandals which rocked the German during the late and early Many of the Kaiser's friends were prosecuted the Kaiser was no homosexual but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality going far back into Prussian history back to Frederick the Great at least who was himself a Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition and the old German army like the English public school system being a well known center of homosexuality would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's In addition some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre Nazi youth groups and some of the various pre war Vandervogel Bund and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship and in many cases homosexuality So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of Why should this suprise anyone Homosexuality has always existed in all societies it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an No I don't have any sources for you as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material and I do not have access to Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read I don't have the Nothing is stopping you however from chasing down those Until you prove otherwise though I will stick with the established David Matthew Deane in me as the eternal moods of the bleak the Gods speak softly of us in days Ezra Pound
