From stephen Subject Re Biblical Backing of Koresh's Tape Cites enclosed In article Peter Nelson In article writes In article writes In article stephen writes For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths Koresh was a nut okay Again I'd like to see some Nut or not he was clearly a He said he would surrender after local radio stations broadcast his message but he didn' Then he said he would surrender after Passover but he didn' The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast was for prime time and that Koresh never even heard it Wasn't even tuned in to the radio when it aired so no reason to come If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire transcript I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of evil As to coming out after Passover wasn't that just one of the lawyer's speculations Peter J stephen
