From Keith Allan Schneider Subject Re The Universe and Black Holes was Re salem Bruce Salem writes Is this Zeno's Paradox Zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite Nothing can get out of a black hole because the escape velocity is the speed of I don't know how time dialation can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event Can any one explain how matter gets Well suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black As it got closer to the event horizon the red shift would keep The period would get longer and longer but it would never An observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event The detected energy from the probe would keep decreasing but it wouldn't Exp t never quite reaches I guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear but hopefully you will get the general idea keith
