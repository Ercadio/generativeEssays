From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died In article Brian Kendig writes And I maintain Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own And so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs under a However some people but not many will not like the Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be These people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its And after a while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their Are you your own master Do you have any habits that you cannot break For one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Seems that ignorance has you How about sexual sins Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head Are you the master of that kind of thinking Do you insult people unknowingly then regret it Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself Are you truly the master of yourself I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all That I sometimes say things I do want to say and then repeat my mistake I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my There are times I know I shouldn't say something but then say it There are times I simply forget a I in fact am not my own I need Jesus promised me this And I took him up on his I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself And why not Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla Do you see my point I think you're the one under the rock and I'm getting a great tan out here in the My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism come and join me It will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but it's well worth it Then I guess ignorance is bliss for Because Brian you enjoy not having a clue about the Don't you see I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega powerful as what you're trying to get me to Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to don't you Can you witness motherly love with your senses How does caring and concern for you register with your senses If nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a Vulcan and You better get rid of your And I do have a good reason to believe what I When did I say that I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am then so be The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my God My God says that you will not CEASE You have life You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with That is what my God And that was the Your made up theism is what it is made It's wishful Nope most people are Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little You enjoy darkness and you're proud of Is this the religion of Kendigianism Most people are not Most people including Christians are not fond of feeling that they are Is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of Kendigianism It has nothing to do with my Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship Mine doesn' Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again Mine doesn' Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep Mine doesn' Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible Brian following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of You would find any of your doctrines in the I don't follow I follow Also to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to priests have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews and Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today Yes guess what The Catholics messed I do not follow Catholicism or any I follow You make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you If you are content with the life you've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then you've led a good Why would you want to live a good life To you you die and that's Don't contradict You have no reason to live a good It doesn't do you any good in the Your life doesn't do anybody else any good either because everyone dies So you have no reason to lead a good Leading a good life is Why do you do such a meaningless thing I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it's not really all that Has the resurrection sunk in Jesus is Jesus is NOT Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every Jesus's death was like a He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take Did you miss the entire John passage as well Forget the Bible for a Forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or Show Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're Forget that I am a Forget that I know how to Forget that I know how to put a
