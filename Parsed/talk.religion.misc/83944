From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Brian Ceccarelli wrote that's me Kent I am not accusing you of evil Jesus is accusing And it is not only you that He is He is accusing Me you and everyone in the world is Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil We do them Kent Sandvik responds Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you have to feel guilty I think I see where you are coming from Jesus doesn't view guilt like our modern venacular colors Feelings have nothing to do with Feelings arise from the state of being Feeling and guilt are mutally Feelings are a reaction from Jesus is talking about the guilt state not the Let me give you an example Have you ever made a mistake Have you ever lied to someone Even a little white lie Have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know Have you ever hated someone Have you ever been selfish Are you guilty of any one of these The answer is of course You are That is it what Jesus is getting No big Feelings do not even enter the Consider Jesus's use of the word guilt as how a court uses Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being The Bible calls it the state that we are all We all do bad Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all It is it in our nature to do bad We are sinners therefore we do bad Being a sinner is It is not a pleasant But it is just a We are not Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human Guilty as and then there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt You can handle your guilt in one of two ways Acknowledge you made a mistake learn from it and try to not do it again in the meantime not punishing yourself for it which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or This is the healthy Or two the destructive way put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys even to This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with All people fall into this category to some extent in their Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our Jesus knows we are That isn't new to It is no big deal to He just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and That is what he wants you to Why because he wants to have your You are immensely valuable to Jesus wants a relationship with you however in our present sinful nature we are incapable of having this God is We are You cannot fit a square peg into a round However God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with God has provided Jesus so that whosoever just believes in Jesus will have their nature The Holy Spirit will move And now divine nature is now within lives our very being and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy The benefits of this are For with the divine nature living within us we can now see our imperfections We can now head them off at the With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us we now have his power to help us overcome our Because the divine nature lives within us we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could Because the divine nature now lives within us we now have authority over demonic And lastly because the divine nature now lives within us we have eternal life for the Holy Spirit is The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom it is your relationship to the living Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep Many people in the last day will ask him Didn't I prophesy in your name and do miracles and do good things in your name And what did Jesus say Depart from me for I never knew That is the cornerstone of Christianity Jesus must know you as his It is your relationship to If he is your friend and you are his you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in Brian I will tell you a secret I don't feel guilty at all I do mistakes and I regret them however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my It shows that you have a strong self image that you love That is the second greatest commandment Jesus If only more people could do as you As I said before in the common english venacular feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious And if your personality type is opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego a lot less self centeredness and a lot more unconditional There are humans that subscribe to the same The nice thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden the shoulders feel far more relaxed You have stated what Jesus Remember Come to me take my yoke upon your shoulders for my burden is A yoke is used to direct oxen to do Once you have a relationship with Jesus you and him share the yoke and the burdens of Having God at your side is of
