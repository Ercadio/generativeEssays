From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Apr God's Promise in John In article Brian Kendig writes I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to I really wish I could believe in him 'cos no matter how much confidence I build up on my own the universe is a big place and it would be so nice to know I have someone watching over me in Brian I am pleased with your And to be honest as well I believe you have not asked my god to come to Why do I say this Because by the things you write on the net and the manner with which you write them you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real I got news for Yours doesn't at all sound like Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't I've gone into this with an open I've layed my beliefs aside from time to time when I've had doubt and I've prayed to see what good that would I don't see what more I can do to open myself to your god short of just deciding to believe for no good And if I decide to believe for no good reason why not believe in some other god Zeus seems like a pretty cool I am sorry Brian but when I read your postings I do not see an open What I do see is misunderstanding lack of knowledge arrogance and Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to Be true to yourself Have an open And so end the Gain knowledge of the real Put your presumptions Read the Bible and know that there is truly is a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly A person who commits himself to seeking God will find Jesus stands at your door and But a person who half heartedly opens the Bible or opens it with purpose to find something to mock will find learn and see The only thing one will gain with that attitude is Be careful to not jump the gun for at first glance there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and Be assured that even though they seem alien at first be confident that they are Be assured that beyond your present comprehension there lies such deep reasons that once you see them you will indeed be I will personally guarantee that As Jesus put it You will never be thirsty Your cup will even flow From King Solomon to It is the glory of God to conceal a matter to search out a matter is the glory of Jesus says in John No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws And in John For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal You are included in whosoever And I also pray that the Father is drawing you which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to Remember Brian you could be a Paul in the Paul not only mocked Christians as you do but also had pleasure stoning Yet God showed him mercy saved him and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's You see Brian I myself better be careful and not judge you because you could indeed be the next For with the fervor that you attack Christians one day you might find yourself one and like Paul proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or Or you could be the next What Jesus said to Peter Jesus would probably say to you Satan would surely like to have Why so Because Peter was hard headed cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus You asked Why not believe in Zeus Zeus didn't offer eternal You got nothing to gain by believing in Brian Ceccarelli
