From Mark Fuller Subject Re rw is Robert Weiss the only Orthodox Christian In article LIBRBA writes Robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying things like it is held Kermit thread On what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox Who is that holds that Luke meant what you said he meant Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to look at the Bible in order to see the truth but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it Rick I think we can safely say Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible and the leadership of the LDS church historicly never Let's consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism which could never be confused with Orthodox In one of his attacks on Christians the Mormon Apostle Bruce McConkie said they thrash around in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised He also said Christians are wrong to believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity God the Father and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the He said that Elohim is the Father and Jehovah is the Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three in one God it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only As with their concept that God is a Spirit this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven is The fact is and it too is attested by Holy Writ that Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the Son who was born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ the promised Promised Messiah Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their three in one God and their belief that God is a Spirit as they are in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah Before examining McConkie's attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words Elohim and McConkie stated chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in the Old Testament as that ancient work is now published is the exalted name title Promised Messiah Elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Mormon Doctrine Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and Jehovah are the Apostle James Talmage stated Elohim as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus Christ is the name title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is Jehovah the Only Begotten in the flesh Jesus Jesus the Christ A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve apostles of the Mormon Church states that God the Eternal is designate d by the exalted name title 'Elohim' Articles of Faith in His preexistent antemortal or unembodied known as Articles of Faith Today Mormon leaders teach that Elohim in the OT refers to God the Father and Jehovah refers to McConkie attacked Christians for saying Jehovah can refer to the He stressed that these two name titles should not be changed around so that Christ is called Elohim and the Father is called Elohim not Jehovah is Christ and Christ is Jehovah they are one and the same Promised Messiah In the OT of the KJV of the Bible the Hebrew word Elohim is used to refer to the true God false gods and goddesses and the judges of When referring to the true God Elohim is translated with a capital When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel it is translated with a small It is translated four times as judges once as judge twice as mighty once as angels once as godly once as great and once as very The word Jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or However since Jehovah rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism this section will also use Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that Jehovah unlike Elohim is never used of false It is the personal name of the triune God of the In the KJV Jehovah is rendered primarily LORD sometimes GOD and rarely Now that we understand something about the words Elohim and Jehovah and their use by Mormon leaders we shall consider the Apostle McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is In trying to prove that Jehovah refers exclusively to Christ McConkie cited several verses from the Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was Remember McConkie said the Father is not Jehovah He is only The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Of this verse he stated Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit and he testified The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Two Lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the Who are they and what message is contained in this Messianic prophecy What think ye of Christ our Lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal Whose son is he Is Christ the Son of God or of someone else Is he to be born of a divine Parent or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father That he was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the And so they answered The Son of David's son Truly he But he was more much And so our Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked How then doth David in spirit call him Lord saying The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool If David then call him Lord how is he his son That is if he is only the Son of David how is it that the great King acting under inspiration calls him Lord and worships him as such And we might add Who is the other Lord the one who spake unto David's Lord Can there be any question as to how Jesus is interpreting the words of the Psalm He is saying that it means ' The Father said unto the Son Elohim said unto Jehovah sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand ' Promised Messiah emphasis added Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet What the Mormons Think of Christ reads The Lord Elohim the Father said unto my Lord Jehovah the Son brackets in original McConkie clearly stated that it is Elohim the Father who is speaking to Jehovah the Son in this However when one looks at the Hebrew word translated LORD it becomes apparent that either the first LORD is not the Father or else the Father is Either way McConkie is The Psalm reads The LORD Jehovah said unto my Lord Adon Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy The first LORD in this verse is Jehovah who Mormonism says is Christ not the The second Lord is the Hebrew word Adon singular for Adonai meaning master or lord If the first LORD is the Father and the second Lord is the Son then the Father is Jehovah and the Son is However if the Father is not Jehovah as McConkie claimed then the first LORD is Jehovah the Son but who then is Adon Obviously the Father is Jehovah in this Psalm and His Son is Another example involves about which McConkie stated the following I the Lord have called thee in righteousness Isaiah quoted the Father as saying of Christ and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Promised Messiah emphasis added McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads I the LORD Jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the According to McConkie I the LORD refers to the Father and thine and thee refer to However the LORD who is speaking is Jehovah which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is Another example involves Of these verses McConkie stated The same Psalm says All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in The fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross is found in these words The chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said He saved others himself he cannot If he be the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe He trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the Son of The thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his Promised Messiah emphasis added reads as follows All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the LORD Jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment as Jesus hung on the That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Who then was the LORD in whom he trusted It was Jehovah the Another example involves and Regarding them McConkie stated the following With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was They took counsel together against me they devised to take away my As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies the Psalmist says Mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against Promised Messiah Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's arrest and judicial We shall first consider and then While McConkie only quoted verse of verse will also be included to give a complete understanding of the For I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my But I trusted in thee O LORD Jehovah I said Thou art my God Elohim McConkie said verse referred to Jesus Verse goes on to tell that He Christ trusted in the LORD who is called His God or Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is Elohim the Verse however reveals that the Elohim of the man Jesus is Jehovah the In McConkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against But thou O LORD Jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite McConkie stated above that verse referred to Judas' role in Christ's Since it was Judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel the pronouns mine I my and me in verse must refer to Notice that at the beginning of verse there is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the LORD Jehovah Then the pronouns me and I which refer to Christ are used That means Christ was speaking to Jehovah the Father in these Another example involves McConkie's following remark about One of the great Messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of David says The Lord hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Promised Messiah McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving The question is What in this verse refers to Christ The LORD Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Does the LORD which is Jehovah refer to Christ If McConkie is right and Jesus is Jehovah but the Father is not then the LORD would have to refer to But who then is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ therefore the LORD Jehovah in is the Another example involves Of these verses McConkie stated Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah The Lord has laid on him the iniquities of us It pleased the Lord to bruise Promised Messiah emphasis added McConkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future However what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is Verse reads All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD Jehovah hath laid on him Christ the iniquity of us all and verse reads Yet it pleased the LORD Jehovah to bruise him Christ Obviously the LORD who laid on Christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called Jehovah in these Remember McConkie stated that some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten He called this concept misinformation that is To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two Scriptural references will be McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic the Lord says of the Seed of David I will be his father and he shall be my In the second Psalm the whole of which is also clearly Messianic occurs this statement Thou art my Son this day have I begotten Paul quotes both of these statements in Hebrews and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the Son of Promised Messiah McConkie cited to show that and refer to Christ who would come as the Son of Since McConkie first referenced this examination will However along with verse verses will also be And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine Also the LORD Jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his He shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for I will be his father and he shall be my These verses teach that the LORD Jehovah would have a Son the In the second example McConkie cited This examination will include verse Notice that it is the LORD Jehovah who says Thou art my Son this day have I begotten I will declare the decree the LORD Jehovah hath said unto me Thou art my Son this day have I begotten Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy McConkie said these verses of Scripture are clearly Messianic and he acknowledged they teach that Christ would come as the Son of What he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is Jehovah and that the sectarians who believe Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son is Jesus Christ the Only Begotten are right in their Another example involves Of this verse McConkie stated the following And so truly did our Lord act during his mortal ministry Truly this is he of whom it is written He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his for now shall he be great unto the ends of the Promised Messiah emphasis added According to McConkie the pronoun He at the beginning of refers to Christ during his mortal Who then is the LORD his God reads And he Christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD Jehovah in the majesty of the name of the LORD Jehovah his God Elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the Obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Father who is referred to as Jehovah his Another example involves and Of these verses McConkie stated the following A number of Messianic passages speak of the Lord anointed signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was Jesus applied these passages to himself by quoting Isaiah's The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek and then saying This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Luke Promised Messiah emphasis added The first source McConkie quoted reads as follows The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD Jehovah and against his McConkie said the anointed one was If that is true who was Jehovah If Jehovah is always Christ who was the anointed one Obviously Jehovah is referring to God the Father and the anointed is indeed referring to The second source McConkie cited is which states The Spirit of the Lord Adonai GOD Jehovah is upon me because the LORD Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound The one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was Jesus Who then was the one who anointed Him This verse says the LORD Jehovah did the Again we face the same If Jehovah does not refer to the Father but only to Christ then Jesus anointed someone but who As McConkie pointed out Jesus applied these passages to Therefore the Jehovah who anointed Christ is God the Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not However these should be enough to expose their Now what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is Jehovah but He is not Elohim It is true that Jesus is The following Scriptures prove this fact Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no Jesus said am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was the LORD Jehovah shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only Behold he Christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of denied the Holy One Christ and the Acts And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD Jehovah shall be Joel name of Jesus Christ of is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be Acts Behold the Lord GOD Jehovah will come with strong reward is with I Christ come quickly and my reward is with LORD Jehovah my God shall come and all the saints with the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his The LORD Jehovah is my Jesus said I am the good John the Lord GOD Jehovah I will seek that which was Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was Luke For I am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus See also and and and John and and and While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah they are wrong when they say He is not The Bible reveals that Jehovah is the only true Elohim there is all others are Remember Jehovah is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as Jehovah and Elohim but so is the Holy Whereof the Holy Ghost said is the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them And their sins and iniquities will I remember no emphasis on Holy Ghost and said added Behold the days come saith the LORD Jehovah that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God Elohim and they shall be my I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no emphasis added For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost emphasis on Holy Ghost added The Spirit of the LORD Jehovah spake by me and his word was in my See also with Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons And when the LORD Jehovah saw that he Moses turned aside to see God Elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses And he said Here am Bruce McConkie acknowledged that it was Christ's voice that spoke to Moses in the burning Promised Messiah And the LORD Jehovah And Moses said unto God Elohim Behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them The God Elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me What is his name what shall I say unto them And God Elohim said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto And God Elohim said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of your fathers the God Elohim of Abraham the God Elohim of Isaac and the God Elohim of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all And God Elohim spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the LORD Jehovah I am the LORD Jehovah and there is none else there is no God Elohim beside me I girded thee though thou hast not known me But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God Elohim and an everlasting Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God Elohim Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus saith the LORD Jehovah whose name is The God Elohim of Amos Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's Jehovah's thy God Elohim the earth also with all that therein Wherefore thou art great O LORD Jehovah God Elohim for there is none like thee neither is there any God Elohim beside thee according to all that we have heard with our And he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry For who is God Elohim save the LORD Jehovah or who is a rock save our God Elohim Blessed is the nation whose God Elohim is the LORD Jehovah See also Hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting God Elohim the LORD Jehovah the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his The mighty God Elohim even the LORD Jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down Sing unto God Elohim sing praises to his name estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH and rejoice before Regarding the word Jah Bruce McConkie stated Jah Hebrew Yah is a contracted form of Jehovah Jahveh or Yahweh all of which names have reference to Christ the God of Mormon Doctrine And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God Elohim whose name is called by the name of the LORD Jehovah of hosts that dwelleth between the Great the Mighty God Elohim the LORD Jehovah of hosts is his O my God Elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name O LORD Jehovah That men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH art the most high over all the The Bible clearly teaches that Jehovah is In fact He is the only Elohim there He is the true the living the mighty the great and the everlasting He is the Elohim of Israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell Jehovah's name is Elohim of Amos Not only is Jehovah Elohim but Elohim is The Bible reveals that Elohim's name is Jah Jehovah and Jehovah of The nation whose Elohim is Jehovah is Clearly this is not the Jehovah and Elohim of the Another Mormon error regarding Elohim and Jehovah is the belief that Elohim not Jehovah is the Father of all the spirits including In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James Talmage A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve apostles states that God the Eternal 'Elohim ' is the literal Parent spirits of the human This Doctrinal Exposition also states explicitly that Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for He is one of He is The Son as they are sons and daughters of The Apostle Talmage stated that Elohim the name title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is Jehovah Jesus the Christ The Apostle Bruce McConkie stated the following about this matter in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face But when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in Creators That is the Father himself became personally All things were created by the Son using the power delegated by the Father except In the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the Father There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was Promised Messiah emphasis added Mormon leaders claim that Jehovah Christ did not create either man's spirit or his They maintain that the Mormon Elohim who is the father created man both in spirit and The Bible reveals the truth about who created And Moses spake unto the LORD Jehovah saying Let the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the See also emphasis added LORD Jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him emphasis added LORD Jehovah us this For I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which I have made the LORD Jehovah emphasis on have made added Behold I am the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of all flesh emphasis added Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all emphasis added Thus saith the LORD Jehovah I have made the earth and created man upon emphasis added Elohim created man upon the Unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD Jehovah he is God Elohim there is none else beside Thus saith God El the LORD Jehovah that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk saith the LORD Jehovah of hosts the God Elohim of I have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the most emphasis added The Bible reveals that it is Jehovah who is the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was He who formed the spirit of man within him that He made us this soul and formed us from the He did indeed create If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah then they are wrong when they say he did not create If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man Mormon scriptures teach that he The BoM states the following Behold I am Jesus I am the Father and the And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created for never has man believed in me as thou Behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and man have I created after the body of my emphasis added For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is I that hath created them emphasis added God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of that same God who created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them Behold he created Adam emphasis added D C states that the worlds were made by him Christ men were made by him all things were made by him and through him and of emphasis added Another error by Bruce McConkie involving Jehovah and his creation is the belief that Jehovah had many pre mortal spirits helping him Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith That he Christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit children of the Father is evident from Abraham's Unto those superior spirits Christ said We will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may Michael or Adam was one of Enoch Noah Abraham Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other noble and great ones played a part in the great creative Doctrines of Salvation Mormon Doctrine The Bible reveals the truth about this matter Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by Which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the Job Jehovah by Himself created all He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim the Apostle McConkie stated plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Mormon Doctrine He also stated that above all save the Father Promised Messiah The Bible states that the One who is God above all so called gods is the triune God For the LORD Jehovah is a great God El and a great King above all gods Elohim For thou LORD Jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods Elohim Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods Elohim See also If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jehovah is god the son and Elohim is god the father these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his However as McConkie clearly stated Mormons believe Elohim the father not Jehovah the son is the God above all Gods that Jesus is above all except the father yet the Bible teaches that Jehovah is above all At a BYU on March Bruce McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been This is plain sectarian Our prayers are addressed to the Father and to him prayer is addressed to the Father in the name of the Son it is uttered by the power of the Holy Our Relationship With the Lord McConkie states on of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons pray to the Father not the On of the same book McConkie states that Christ the Son is This is important to remember because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is Jehovah the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to Jehovah and He not only heard those prayers but He accepted them as valid The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to In my distress I called upon the LORD Jehovah and cried unto my God Elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his And the LORD Jehovah said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there And said unto Jeremiah the prophet Let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the LORD Jehovah thy God Elohim even for all this O LORD Jehovah I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy And it was so that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD Jehovah he arose from before the altar of the LORD Jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to He went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the LORD Jehovah Go and say to Hezekiah Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto thy days fifteen I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not I said I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD Jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be Notice above in that the godly pray to According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not The Bible reveals there is only one true Elohim and His name is All other Elohim are They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true Elohim and For the LORD Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods Elohim For all the gods Elohim of the nations are idols but the LORD Jehovah made the Thou shalt have no other gods Elohim before Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods Elohim And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD Jehovah thy God Elohim and walk after other gods Elohim and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods Elohim They shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods Elohim it will surely be a snare unto Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods Elohim and worship That ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods Elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto walk after other gods Elohim to your But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God Elohim And they forsook the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods Elohim of the gods Elohim of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD Jehovah to Shall a man make gods Elohim unto himself and they are no gods Elohim Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know I will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the LORD Jehovah And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD Jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods Elohim which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods Elohim of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the LORD Jehovah And the people answered and said God Elohim forbid that we should forsake the LORD Jehovah to serve other gods Elohim These verses teach that the only true living Elohim in heaven and on earth is Jehovah the triune God who made heaven and earth and all Jehovah is greater than any Elohim because all other Elohim are The reality behind them is Jehovah Elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false He told His people not to have any Elohim but He told the people that if they left Him for the false Elohim those Elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would He warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false Jehovah Elohim told His people He would eventually judge all false Elohim and their Despite these warnings and guidelines Elohim's covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false Elohim's of the people they came in contact states that the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD Jehovah and served Baalim and Ashtaroth and the gods Elohim of Syria and the gods Elohim of Zidon and the gods Elohim of Moab and the gods Elohim of the children of Ammon and the gods Elohim of the Philistines and forsook the LORD Jehovah and served not This examination has shown that the Elohim of Mormonism like the Elohim in is not the true Jehovah Therefore the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do the sight of the LORD Jehovah Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father Jehovah sent His Son into the world these beliefs are God is triune He is Spirit He is Jehovah and He did send His Son into the world to redeem It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who thrash around about who Elohim and Jehovah One wonders what Holy Writ McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are all the one Jehovah He apparently did not mean the D C either because chapter verses refer to the Father as Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God Doctrines of Salvation is not The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and In answer to Jesus' question But whom say ye that I am Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles Therefore anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in another Jesus whom Paul warned Bernard Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy admitted in the May issue of The Ensign a Mormon publication that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian He stated that it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and They do not have the Son therefore they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal As the Apostle Bruce McConkie rightly stated Salvation comes only by worshiping the true Promised Messiah McConkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God because the true names of Deity can be applied to false concepts of Mormon Doctrine Remember that the Apostle Stephen Richards admitted that Joseph Smith gave a new
