From Bob Sarver Subject Re DID HE REALLY RISE emery The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the world over the centuries is the resurrection of This is hardly possible as the majority of people in the world were born lived their life and died without ever knowing anything about The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he is not who Emery thinks he emery Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that Jesus really did rise from the dead We have four gospel I am leaving out all proofs of Emery's which rely on quoting the bible as Circular reasoning There have been occasions already stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change edit or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it is true then to be fair we have to do the same to the Bhagavad Gita and the Koran both of which contradict the Enough emery Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that these people were not God fearing people who sincerely and whole heartedly believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real And for what gain would they lie To make a stand at that time meant persecution imprisonment and perhaps even Again this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof of any of this It just isn't Besides simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not make your faith There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is the correct religion emery History bears out the persecution of Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus Govenor of Asia in writing of Nero's reign alluded to the torture of Christians in Rome All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their That does not prove that their faith is true or correct it just means that they were sincere in their Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the It's not that And minority religions have always suffered torture Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia All religions are harassed in China You haven't proven anything so emery With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer it would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big Not if they didn't believe that it was a emery Yet not one It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen from the dead especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those who The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koran says Muhammad They were attacked and slaughtered for their They didn't denounce Muhammad or If you are correct then that means Islam is the true You see how stupid your proofs are
