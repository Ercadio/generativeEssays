From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Jesus This is the verdict Light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds are Everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be Kent Sandvik says It seems we are dealing with a black and white Brian are you subtly accusing me of evil things because I never saw the light However this is even more confusing because I even admit that I don't like the situation where I'm not Black and A spade is a There is no hidden agenda behind this so stop trying to look for It is an easy and as straight forward as it Kent I am not accusing you of evil Jesus is accusing And it is not only you that He is He is accusing Me you and everyone in the world is Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil We do them Jesus uses the word men I am Jesus is not soloing you Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of Christians are not immuned from doing evil A Christian is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit A Christian can see the evil he is doing because his evil has been brought out into the Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed that the Christian will stop doing If you haven't seen Jesus's light your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the His You may shed some light on your Your human spirit shines at perhaps But the Holy Spirit shines at a The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know So do you see Jesus's point Christians are not Nonchristians are not Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives and they will not like the It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus's Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know Do you think I want to know Ego verses the truth which do you choose I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light and made sure that the children burned to death as part of his insight into the I don't think the world is that And if you act in such ways when you are enlighted then I'm a happy man and I pray I will never receive such 'light' And I watched Koresh too an imposter who thought he saw the light who made sure that the children burned to death sadly as part of his It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them and that ignorance was their downfall to And Kent don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh as if Koresh actually had truth in David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus David Koresh who claimed to be Jesus was a It was David Koresh was born in Jesus was born in Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as Jesus warned of such imposters in the end David Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus told us to be aware of imposters years So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Ask the Where were you born Was your mother's name Mary If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the The wouldn't have followed They wouldn't have But look what Their ignorance cost them their Their choice to be ignorant cost them a Kent since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve Did he not misquote God What Satan used on Eve and succeeded was the same ploy he tried on But in Jesus's case Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible in It didn't work with Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers Who did Koresh emulate Who was Koresh's teacher Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Did not Koresh kill his followersr Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death God held them all responsible deceiver and the None of them had an As opposed to the Branch Davidians we have a second Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal Don't follow Jesus and you stand condemned already for like the Branch Davidian complex your house is already on Satan Adam and Eve have already set it It is just a slow burn but it is burning
