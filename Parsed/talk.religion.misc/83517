From Tony Alicea Subject Re Rosicrucian Order s Kent With all due respect how can I take you seriously when you have the NAMES wrong in the place The San Jose RC Ordo Rosae Crucis There is no such The correct name is Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis abbreviated the Rocicrusian order created by Max There is no such thing It's the Rosicrucian And they clearly state that they DO NOT pretend to descend from the Order of the Fama In addition there are many splinter groups all around Europe that all claim some connection with the original group supposedly founded in the middle The Lectorium And who else Some Freemason groups also have Rosicrucian like separate groups even if they are far from the ideologies the RC groups have somehow in These are NOT Rosicrucian orders They are Masonic study groups none of which claims to be descendant of the original We might compete about how much time we have spent with this Let me start I was part of the ORC for about Kent What is ORC If you mean AMORC you didn't even learn the correct name Tony
