From ChaOs Subject Re under Literary Critical Analysis In article Dennis Kriz writes Hi all I'm going to try to do something here that perhaps many would not have thought even I want to begin the process of initiating a literary critical study of the pornography posted on to identify the major themes and motifs present in the stories posted there opening up then the possibility of an objective moral evaluation of the material present First off let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about You sick perverts you are immoral you are all going to which seems to be the usual religious post found on the Hopefully you won't get flamed You will however be argued I personally think that your project is built on unsteady First I do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality Morality and value are inherently subjective they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of They can be widely held perhaps even overwhelmingly held but they are never and can never be Assumptions A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True comes Truly from Regarding While perhaps even from an objective standpoint the majority of its material is indeed repugnant you come to this conclusion quite quickly when you start thinking about analyzing its material like this some of it reflects some fairly profound needs in people as well as some truths and deserve to be pointed Second I do not accept the assumptions that you make If as you say you are trying to be objective then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible You're defeating your own purpose by doing In the long run the advantage of making such a literary moral analysis is that it will save band width between Christians and non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of the stuff on these pornographic Third call me a pessimist but you won't stop the There will always be people who pop upin to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all Just out of curiosity do readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow minded censoring overbearing totalitarianists Basically there should not be a dissonance between a Christian morality and a non Christian Either there is value in a particular work or there is not whether one is a Christian or Let me provide an Four people get together over dinner to discuss morality you me a rather conservative Moslem and a I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with You agree but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own Just a note I really don't know your views on homosexuality I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces The sociopath who has become bored kills all three of us and eats us but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own In support for the first assumption The Christian scriptures say this Evidence deleted I'm not going to accept your evidence for You ask us to accept The Word of God that everything good comes from This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your Still I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours so good luck with this next NOW THEN what are some of the major themes motifs in the pornographic literature on places like These are some that I've been able to Please add comment on Motif THE MALE In so many of the stories there is expressed a feeling of alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the other person of his her Often a story involves a protagonist who on the surface is quite average but underneath usually has an enormous dick who desires to in some way to gain access in a definitely sexual way to the other person who he she confesses is far more desireable than he she is and who indeed seems to walk between the rain I detect just a wee bit of condescence here Motif A CELEBRATION OF INDEED PREOCCUPATION WITH not very The vast majority of pornographic literature deals with beauty be it innocence somehow about to be lost grace or simply physical And generally most people Christian or non will say that beauty is One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better or more good than non beautiful I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily Motif ONE'S DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF Might I suggest the word penis It seems more in line with the tone of your Blessed are those who are well hung for they shall get from what would thus be a revised Matthew Bravo I respect you and your sense of humor Motif SEX AS AN EXPRESSION OF SINCERE There is often enough a clear desire on the part of the protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object person of his her Yes and this theme is usually what the better stories are However they are not always selfish I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg for Motif DESCRIBES A SEX WHICH IS COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE REALM OF TRANSMITTING LIFE So removed is sex from its procreative dimension on that one begins to wonder why sex even involves ejaculation as in the context described in pornography it serves then no real It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies it affirms the virility of the male involved as well as assuring the reader that he the character has The Whole Picture TM is probably very well described by the Catholic teaching on this Of the husband and wife in an act of total mutual self giving in the sexual union cooperating with God in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life Humane Vitae Your Whole Picture TM unfortunately only applies to people who accept your In addition if sex is for procreation then Why did God make it pleasurable so that people would want to do it rather than building it in as instinct Why did God make it fallible Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy even among Does this mean that they have sinned In any case and the Catholic teaching will probably not see eye to eye on this for a long Motif SEX USED AS AN INSTRUMENT VIOLENCE POWER AND Why pornography seems to tend in that direction I really do not Probably volumes could be written on the relationships between sex and power But this probably gives good reason why traditionally Judeo Christianity has been so negative with regard to sexuality it seems to tend to a great moral Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life but will think about and read about
