From Bob Sarver Subject Re JUDAS CRUCIFIXION TYRE Frank DeCenso I need to prioritize things in my life and this board is not all that important to Of course it It forms a very big part of your self You come onto the board thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith and you routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded Frank DeCenso This board will have to wait until if ever I can organize my life to fit it I tried dropping out but Sieferman coerced me to come He won't this I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping It's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to play in this game because you insist on playing from a losing hand and you're finally realizing You will lurk on the board and keep quiet for a while looking for an area where you are certain that you are correct and then we'll see you pop back in Of course you then will say that you have merely returned because your life is now in order But we'll know
