From Peter Nyikos Subject Re Spreading Christianity Re Christian Extremist Kills Doctor Most of the key issues in the line post to which I am following up are dealt with in the following post I made on yesterday modified to correct the next to last Message ID References In writes In article Peter Nyikos writes In John Bates writes In article Peter Nyikos writes perhaps out of dedication to your I never never thought that you would be consciously intellectually dishonest I am Can you show me anything that would lead you to think otherwise See the Spreading Christianity thread in which he says I ignore certain statements that I specifically acknowledged and Dean did He called them the Great Commission but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Jerusalem Bible translation And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have to say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust from your I tell you solemnly on the day of Judgment it will not go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with that In the post to which Dean is referring above I said The above is a good description of Kaflowitz who keeps harping on shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said The highlighted words refer to Matt and And Dean countered Actually this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the In fact it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing and not just the one and for you to characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you Of course Matt quoted above makes no mention of instruction to spread the All these quotes btw are from Message ID in which at the end he claims I did not answer a question which I answered and which he deleted to get the chronology right he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer And I claim it correctly because my question went Do you too measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood and the closest Dean came to an answer was Peter Peter You're just so stupid pretentious dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there Of course this does NOT answer my question which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in Surely even Dean knows this yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult So I now restore the answer to your question that you If you're still unable to figure it out ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help It really doesn't take much sophistication to On top of which I doubt that the answer is at all representative of Dean's true frame of The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's mind throughout the line post from which these quotes were One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of the sins of other I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's That I made public announcements of the sins of others sins BTW that were a matter of public record documented in the posts of others is a different Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins so I pointed some of them And I expressly set up a whole thread YOUR TURN to let people point out MY sins to Dean again You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saints thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I Actually what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish In doing so he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of I went very easily on Dean for this giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints suggesting that he had been merely careless in his In an astonishing act of ingratitude Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us and using it as the basis of one insult after Peter Nyikos
