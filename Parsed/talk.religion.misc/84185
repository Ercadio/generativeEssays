From Jim Halat Subject The fact of the theory In article C Andy Peters writes Andy I think we do agree given your clarification of how we were each using the terms fact and I'll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them though your usage is quite Note that the fact of evolution is still a In other words it could theoretically still be falsified and But since it's so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems pointless to explicitly try to falsify it I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can Not to be a pain in the ass but is there any reason you don't just say the theory of evolution rather than the fact of evolution is still a theory I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to the fact of evolution basically leaving off the phrase is still a theory Without a clarification like the one you just gave just saying the fact of evolution has a very different meaning to description of atomic theory and alternative theories of gravity deleted Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about Here is where you fail to make an important You have shoehorned the facts of the existence of gravity and atoms and evolution into one category with the theories which have been proposed to explain the mechanisms The existence of these things is so predictive as to be considered The mechanisms on the other hand are still worth I'm not sure I agree Again it may be because I feel stronger about separating I was trying to say that the theories proposed to explain the mechanisms and the mechanisms themselves are the only realities It is the existence of mechanisms not the things themselves that are so predictive as to be considered fact as you would say There aren't really little planetary particle systems called atoms out Or I should say and more to my original point it would be a leap of faith to say there are because we observe only the There is no need to believe there are actually atoms out there as we have decided to think about It's enough to discuss the At any rate I'm not sure I am being any clearer than before but I thought it was worth a The bottom line though is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence my way the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence your way creation is just an If a theist wants to call it a theory then he I won't it has no supporting evidence and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can be With no mechanisms to talk about there really isn't much to Do you agree jim halat bear stearns whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you nyc i speak only for myself
