From Brian Kendig Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Brian Ceccarelli writes They do not want to know it or be exposed to light because their own evil deeds will be And so by their own choice they will remain in Sort of like bugs under a However some people but not many will not like the Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be These people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its And after a while by virtue of the light they will see the depths of their own shortcomings AND how to correct And also they will see that there is much much more to this world than just the narrow little experiences under the They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yukky and that life with the Light of the World is So great that they will want to tell all their friends about And I maintain Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own And so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs under a However some people but not many will not like the Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be These people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its And after a while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky and that life on their own terms is great so great that they will want to tell everyone else about Do you see my point I think you're the one under the rock and I'm getting a great tan out here in the My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism come and join me It will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but it's well worth it Not all people hate light We all have an adversion to it to some But Brian Kendig who has been replying to this thread certainly likes Brian enjoys stating false concepts and false pressumptions about the God of the Without checking his own presumptions he compares my God with Odin or Look you just practically equated Odin and Zeus They're as much different as your god is from Don't you see I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega powerful as what you're trying to get me to Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to don't you Withough checking his own presumption he thinks hell is the equivalent of non When did I say that I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am then so be Do you enjoy darkness Most people will honestly admit yes Most people are fond of their sexual sins their hording of money their selfishness and not to mention their Biblical Nope most people are Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little You enjoy darkness and you're proud of You may know the Bible well but have you read any of the Koran Or Zen writings Or Hare Krishna literature If you haven't then how can you say you have an open mind Sin is fun Let's admit But a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this life and hell in the You make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you If you are content with the life you've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then you've led a good Come out from under the Please For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it's not really all that Forget the Bible for a Forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or Show Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus j'ose croire n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis is that it Rousseau
