From Darius Lecointe Subject Re What RIGHT Joakim Ruud writes Recently I've asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live according to his rules we will burn in Well with what RIGHT can god make that desicion Let's say for the sake of argument that god creates every one of us directly or indirectly it doesn't What then happens is that he first creates us and then turns us Well I didn't ask to be Let's make an If a scientist creates a unique living creature which has happened it was even does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or Who is god to impose its rules on us Who can tell if god is REALLY so righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep unable to do otherwise that follow the rest I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm I mean How should one deal with a man who is convinced that he is acting according to God's will and who there Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by stabbing you in the back Voltaire
