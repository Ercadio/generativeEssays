From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died In article Jason Smith wrote For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping 'cid LSD Frankly speaking I didn't really It was fun It didn't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a tremendously greater risk of serious birth For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women as I could Frankly speaking I didn't I didn't care that I was putting each one of them at risk as well as their future partners It seems you lived a fairly 'wild life' my background is far more traditional mostly working working Maybe there's a clear indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain amount of anxiety that needed to be Religion was one possible While my more stable environment didn't and still does not produce the situation where I feel such This is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden while I haven't felt it so Regards Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the
