From Tim Scott Subject Re RFD In article T Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva writes I would like to add my support for a discussion I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting T I read in but I differ with him her in believing that at least some minimal parameters should be agreed Thyagi wrote I recommend that the depth of generality indeed of AMBIGUITY in this newsgroup be Calling the Tradition old or new is rather unnecessary and only leads to foolish There is no doubt that Nature is a splendid teacher whether she appears in the words spoken by a tree or by a stream a microbe or a Let us not limit ' ' to 'philosophy' But if we don't limit it to something the discussion degenerates into a big amorphous Other questions Thyagi proposes are What is this 'actual process of reality' Why is Taoism based upon an assumption Why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known What is the value of not knowing What is 'a Tao' What does it mean to be 'Tao'd' It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the category of general metaphysics I would prefer any to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated with at least semi orthodox Taoism with established classic works definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about I think neo Taoism should be excluded or get its own group what I mean by this is Humpty Dumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever a poster says it This could also be a refuge for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual alchemy from Thyagi again Taoism does what the hell it wants I tell Taoism doesn't 'Taoism' is no more real that 'Tao' Decide Real or not real Exist or not exist When shall we be certain Kent gloomily predicts quoting from Thyagi's article However most traffic in the group will likely concern the philosophical secular taoism averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr and yogic taoism as it pertains to medical sexual and martial I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of What's happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy Zen by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The Tao of this that and everything With respect to some exceptions like the books by Jou Tsung Any other comments ideas I look forward to seeing On balance I say let rip and let the chips fall where they If it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to these groups just as they do Tim Scott sending from Megatek Corporation Scranton San Diego CA USA FAX Internet or megatek tims
