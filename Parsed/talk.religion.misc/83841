From Robert Weiss Subject lds Thief goes to Paradise Kermit goes off tangent Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said and then address Kermit's John Redelfs originally jr I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his jr death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of It jr requires faith in Christ proven by following him by keeping his jr Such cannot be accomplished on ones Tom Albrecht ta So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the John Redelfs wrote back jr Paradise and salvation are not the same Salvation is jr Refer to John I responded to John rw I don't see the effort to equate salvation with rw rw Rather I see implied the fact that only those who are saved rw may enter To which Kermit kt Incomplete reference kt kt See also the discussion Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt for the arguments that Paradise and Hell sheol are places after death kt The discussion no LDS were involved as far as I could see argued using kt standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt LDS kt kt Christ went to paridise after his death and kt kt He taught the prisoners and freed them from kt kt When he was resurrected he had not yet ascended to his kt kt The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt terms for those I The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise before entering into No one has made a point for or against that issue nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom Luke the place of the righteous dead in sheol equivalent to hades The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent on their death Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was contradictory to what John's position put The thief on the cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise the abode of the righteous John's position possibly needs to be Kermit needs to address the topic at Robert Weiss
