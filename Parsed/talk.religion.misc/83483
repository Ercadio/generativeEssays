that the theory makes, and try to observe them. if you don't, or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some evidence against the theory. if the theory can't be modified to incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false. for example, people used to believe that the earth had been created
10,000 years ago. but, as evidence showed that predictions from this theory were not true, it was abandoned. -russ paul-jones
