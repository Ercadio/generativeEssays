From Robert Parker Subject Re Tieing Abortion to Health Reform Is Clinton Nuts Patrick Taylor The Sounding Board writes In article Robert Parker writes Read the whole There's some pretty hot stuff in Apparently you didn't read the whole You continue to miss the Gregg Skinner writes Robert Parker writes deletions soapbox on If it's ok to pay for legal procedures with gov't money then let's get the government to pay for counselling that provides abortion Let's get the government to pay for adoption Let's get the government to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary Why not They are certainly legal Counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides abortion How about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is comfortable Your adoption funding idea may be a good Any idea if it is feasable The only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort before I give in to paying for I believe it is wrong and I won't pay for it without a I'm not for making them unlawful I'd rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court hearings and all this other CRAP we are spending our time You know who's really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff I say let's pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more supportive of the birth Let's eradicate the stigma reduce the cost pay the price for Making adoption easier on the birth mother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for Abortion is not done just because the mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it to Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy soapbox off A person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another Cool You'll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement than getting people to agree to For example I perceive I have a right not to participate in what I feel is I don't think the government should On the other hand since we are having trouble proving that it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so choose either by legal means or Of course persuasion is allowed but watch that line between persuasive and The second part is a definition of a A simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of Most normal adult human beings are good examples of people Most children over two years old are people as The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with It is actually more complicated than that but I have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to Read the thread Why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and But why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe US Surely you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of consideration Then please justify why being human automatically makes something And why that includes the If the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for That needs to be It is part of the If Clinton has a medical program to get underway let him address this It is cheaper in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of At least if his plan No they are not guaranteed to become productive members of Even if they do that is MANY YEARS in the future until which they are a burden on someone or There is also the matter of the Forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of Actually I was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal I admit I did not say it very clearly and apologize for To refuse to fund abortions is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no This is really flawed It would be like me saying I was born with a disfigured face and I want cosmetic It is discriminatory that I cannot make that choice and so you must pay for That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill sic for that Ok It's like We are footing the Maybe they will take choice Maybe they will take choice Maybe they will take choice They can't afford any one of If they take choice A we'd have to pay them say If they take choice B it would cost us If they take choice C it will cost us now and a hell of a lot more for the next Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for Now some people happen not to like choice Other people happen not to like choice C paying for it that is C has been around and paid for for Even though it means we spend a lot of money we can't in conscience refuse to pay for Now A has been around and is perfectly legal but it hasn't been funded in the Now A is going to be funded but some people They don't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice So we could refuse to fund A at Then those women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C which will cost all of us more Most of us don't see any reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing personal choice from some The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother We will also still fund B and even C if that is what the mother However some women will certainly choose A and that will then save us we otherwise would have had to Your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your objections to Actually your taxes are not really going to go down as I'm sure you would point But the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another like our massive If you disagree then give us some reasons Given that abortion is LEGAL and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon I refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical WHAT I say objection to the procedure is Uncle Bill doesn't pay for breast augmentation facelifts Why abortions It's elective surgery Those other procedures you mention only cost There is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without In fact there could be additional costs down the road because of This is quite different from the case of As for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too SO YOU ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS Think about A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded what's she gonna What choice have YOUR PLANS given Your kind of double talk really makes me This is We are not refusing to make the alternative affordable too If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then your statement would make But that is not the case so it doesn' If Clinton tried to block funding for pre natal care and delivery or left it out of his health care plan I would certainly I would also be quite Pro choice Ha Pro Abortion really fits in your Yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you If you're gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very YOU STUPID FUCK WE DO want to fund all the YOU are the one who wants to NOT fund all the IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just throwing money at it but cutting costs legal costs we won't need abortion Your humble opinion is still Even with easy adoption there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several Months in which a young woman could need to be getting an like finishing High School entering college finishing college getting a that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few that have a massive impact on her future have a right to life A fetus is not a You can not have a conversation with Let's kill the mentally incompetant as Or how about people we just don't like since we can't have a conversation with You can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant And even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just don't like it is still possible for others to have a conversation with It is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a They are not biologically Nor was my son at the age of He was breastfed and would not take a Just what does biologically independent mean I'll be happy to punch any definition full of He was still biologically At least to the same extent you are He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal He breathed his own A fetus on the other hand gets it's nutrients already digested by the It gets its oxygen from the mother as That is not biologically Their awareness is Aha You admit it is Yet you are willing to kill it even if it may be very I suggest you re think your Awareness is only part of what makes a member of society It is the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of I keep asking but I still haven't seen a real justification for why the life of a non sentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient I haven't read every response on the threads I've been asking on yet so we'll see if I see one They have no experiences in the real world to make up a This is also true of quite a few Unix So D Anyone who can program in UNIX has a lot of experiences in the real Rob
