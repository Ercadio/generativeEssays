From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Davidians and compassion In article e e bm FM JUTS ccc amdahl com , Anthony G Rose wrote I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity knows about the word compassion Christians, do you think the actions today would produce a good picture of your religion Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity The two are not comparable This is always an option when the sect is causing harm, re label the cult to something else Cheers, Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the net
