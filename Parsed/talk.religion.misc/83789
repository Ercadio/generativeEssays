From Paul Hudson Jr Subject Re Part and part re Homosexuality In article writes Perhaps you don't get it and maybe you never Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and There were many injustices in the middle And this is truely I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality or any other The church is not called to take over the governments of the It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today but that does not mean that we should teach Christians to practice homosexual Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the final effect of posts like that of yours and Hudson is that YOU have a conditional love for Condition Change and we'll love This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional love one that calls people just as they And you accuse me of judging When did you look into my heart and see if I have I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should I don't know very many homosexuals as it But Jesus loves homosexuals just as He loves everyone If His love were conditional I not know Him at We should show love to homosexuals but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to stumble and continue in their That is a very damaging and dangerous The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called I forget the whole definition off hand but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto is Working for a fag free America with an implicit advocation for This is sick and it seems to be what you and Hudson and others are That is I could just as easily say that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal and that this is what you are I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral that does not mean I endorse using violence against There is a problem of hatred in the But there is also the problem of what has been called unsanctified Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon and have gotten militant in the This is truely Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people He told one man to sell all He He told another not to say good bye to His His words were hard at We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin many people have already been innoculated to the Link Whatever Rich
