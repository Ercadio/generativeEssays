From Dr Nancy's Sweetie Subject Re Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern I posted a summary over in and I suppose that it might be useful Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows I present it as For a short summary a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity and Mr Holly blames that on the The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department which studies other religions and how to teach them about A few years ago they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry they concluded that it was not a religion and therefore was outside their However Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry and last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study I got the feeling that they were saying You got the wrong answer last time try to do better and get the answer we Anyway there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions but the dust has settled and the report is Nobody is entirely happy with it but everybody seems willing to live with Both sides are saying things such as This was the best we were going to get in the current The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug The report acknowledges that many well known Christians are and have been Masons and notes that many teachings of Masonry are supportive of Christian faith and practice Examples of the latter include belief in God emphases on honesty and integrity and that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian On the other hand they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible with Southern Baptist These included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious the taking of certain oaths even though they are not meant seriously the undeniably pagan and or occultic writings of some Masonic leaders the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works and the racial discrimination practiced by many Masonic I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole aren't really in a place to speak on this last The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured but left to the discretion of This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity another may Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church and this history probably influenced how the report came The information above was gleaned from The Religious Herald a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia and Baptists Today which does not have any direct links to a religious Autonomy is a big issue among some Because I have neither the report itself nor whatever Masonic documents are relevant to these issues none of the above comes with a Your mileage may Void where Darren F Provine Milton We use only the finest baby frogs dew picked and flown from Iraq cleansed in finest quality spring water lightly killed and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with Praline That's as may be it's still a
