From T Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva Subject Re OTO the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the The word of Sin is Would I kid you Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Taken out of context words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior of the Order to which I When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background but surely he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the Order for many Yet as people change so do Orders change and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself perhaps by testing the limits Let us examine this issue a bit more In Karl Kellner a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist as well as a high grade Mason founded the Ordo Templi Kellner had traveled widely in the East where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss who had worked together prior to joining the The Order was first proclaimed in in Reuss's Masonic publication 'Oriflamme' On Kellner's death Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme' published in announced that the Order taught secret of sexual Theodore Reuss was an interesting Born June in Augsburg he entered Masonry in He was a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott a leader of the Golden Dawn who later introduced him to John Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites Reuss settled on the development of the The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' For example he chartered Papus in France Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and Spencer Lewis in the In the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order When Crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his All was well until when The Book of the Law was translated into There was a break in the continuity of the Manyk members split with the new over the book which Crowley was actively promulgating through the He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon An Introduction to the History of the by Ad Veritatem IX' Within Equinox III Edited by Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior Rex Summus Sanctissimus Caliph of the United States of America Published by Samuel Weiser There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in Equinox III And this is the real point is it not Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers A picture which leaves room for very many It is quite easy for me to see for example that all of derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way Will I I think Why Because my Frater will see it as a perspective an interjection I am using as an My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X' Please look more I do not support Reuss's words myself as I am not qualified to assess them and I am critical of their If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then what can this say about the health of the Order Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic requirement How shall we resolve these two possibilities I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual They are quite often artists and Having met some longstanding members in the SF Bay Area many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus In these moments I followed my intuition and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different I'm happily participating in social groups Feasts or Initiations and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too There are many ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this Invoke me under my Love is the law love under I am I Frater I Nigris DCLXVI CCCXXXIII
