From stephen Subject Re Biblical Backing of Koresh's Tape Cites enclosed In article name stephen writes For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most Are you the spokesman for most people I've enclosed a partial list of the sources he cites or quotes he exactly As a Christian sermon it's pretty good if not Though I differ in part on some of his conclusions the argument he presents is well backed which is why it's taken me this long to work through still If you thought it was rambling that says far more about you than it does You've made me What does this say about me That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary Those in the church know the language though and have no such First Seal in Revelation the entirety of Psalms and the most of Revelation which demonstrated one of his major points about how the writings in the Prophets including David and in the Psalms and in Revelation are all telling the same story when you understand how they're related ie have the key They largely explain each Charles Manson used revelation as Do we see a pattern here I wonder if Koresh liked the Beatles You missed the point which is that the Prophets the Psalms and Revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special event a Koresh was a nut okay Just because he found ways for the Bible to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a How are you able to make such a conclusion Please note that the first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those in the That said it doesn't hurt to try to see what the prophecies are ahead of time for those outside the Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed for the message he I'll type this very slowly so that you can He either set the fire himself or told his followers to do Don't make him out to be a He did not get killed he killed So you It should be interesting to see what the investigators conclude and what the final judgments In the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten The evil was inside the All that thou shalt not kill So much for war and government Oh yeah one last point for the believers Philippian For the rest of us could you please post the text Very glad you asked since I goofed it should be Philippian here from NIV Because of my chains most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry but others out of good The latter do so in love knowing that I am put here for the The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am But what does it matter The important thing is that in every way whether from false motives or true Christ is And because of this I My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord are human and Whatever we preach no matter how eloquent or how corrupted is of little Those who know the Master's voice will recognize Him a gem stone amidst Such is also the lesson of the For those who have an ear to J stephen
