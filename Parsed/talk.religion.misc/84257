From Pope Charles Subject Re Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention Lowell Morrison writes In article Tony With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity I thought the following quotes by James Holly the Anti Masonic Flag Carrier would amuse you The following passages are exact quotes from The Southern Baptist Convention and Freemasonry by James Holly President of Mission and Ministry To Men N Beaumont TX much drivel deleted Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His disciples and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian Page The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity through fraternity liberty and equality is This is seen in the writings of the 'great' writers of Freemasonry Page more drivel deleted I hope you all had a good laugh I know I did g Tony A Laugh Tony this religeous bigot scares the shit out of me and that any one bothers to listen to him causes me to have grave doubts about the future of just about Shades of the Branch Davidians Jim Jones and Charlie Uncle Wolf Member Highland Lodge F AM Grand Lodge of California Babtized a Southern Babtist And one who has beliefs beyond the teachings of Not to The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost every major Xian church there For centuries And still they They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists I am They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by One thing is A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons And the Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the Boobtist Witch Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals they may now start in on their Mason Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 'em out of the leadership positions they have taken So as far as I am concerned the louder ruder and more outrageous an Anti Masonic Crusade these old goats mount the Pop some pocorn and get a center row The circus is about to And Oh Look HERE COME THE CLOWNS Pope Charles Slack Pope Charles Origin The Brewers' Witch BBS Houston TX
