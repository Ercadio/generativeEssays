From Dave Butler Subject Re NEW BIBLICAL CONTRADICTIONS Fallaciously ANSWERED Judas I produced an error last week about CHORION By the way Mr DeCenso you really should have looked in the index of your Bauer Arndt Gingrich Greek You would have found that the word in Acts for lot is kleros not CHORION as stated by Mr Archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to Theological Dictionary of the New Testament by Bromley is the meaning burial plot It discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions nothing about CHORION or burial Why does this not surprise me Thus it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference I was I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar and thus confused kleros the second to last word in Acts as being the plot of land In actuality it is chorion which is the last word Acts Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so I cannot report as to the nuances of the I abhor publishing trash I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject I do not feel dishonest though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed it is not nontrivial by any means and I still am not competent with it but it is not as opaque as I had thought It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer Arndt Gingrich Greek Lexicon renders each verse in order each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable the syntax is far from On the other hand a Greek English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more And yes the word for field in Acts is indeed Now I've checked several Greek English lexicons Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Louw and Nida Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament Grimm Word study Concordance Tynsdale A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings Bauer Arndt Gingrich The New Analytical Greek Lexicon Perschbacher In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as A space place region district field area country place land farm estate a bit of tillage and similar Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about As some of these books go into great detail I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into contradictions to be once again as your friend said it lacking in substance and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness By the way Mr DeCenso I would have honorably presented my results on this matter even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions By the way among these lexicons eg Robinson's is the definition of agros the word used in Matthew to describe the field The word agros is defined as a field in the Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to This is significant as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was which stated that the word for field in Matthew ie agros is different from the word for field in Acts ie chorion and thus we must be talking about two different fields Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home So as of now unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise eg a reputable scholar with reputable references I consider this particular issue See Mr DeCenso now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter the day of the Crucifixion Tyre and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the Potter's Later Dave Butler Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge and he who does not teach exactly does not teach at Henry Ward Beecher American Clergyman as recorded by George Seldes
