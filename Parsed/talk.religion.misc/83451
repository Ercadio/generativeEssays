From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Food For Thought On Tyre I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned Tyre Here's the outcome from the research condenced versions copyright San Jose Mercury news Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed people and wounded A car bomb blew up in Tyre killing people and wounding A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off southern Lebanon early today killing the two men aboard the army command It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as The army said no one on the Israeli boat was The affiliation of the slain guerrillas was not immediately Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal battled Sunday in Tyre Lebanon with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades killing at least four people and wounding police Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro Iranian kidnappers had held Western Officials of the militia Amal led local journalists through the catacomb like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village Kawthariyet al Siyad near Tyre the ancient port city about miles south of The officials said they were certain that Marine William Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road outside Tyre in February I counted articles during these years of I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between and It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place I counted articles for my home town Kristinestad so from now I will consider this place to be a fishing village Cheers Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the
