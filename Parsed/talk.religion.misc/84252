From Dave Davis Subject Re Christian meta ethics Russell Turpin as is his wont has raised some interesting issues in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Unfortunately he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as Also unfortunately perhaps I have a deadline in two weeks the responsibility for which prevents me in good conscience from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray as it Let me then say what I can The two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of This point for the who also still read books is pursued throughly in Kaufmann Critique of Religion and The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if he has ultimate This is a theological statement worthy of Dr Turpin DD may wear the black robe of Geneva yet Indeed many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one's neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god to make things come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate Once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among I wouldn't make that assumption I don't think it is a reasonable And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted There are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the Christian god behaving in just this Michael and I and others read 'the Bible' with Christian Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT even to the point of dominanting Some points in the OT ceremonial dietary laws are explicitly abrogated by the NT To drive Russell Turpin's point with adequacy one needs to begin with NT texts probably from Matthew and probably about damnation Just trying to help This part is I discover what most moves me to post mls I am a radical Christian only in that I take the gospel No Michael the conservative Christians also take the gospel What differentiates you is the way you interpret the Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced not to say Michael's self description much The equation of radical liberal which seems implied by Russell Turpin is Radical conservatives are possible if sadly lacking in numbers at present Thomas Merton was a radical even though conservative in some St Francis was a radical How many examples are needed mls Why don't I and the myriads of other Christians like me mls tell you something about Christianity Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter Klingons have two hearts so my metaphor is not mixed just extraterrestrial Russell Turpin in an earlier post had said that Michael Michael's theological positions actually didn't tell him much about Christianity Dean Simeon responds this time gently 'What do you mean ' More direct perhaps would have been 'What could you possibly mean ' The implied rhetorical effort to separate Michael from the tradition is a Michael is in the If your idea of the tradition doesn't include him Change your idea of the tradition The irony here is that there is nothing in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence from Michael on this issue yet ' nothing ' is a hideous One verse is enough to refute it I'll offer two from Paul of all people 'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor ' Galatians I don't quote single verses as a rule and I don't carry them in my head and ' Nothing shall separate us from the glory of ' roughly from Romans If Russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses I'd promise to get the full context for any that he requires In short it is the extra Christian principles that make Michael's Christianity beneficial and I suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by Christian This conclusion does not follow even in short from the argument that goes A surprising logical Dave Davis These are my opinions activities alone QOTD Wild beasts trapped in their cages are not so fierce as are the Christians to each Julian the Apostate
