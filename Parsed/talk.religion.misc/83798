From David Joslin Subject Re Silence is concurance For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between Jim and I Jim wrote the following to me in e mail after I pointed out that he Jim had taken a quote out of context In Robert Weiss writes a promise from Psalm Gee since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical you must be really busy arguing against these out of context extracted translations He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss toward I pointed out that I did in fact agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of Hence I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a Needless to say I don't have time to reply to every article on that takes a quote out of I asked Jim the following So according to you Jim the only way to criticize one person for taking a quote out of context without being a hypocrite is to post a response to every person on who takes a quote out of context Jim replied by saying Did I either ask or assert that But today we find four articles from Jim one of which has the subject Silence is concurrence James Meritt writes Is it not the case that in the eyes of the law when someone is aware of something and has the capability of taking action and does not that individual may be held responsible for that action Which is of course a complete red Taking quotes out of context isn't a I don't have time to read every article on and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them Does silence is concurrence imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question read what he has written and decide for But back to the context of my conversation with Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect Today we find another obscure article posting it twice didn't help make it more clear Jim titled Inductive Logic Scenario A white goose waddles past the door A white goose waddles past the door A white goose waddles past the door repeat an uncountably large number of times A black goose waddles past the An individual hits it with an Given that the population of geese is uncountably large and the size of the confidence interval for the decision is undetermined under what conditions could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese be made If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed is it not a valid question to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese More red Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles Could Jim mean that because I axed his articles but not Weiss' articles he wants to conclude inductively Well I can't see where he is going with But I can help him with his I've written roughly articles since The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists where I take the position that they are making bad Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments a straw man argument earlier and taking quotes out of context more Think hard about this See the pattern Think Run it through your induction engine and see what pops dj
