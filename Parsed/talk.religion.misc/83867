From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Jim Burhill writes Would you consider the word of an eye witness Peter to testify to the events surrounding Jesus' life There are two problems here Brian Kendig writes Peter died two millenia The original letters he wrote have long since decayed into If he were alive today and I could Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great Tilgrath Pilisar III Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the Great Artexerxes Their documents have decayed to dust Brian why another excuse Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is God might just be Satan trying to convince everyone that he's a nice guy or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world Peter wrote a bit of the What Peter says about God is what the Bible Consider the Bible a court Over the period of thousands of years various people come up and testify of their experience with the living Up comes Abraham the wealthy Up comes Moses once the high official of Up comes Elijah a Up comes David a mere shepherd who became Up comes the pagan King Up comes the pagan King of Persia Up comes Nehemiah cupbearer to the King of Then Matthew an IRS agent takes the Up comes Luke an Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for Up comes John a year old Up comes Peter a Up comes James the brother of Jesus Up comes hundreds of You hear testimony from fishermen IRS agents priests The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself I While you are listening to all this stuff you realize that King David could have never known John Solomon could have never known Matthew Nehemiah could have never known You realize that all these people are independent witnesses and so you rule out Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living Each experience is different but each experience has enough cross over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same What Daniel did not know about God the Highest Official of Babylon God revealed to John years later but with a different No two testimonies are Each testimony dares to venture off what is already Yet each witness's testimony even though different from those prior consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same As we stare gazing at the computer you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net saying I know this God I am He has revealed himself to me He also calls himself Jesus John Please believe I am telling the It is wonderful to know Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer programmers fiction With a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete hooey Would that not be the most audacious display of arrogance Do you actually think you know better than King Solomon King David or even Abraham Lincolnr
