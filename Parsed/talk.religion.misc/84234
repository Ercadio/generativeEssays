From Nanci Ann Miller Subject Re Theists And Objectivity Stephen McIntyre writes Can a theist be truly objective Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that God definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a It usually all has to do with how the child is brought From the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the Bible the Torah the Qur'an He is told of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed He is also told that to question this as children are apt to do is a sin a crime against God and to lose belief in the scrip ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its truth is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of You're missing something There are people who convert from non theism to theism after being brought up in a non theist I don't have any statistics as to how many That would be an interesting thing to I think that religion is a People are naturally afraid of the unknown and the People don't want to believe that when they die they are dead That there is nothing else after And so religion is kind of a nice Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe things science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of that if they just do this one thing and everything will be That they are being watched over by a higher power and its This has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains This is why I think it's kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to They are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from Anyway I'm getting kind of carried away But my point is that theism doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow up as a theist although this happens far too often Theism is designed to have its own Atheist Libertarian Pro individuality Pro responsibility and all that Nanci If you know and are SURE of the author of this quote please send me email If you are one in a million then there are and a half of you in
