From Brian Kendig Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Brian Ceccarelli writes Brian Kendig writes And I maintain Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own Are you your own master Do you have any habits that you cannot break If I have a habit that I really want to break and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it then I do There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the effort to break and I've done so there have been other bad habits that I've decided are not worth the effort to It's my choice either I am my own I choose what I want to I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more I don't always succeed but I never fail either I Do you have any habits you can't break Why not For one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity just as you've probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his Are you unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran If that's different then how is it different from what you accuse me of Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism How about sexual sins Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head Of COURSE That's For centuries religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second class humans that's one of the reasons I renounced my Do you insult people unknowingly then regret it Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself I don't insult It's not in my nature and it's not something that I want to do Are you truly the master of yourself Not yet but my life is the ground I use to practice The fun is in the getting there I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all That I sometimes say things I do want to say and then repeat my mistake I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my There are times I know I shouldn't say something but then say it There are times I simply forget a I in fact am not my own We don't start out perfect we've got to strive to be something I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the praise for There have been times in my life when I've made mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake I need Jesus promised me this And I took him up on his I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself I regard Christ as a I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and The only person who can really judge me is me I choose the roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as I don't always turn back there's no shame in When I need help I seek out my Do you see my point I think you're the one under the rock and I'm getting a great tan out here in the My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism come and join me It will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but it's well worth it Then I guess ignorance is bliss for Because Brian you enjoy not having a clue about the And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying Open your eyes and SEE open your ears and I'm not just spouting off empty This is my LIFE this is what gives me Don't you see I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega powerful as what you're trying to get me to Surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to don't you Can you witness motherly love with your senses How does caring and concern for you register with your senses If nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a Vulcan and You better get rid of your Huh You're going WAY off the track I say my mother loves How do I know you ask I can point to definite things she's done for me and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to You say your deity loves How do you know I ask You can't even convince me that it exists My God says that you will not CEASE You have life You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with That is what my God And that was the Your made up theism is what it is made It's wishful If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then I would choose 'hell' I can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way Yahweh Allah Zeus Odin Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the description of Kendigism deleted hee hee Why would you want to live a good life To you you die and that's Don't contradict You have no reason to live a good It doesn't do you any good in the Your life doesn't do anybody else any good either because everyone dies So you have no reason to lead a good Leading a good life is Why do you do such a meaningless thing That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word I've Have you ever gone to an amusement park Why I mean after a few hours it closes and nothing's different except that you're a few dollars Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good at Why do you do such a meaningless thing The answer is that you think it's You play the skee ball over and over because you'd like to get better at it even though you're not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on You ride the roller coaster because it's an thrilling experience even though because it scares the dickens out of In the same way I think life is And I don't intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night D I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it's not really all that Has the resurrection sunk in Jesus is Jesus is NOT So you and your holy book By the same token therefore Santa Claus delivers toys every Don't you see I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa Forget the Bible for a Forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or Show Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you're Forget that I am a Forget that I know how to Forget that I know how to put a sentence Forget that I know how to send e Forget my Proove to me that I I can't do it because your existence means nothing more to me than just your communications over the You have no more bearing on nor importance in my life than that remove it and you will cease to be significant to Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without invoking them Or do you mean that the existence of your deity and in fact any other deity that can be written about is as real as your own existence Why do you believe what you believe Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus j'ose croire n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis is that it Rousseau
