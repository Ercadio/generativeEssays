From Kent Sandvik Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died In article Brian Ceccarelli wrote Christ is Greek for Messiah Messiah means Annointed One Annoint means to rub with oil to anoint by to consecrate The major prophet Daniel uses the word Messiah in Daniel chapter How closely did you analyze the Bible Looks as if you didn't get past the first So was the catalyst to break your faith the priests who interpreted the Bible for you Did you ever do what the Bereans did to Paul's teachings in Acts Brian does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient Greek Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of Christianity I hope you are not Catholic because my Christian upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther and the one of the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin in order to learn about BTW your statement would also eliminate about of all the Christians in the world as Cheers Kent ALink KSAND Private activities on the
