Subject Re lds Rick's reply From ISSCCK Robert Weiss writes Rick Anderson replied to my letter ra In article ra Robert Weiss says ra Just briefly on something that you mentioned in You refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may not So what That is really We do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of It may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should I say bias but it is relevant to me and many You're right the bottom line IS truth independant from you or anyone Since you proclaim truths as a self proclaimed appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this Because it says so in the Bible Does the Bible say so or is it YOU or someone else who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truths haven't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are Of all the preachers of truth on this net you have struck me as a self righteous member of the wrecking crew with no positive message to me or other latter day saints BTW this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite s ye preach about me with your lips but your hearts are far removed from Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been In order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you Look who's talking jumping to conclusions You wouldn't do that yourself right All YOU address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration The Bible states that Lucifer was The Bible states that Jesus is the creator of The contradiction that we have is that the LDS belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds The former KGB would have loved to employ Jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know The Mormon belief is that all are children of There is nothing symbolic about This however contradicts what the Bible The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God Correction it may contradict would YOU think the Bible The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in His Satan and his followers have rebelled against God and are not children followers redeemed of God but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of The field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one Matthew So This illustrates nicely what I just said the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have shown works of repentance and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the The issue of satan's spirit offspring and those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non related of nice scriptures deleted NOT Robert copyrighted ra We are told that And this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast ra John Life eternal is to know the only true Yet the ra doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly ra different Jesus a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of ra the They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus is indeed different than your Jesus and CAN be reconciled with the Jesus in the Not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly couldn't care ra one as being true denies the other from being According to the ra Bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God and ra not the construct of In this single posting of yours I've seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the pro lds mails combined I have read so far in this news First get your lds facts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true God whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him I guess your grandiose self image does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your Not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every This is really a red It doesn't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to The fact that some groups try to read something into the Bible doesn't change what the Bible What the Bible teaches Or what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and I respect the former I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected On the And by the way I do respect your interpretations of the Bible I even grant you being a Christian following your own image of Him as much as I am a Christian following my own image of Him in my heart Most of the other replies have instead hop scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official ' I don't think that it matters if McConkie's views were That is not the Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this subject is the real The indication from Rick is that they may certainly The issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis represent or ridicule the lds The issue of official doctrine is obviously very McConkie's views have been controversial The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie's Bible in mormon circles on mormon I rather look to official doctrinal sources to Hugh Nibley's books The last comment is an lds insider Summarizing McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and But having said this I find McConkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thought provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial I'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this Robert Weiss
