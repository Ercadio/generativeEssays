From Subject THE DIVINE MASTERS THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree and correctly so that Jesus Christ was a Divine Master and a projection of God into the physical world God But there are some very important related facts that Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of as are followers of most other world First Jesus Christ was NOT unique John NOTWITH There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master God Incarnate PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY both before and after the life of The followers of some of these Masters founded the world's major religions usually PERVERTING the teachings of their Master in the Christians for example added THREATS of ETERNAL DAMNATION in Hell and DELETED the teaching of Secondly and more importantly after a particular Master physically dies and leaves this world there is NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE Therefore all those Christians who worship Jesus and pray to Jesus and expect Jesus to return and save them from their sins are only KIDDING THEMSELVES and have allowed themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly MANUFACTURED by the And emotional feelings are a TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator for religious These things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions including Thirdly the primary function of each Master is to tune His Initiates into the AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM or SOUND CURRENT referred to as THE WORD in John and as The River of Life in Revelation and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a silver cord True Salvation which completes a Soul's cycles of REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes is achieved only by reaching at least the SOUL PLANE which is five levels or universes above the physical universe and this canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY Living Divine One such Divine Master alive today is an American Sri Harold Klemp the Living Eck Master or Mahanta for the Eckankar organization now headquartered in Minneapolis Box zip Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji now living in Punjab India and is associated with the Sant Mat One of the classic books on this subject is THE PATH OF THE MASTERS Radha Soami Books Box Gardena CA written in by Julian Johnson a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of that time Maharaj Sawan Singh Several of the Eckankar books including some authored by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores or obtained thru inter library The book ECKANKAR THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS by Sri Paul Twitchell is ANOTHER Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with the Anti Christ which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so called last days But the Masters don't ever rule even when asked or expected to do so as Jesus People who continue following Christianity Islam or other orthodox religions with a physically DEAD Master will CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation between the Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world until they finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY LIVING Divine RE INCARNATION The book HERE AND HEREAFTER by Ruth Montgomery describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation as a FACT OF LIFE including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past lives about accurate the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up especially with a bad hypnotist SPONTANEOUS RECALL especially by young children some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives homes possessions DREAM RECALL of past life experi ences DEJA VU familiarity with a far off land while travel ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of and John How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born unless he LIVED BEFORE ALWAYS use the KING JAMES VERSION Later versions are PER VERSIONS Strong INTERESTS innate TALENTS strong PHOBIAS typically originate from a person's PAST For example a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in THIS life because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF KARMA Galatians Revelation People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future or in a FUTURE INCARNATION COMINGS If a Divine Master physically dies translates before a particular Initiate of His does then when that Initiate physically dies translates the Master will meet him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a It is an INDIVIDUAL experience NOT something that happens for everyone all at People who are still waiting for Jesus' Coming are WAITING IN PLANES OF EXISTENCE The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of Above the Physical Plane is the Astral Plane the Causal Plane the Mental Plane the Etheric Plane often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane the Soul Plane and several higher Spiritual The Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN counting upward from the Physical The planes between but NOT including the Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic It is likely that ESP telepathy astrological influences radionic effects biological transmutations See the book with that and other phenomena without an apparent physical origin result from INTERACTIONS between the Psychic Planes and the Physical The major planes are also SUB For example a sub plane of the Astral Plane is called Hades and the Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it created there LESS THAN YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a THREATENING The Christian Heaven is located elsewhere on the Astral Good Christians will go there for a short while and then REincarnate back to SOUND CURRENT BLIND FAITH The Christian religion demands of its followers an extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more than GOOD FEELING which is TOTALLY DECEIVING If a person is not HEARING some form of the SOUND CURRENT THE WORD THE BANI THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL The SOUND CURRENT manifests differently for different Initiates and can sound like a rushing wind ocean waves on the sea shore buzzing bees higher pitched buzzing sound a flute various heavenly music or other In Eckankar Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as a This and other experiences such as SOUL TRAVEL REPLACE blind For more
