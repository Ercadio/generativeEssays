Subject Re rw Is Robert Weiss the only orthodox Christian From Brian Ceccarelli I'm curious to know if Christians ever read books based on critique on the religion classical text such as Age of Reason by Paine or The Myth Maker by Sometimes it is good to know your enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand both sides and not solely the one and only right Yes one I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think Benjamin Franklin once a I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf and it is amazing how much he I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotelian What a pile of Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like Psychology the id ego superego by Freud Elements of truth but Jesus explained it far better and gave Thomas Paine Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson are mere They can screw up the Bible just as well as any I do not put these men on a And if I remember 's autobiography correctly he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever Here's some more circular reasoning to Paul says to the Corinthians that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world because it is spiritually And so people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is From your point of view that's incredibly circular and To me it is mysteriously and supernaturally I can see it but you can' This is not arrogance on my Trust It is as bizarre to you as it is to But nonetheless it is a truth explainable or Are any of you color blind to red and green I Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots If your eyes are perfectly normal you can see letters or numerals embedded in the They are a slightly different color and stand out from the But if you are color blind to red and green you will not see anything but gray shaded That is how a dot test appears to I do not see a pattern at A normal seeing person will see the And to him I seem like a total To him I appear as if I am missing the universe or It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as That it what it is like with the Bible the Word of God to the The believer can see the meaning in the I can see how the patterns fit There is such Such But then on the other hand I notice the non He doesn't see He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing I look at him and say No you are You do not Then it is time for a sanity I go to another Christian and say Do you see And they go It is an X And I say Thank God I see the X It is truly the strangest It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase He will make the blind see and the deaf I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to I wish every non believer could see what they are
