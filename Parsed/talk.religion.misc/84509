From Paul D Boxrud Subject Religion and marriage I wasn't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to but I guess the misc is there for a Here I am getting married in June to a devout Wisconsin Synod I would classify myself as a strong agnostic weak This has been a a subject of many discussions between us and is really our only real We don't have any real difficulties with the religious differences yet but I expect they will pop up when we have I have agreed to raise the children nominally That is Lutheran traditions but trying to keep an open I am not sure if this is even possible I feel that that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open Anyway I guess I'll get on with my Is anyone in the same situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this We've taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting anything get bottled up Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this much bigger than it actually Any comments would be greatly Also please e mail responses since I don't get a chance to read this group Paul
