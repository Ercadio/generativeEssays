Subject Re Christians above the Law was Clarification of pe From NUNNALLY John Nunnally When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question In paraphrase On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they are above the Law and above the Prophets major and minor and not accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion in Matthew What is the source of this pseudo doctrine Who is the pseudo teacher Who is the Great Deceiver OK here's at least one Christian's answer Jesus was a JEW not a In this context Matthew makes Matt Do not think that I Jesus came to abolish the Law or the Prophets I did not come to abolish but to Jesus lived under the Jewish However He was the culmination of the promises of the He came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey God's Verse says For truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law until all is The key to this verse IMHO is the last Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the Law was supposed to Verse Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law this makes In general it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about doing away with the That was not Jesus' intent at He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve Gen The serpent will bruise your heel but He will bruise his Jesus appeared to be doing away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only God's In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their In Galatians Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to the faith which was later to be Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by But now that faith has come we are no longer under a For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ I believe this says that after Christ was revealed the Law had served it's purpose our tutor to lead us to Christ and now we are no longer under a The law has been fulfilled as Christ said he would God the author of the old Law and the Christ Man Jesus are the same Therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last will and testament of Jesus are based on the same moral It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re expressed in On the other hand now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the mysteries of this new Baptism representing Christ's death burial and resurrection The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice I and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection Matt Acts OK That's one Christian's I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other Please excuse the long Thanks for your interest if you have read this John Nunnally Nunnally
