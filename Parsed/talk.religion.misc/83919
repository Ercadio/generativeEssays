From Paul Harvey Subject Re Jewish history question In article writes In article Mark Israel writes In article little 'e' writes deleted Here Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated into Greek a long time ago Yes that's a famous version called The It was a translation made by Greek and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon I don't know what you're referring to When the Jersusalem Temple was destroyed some manuscripts may have been lost but I think our extant Hebrew manuscripts are as good as our Greek I don't know about any originals The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts scrolls and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions or perhaps just as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes in power groups he I dunno The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the The Greeks had a love of wisdom philo sophos and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian The Christians got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling into Moslems hands far more likely since they were the book burners not the Moslems or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned Either way a tremendous amount of information was The destruction of the library of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man against So I was just wondering since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions is the Hebrew version of the Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version There are a few famous discrepancies Isaiah's prophecy about a young woman was changed into a virgin which was how the New Testament writers read it but not Actually the Hebrew almah young woman was translated as the Hellenistic Greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the modern and technical English term The Jews did not have the type of virginity cult that the Greco Romans had in Artemis and Well perhaps this is the answer deleted If you go to a Jewish bookstore you'll get a Bible translated by Jews so there will be some differences in interpretation but the text they're translating from is basically the The standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Jews of course use the text in its original Hebrew without If you want to read the original you can buy an Interlinear That contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament with an English translation written underneath each If you want a Bible with a possibly more original basic text you can try to find a Samaritan Good luck I've never seen The Samaritans no not the Good Samaritans have their own version of the Books of They claim the Jewish bible was altered by Thanks for the Now I just have to find someone to teach me Samaritan Just me little 'e' so is a good Samaritan hard to find or is a Oh finish this
