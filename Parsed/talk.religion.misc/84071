From Bob Sarver Subject Re JUDAS, CRUCIFIXION, TYRE, Etc Frank DeCenso But how It's evident from the texts in Ezek that God isn't concerned about buildings or structures God is concerned about people The people and leadership Ezek never did return as a city Others may have come later and built a city, but the people and leadership that God prophesied about in Ezek were never rebuilt as a city of people and leaders How incredibly fucking stupid Of course the text is referring to the city itself buildings, bricks, mortar, etc Otherwise it makes no sense to refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a place to spread fishing nets Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you won't do to preserve your faith from admission of error, DeCenso
