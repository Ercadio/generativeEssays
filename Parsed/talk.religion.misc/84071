From Bob Sarver Subject Re JUDAS CRUCIFIXION TYRE Frank DeCenso But how It's evident from the texts in Ezek that God isn't concerned about buildings or structures God is concerned about The people and leadership Ezek never did return as a Others may have come later and built a city but the people and leadership that God prophesied about in Ezek were never rebuilt as a city of people and How incredibly fucking Of course the text is referring to the city itself buildings bricks mortar Otherwise it makes no sense to refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a place to spread fishing Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you won't do to preserve your faith from admission of error DeCenso
