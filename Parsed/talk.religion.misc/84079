From Brian Kendig Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Jason Smith writes Brian Kendig writes And I felt torn when I began to disagree with a lot of what the Bible and my priests told me Did it start getting a little uncomfortable Did your style start feeling a bit cramped Yes that's exactly what I My heart just felt that what I was being taught was wrong a basically good message but framed in I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their lifestyle that pride in one's work is a bad thing that Jesus died for me I don't want ANYBODY to die for me especially as an impersonal act where the person can't possibly even know me well enough to really know if I'm worth dying for or I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message of Christianity then so be Maybe I'm just not compatible with I just refuse to follow rules blindly and since I can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it I've got to just follow my own conscience in these I know how that Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me outside Don't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I don't believe in your I will not steal and I will not murder not because I fear divine repudiation but because these just aren't in my You may think there's nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree stealing things when I'm able insulting people for the heck of it because I'm not answerable to anyone but you'd be I'm answerable to A life like that would be a cheap life I happen to want to earn respect in 'Till I met the Man that My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul searching and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of God with I finally decided that I had once felt this presence just as I had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed that I had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived Since then I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does But there are a few times when in my darkened room by my bed I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and called out to whatever's out there because I want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I And I have not yet received an Only when I truly listened to myself body and soul did I realize that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being There is a higher truth in the universe and Christianity just ain't Any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why It may well be Scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the three dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two dimensional plane onto a three dimensional sphere see Sphereland the sequel to Flatland for more thoughts on this Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate That is there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with OK you may So now if I'm just being good am I doing good enough That's for you to If you feel you're doing fine then go ahead and ignore us foolish little We can present what we've seen and experienced providing our witness but it isn't up to us to make that seed Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt trips insinuations that I'm without morals arguments from disbelief how can you possibly believe that God doesn't exist and so All I'm asking is for you to convince I want to be convinced but it's not going to be So much as you don't like what we're selling there just may be someone out there that can identify with Methinks you could give us all a lesson in tolerance and back Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside I view it as harmful in many It preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once it's got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of others who do not share these Maybe you'll say that your religion doesn't teach that but I've got to judge Christianity from the Christians I I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy fulfilled I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice I think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don't agree with Obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the Christian's faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we propose Precisely my You've still not given me a reason to be a Christian instead of a Buddhist or a The nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in it is that eventually you'll be able to feel justified in most anything you want to Y'know your Fortunately for everyone around me I'm not I'm a just as the Moslems aren't religious and the Buddhists aren't Who is religious then Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus j'ose croire n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis is that it
