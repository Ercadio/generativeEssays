From mlee Malcolm Lee Subject Re A KIND and LOVING God In article Rob Lanphier writes Malcolm Lee mlee wrote Do you consider Neo Nazis and white supremists to be Christian I'd hardly classify them as Do they follow the teachings of Christ Love one Love your neighbour as Love your Is Jesus Christ their Lord and Saviour By the persecution of Jews they are violating all the precepts of what Christ died They are in direct violation of the teachings of Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders of that time loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one The enemy is Satan not our fellow In Mark Jesus is quoted as saying Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be I consider most Neo Nazis and White Supremisists to be Christians because a They say they are b They feel it necessary to justify their actions with the Bible Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute Jews Isn't it love your enemies instead They may say they are Christian but do their actions speak differently Do you believe what everyone tells you I don' I came to believe in God by my own investigation and And ultimately by my own Salvation however was granted only through the grace of The Bible provides us with no clear definition of what a Christian It tells us what a Christian should do but then it goes on to say that as long as you believe your sins will be To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart what does that say of your belief White Supremisists and Neo Nazis may not be your brand of Christian but by believing in Christ they are White supremists and Neo Nazis are NOT any brand of If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot see What does this belief entail Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it I am a Christian but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such then are you not pre judging me BTW I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist Christians as you call Anyone can say what they believe but if they don't practice what they preach then their belief is Do you concur Now for your original statement What bothers me most is why people who have no religious affiliation continue to persecute Jews Why this hatred of Jews The majority of people who persecute Jews are NOT Christians I can't speak for all Christians and there are bound to be a few who are on the anti Semitism You imply here that it is predominately atheists and agnostics who persecute I am hard pressed to think of even an example of Jewish persecution in the hands of atheists Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial intolerance and They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with About the only one that comes to mind would be in the former Soviet Union where many religious people suffered some sort of persecution not to mention many atheist agnostics who suffered persecution for believing the government sucked No arguement Rob Lanphier The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT If they have not repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are NOT These are the only criteria to being a May God be with you Malcolm Lee
