From drake Drake Subject Re RFD In article writes Let us not limit ' ' to 'philosophy' But if we don't limit it to something the discussion degenerates into a big amorphous you a Taoist Imposing limits does do something gives you something to go It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the category of general metaphysics I would prefer any to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated with at least semi orthodox Taoism with established classic works definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about I tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of I especially tend to frown on any suggestion that orthodoxy or classics have any special place in I think neo Taoism should be excluded or get its own group what I mean by this is Humpty Dumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever a poster says it This could also be a refuge for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual alchemy So rather than debate what Taoism REALLY means you are suggesting that we take someone else's word for it and work thusly I'd rather not thank What's happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy Zen by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The Tao of this that and everything Whereas you of course have a clear idea of what the word means Can you tell the Tao Any other comments ideas I look forward to seeing On balance I say let rip and let the chips fall where they Wonderful it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to these groups just as they do Only if you choose to define failure in that Or to define it at I believe in the flesh and the appetites Seeing hearing and feeling are miracles and each part and tag of me is a Walt Whitman
