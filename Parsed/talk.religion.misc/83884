From Brian Kendig Subject Is it good that Jesus died Brian Ceccarelli writes Brian Kendig writes If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert Be warned however that I've heard all the most common arguments before and they just don't convince Ask Jesus He himself said why in John It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive Read Jesus's own reply to your John Most assuredly I say to you unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it produces much He who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal If anyone serves Me let him follow Me and where I am there My servant will be If anyone serves Me him My Father will Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one If we were created by a deity why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us Why would I want to live forever The challenge in my life is that I will die and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that My time is here and will someday pass I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends and once they too are dead then I will no longer have any reason to In short even if your deity does exist that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship I am content to live my own life and fend for myself so when I die I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up it will be because of my actions and my If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this then so be I would much rather just cease to But if your god wants my respect and my obedience then it had better earn these and if it does then they will be very strong and Jesus gives more reasons in John But one obvious reason why Jesus died and as with everything else it has nothing do with his punishment was that he could rise to life again so that we would stop doubting and believe John The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the It is an obvious Do not overlook Without this obvious point I would have no hope and my faith would be Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead I think it was Osiris who did the same as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend if memory But still WHY would I want to rise from the dead Why do you want to Why did Jesus suffer in his death Again ask Jesus says why in John That's no mystery The world hates him without It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus how much we need a If your god wants to win my devotion then it knows what it can do provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any And why can't you Brian accept this How can you The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows John That's precisely I neither see nor know Zeus either nor Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus The animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of John and You've got to understand my point of view I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all Truth is it's Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply he just rattles them off day by Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality and I point these out where I But even more than that even when Christians do try to explain the verses in their own words they do so from a Christian point of view which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly and then all strife and suffering on the earth would Here's the problem with that substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead of Christian and it means the same Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD you've got some convincing to I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of I am not perfect But regardless of that I thank God that Jesus revealed himself to me without whom I'd also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very Person who created me and who loves And in my opinion you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself I'll keep my beliefs to myself but as soon as you start waving them around expect me to toss in my opinions Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun de ceux que j'ai vus j'ose croire n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis is that it Rousseau
