From Roy Crabtree Subject Re That Kill by Sword Must be Killed by Sword In article stephen writes In article Kent Sandvik So are you happy now when people including innocent kids died today It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the One thing for sure Koresh will have no chance to defend himself against the statements lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification made by agents who participated in the situation that killed I don't know they murdered him I also don't know that the Branch Davidians set a fire and It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such comments in advance of forensic Stephen thank God Kinda I thought something like this was going to happen over a week One of the things that's been obvious from the start is that when there are two armed camps neither of which yields it's usually get slaughtered when any little spark sets it Which is why Koresh and company shouldn't have stockpiled weapons and why the BATF shouldn't have come primed for a Am I the only one to notice a No peaceful attempt to serve a b Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it c ah God children at least adults plus at the beginning and more BATF agents all Painful point If the Davidians fired first why were the BATF on the roof rather than taking cover Has anyone asked themselves these questions Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the opening rounds I seem to recall missing several key parts a The first five minutes of day one only the shooting part comes b What happened to the Feds video units You mean they do not carry helmet cams Wonder why not How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record a You realize the units carry ittle bitty backups That hold minutes per unit And there are twounits on the professional handhelds so no tape turnover gaps b Until all views are seen it is premature to point fingers in either As you well point out Anyone BATF BD X BD Other could have touched it off by mistake or maliciously More on this Once Koresh was disregarding his being a religious leader and apocalyptically obsessed most likely the people inside just went on Just like the BATF Is the lesson that automatic responses are very hazardous last resort measures But it is so hard toremain human under the full pressure of hazard game playing and Painful point Either side could have backed off to help defuse the We see the problem constantly here on the net with Ego Nuff More to the point when someone dies almost like it was intended that way both sides will kill to maintain their innocence a contradiction in Painful point It doesn't help to take sides in such a Just adds fuel to the Better is to let it burn out on it's Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out from the evidence seen what might have alternatively Best example I can think of is Christ with the tax He didn't have one and so didn't sanction the Roman authority unduly When they showed it to him he noted that it was Caesar's minting and so said give it to him no waste of time And then he got back to more worthwhile concerns God's This requires someone interested in God's Please note that the outstanding overt problem in this country today is one where the Government wants Caesar's coin to pay off the The anti tax movement of today and the anti ssan as groups would do well to note who the issuing authority Ditto for those Yes The AMerican Not the Federal ANd if it is not spent towards that end no one deserves the made in the image of Fewpeople hear the contradiction Money made in the image of God No need to stir things up in ever larger revo revo revolution as governments turn over and over and I wish you were Many pundits are saying The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce and my exposure to the Damned pardon me American Divorce Attorney is I have no money left to lose to taxes or painful point For many this was just Thumbs Thumbs Just another thriller like Terminator or a good old ball Is the lesson that we've become jaded to media reality children If anyone thinks blaming Koresh or the BATF helps this any at all is and The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that Koresh or his followers caused The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations and morals not my fault Koresh did it than they are with dead Same goes for Koresh his followers who are all mostly Painful point LA The Davidians In one case society has abandoned the people which has returned to a In the other the outskirts were bumping against the Is the lesson that what's lawful in different areas of society depends more on conditions than laws More on power and My personal opinion Look to history whenever privilege has replaced whatever token of objective law and justice a society has had Hitlerrs have If we don't learn the lessons or at least make an honest effort the next conflagration will no doubt be closer to Rather than putting out fires aren't there much more important concerns for us to work on You do your name sake proud Its hard but please keep on keeping on each voice in the wilderness now will save a generation unborn from horror Kent can't 'cheers' today What keeps me from being a bomb thrower is my loving God as irra tional as that is for so many One direct benefit is being able to keep things in perspective The day I need a gun or abomb to protect myself in this society is the day that society is already beyond redemption and that aint' redundant if you have any Christian belief and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the wrongs that my society practises without undue harm or punishment befalling me is the day that society has ceased to be a human society and become a society of We are very cclose to Such as who hurts more the ones who died or the loved ones who are left Besides the It's also time for many to Including those who've lost their faith in others or in I'm learning to be patient and let things God Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue still struggling to be For those who like contrary questions NB I was not I am not a Branch Davidian nor a law official I do hate liars or the six letter variety of The official side has its advocates already lets balance the equation and asj a few questions on the other side for the sake of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass innocent until proven not innocent until presumed Where are the video tapes from the tanks ALL of Don't tell me they do not They are standard So you think Koresh fired the place because of the explosion a Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread This aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non flammable as It is as non flammable as gotcha when in isolation from other WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote launchers WHy did the FBI not announce this window blown in plus tear gas five minutes then the wall come down and maintain a left to right sequence b Most aerosols also have a secondary compound that when mixed in becomes a VERY flammable and difficult to trace suspension with a VERY special property exposure to brief eruptions of high heat muzzle blasts or long exposure to low heat matches a stove will NOT tend to What other chemicals come up in the forensics Who else will be allowed to test the site c After a few minutes to hours ifdesired the combnation rate can be controlled as desired the mixture can be made to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature above a certain point a tracer round for a certain heat quantity a small explosive charge or for a length of time start a wall fire and wait Check your military records look at the Why were tanks large capacity delivey systems tear gas why not somnorifics and now why the was there still a comm channel open to the outside Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the compound in the videos ALL the videos Which ones are missing Do I sound paranoid Am I Probably You trust the FBI and BATF to render judgement IN advance of a Court God help For we are surely not helping ourselves You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate You are trillion admitted down and Look Did it happen that way I do not I was not AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO But will that happen people will NOT have the chance to tell their side as the BATF leader was on No one Except more force next Listen to your hearts Thanx again J stephen roy andrew crabtree roy red haired king andrew the virtuous one crabtree iron workers
