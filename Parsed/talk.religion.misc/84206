From David Ash Subject Theory on David Koresh My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle and died on Day of the siege On Day of the siege he rose from the dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the next days Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy, as Timmy Baterman's father in Pet Sematary could attest, so after days they did what Baterman did shot themselves and burned the place to the ground Consistent with the facts, isn't it Did anyone actually see Koresh between Day and Day David W Ash What profits a man if he keeps his eternal soul when he could have lived life to the full and HOME been forgiven at the end of it all anyway David Merritt, a k a THE RED SHARK
