From Russell Turpin Subject History texts was Ancient references to Christianity In article Mike Cobb writes Why is the NT tossed out as info on I realize it is normally tossed out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons Far from being tossed out the gospels are taken almost universally as the primary source of information about I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is Who tosses out the New Testament Undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why except for some naive believers who unfortunately far outnumber nonbelievers both naive and critical are the gospels not taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago This has an easy answer and the answer has nothing to do with miracles no text is taken this way by a critical There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text measures it by some set of criteria and then either confirms the text as historically valid or tosses out the I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school where certain texts are vested with authority and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious In fact most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying First all texts are historically ALL Or to put this another way I have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any sense when applied to a Second no text should be read as telling the gospel truth about historical events in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary NO This includes your favorite author's history of Every text is a historical Every text was written by some person or some group of people for some Hence every text can serve as historical The question is what can we learn from a text Of what interesting things if any does the text provide evidence The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi formerly of Oregon are historical The gospels are historical The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical The modern American history textbooks that whitewash great American figures are historical These are all historical evidence of various They are not much evidence at all that the Maharishi formerly of Oregon could levitate that Jesus was resurrected that vampires exist or that great American figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in They are better evidence that some people saw the Maharishi late of Oregon levitate that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected that many people in Eastern Europe saw vampires return from the grave and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence text or otherwise evinces This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized There are many books on the subject or various parts of the I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's Historian's Fallacies as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present It's relatively It's easy to Give it a Russell
