From Brian Ceccarelli Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died Brian Kendig first states I am my own I ask Are you truly the master of yourself Brian Kendig states Not yet Make up your but my life is the ground I use to practice The fun is in the getting there We don't start out perfect And we do not end perfect We are never Can you name one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect Good I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the praise for There have been times in my life when I've made mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake Then you lie to You do not know your I have clearly shown one of your shortcomings if not That is ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its I regard Christ as a Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion I bet you do not even know what the word Christ Or which prophet used Christ to describe the Son of Man I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and The only person who can really judge me is me I agree with So we must learn Read the Come up with our own Evaluate what is being said and by Check the history books as Compare someone else's interpretation with your Then make a But I tell you the truth of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs And remember the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being The Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed to people like you and These guys wrote down what they saw and Is it their open diary and they want to tell you And because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight forward I choose the roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as I don't always turn back there's no shame in When I need help I seek out my You have chosen the road that avoids the You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn't look appealing to You rather build your own One that goes far away from that But be assured of this you will have to confront him one day willingly or And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying Open your eyes and SEE open your ears and I'm not just spouting off empty This is my LIFE this is what gives me I see what you I hear what your I am not degrading your But I have heard the same irrational excuses for There is nothing new in what you are And by your own words you are spouting off If contradictions give you meaning then your life must be I say my mother loves How do I know you ask I can point to definite things she's done for me and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to You say your deity loves How do you know I ask For God so loved the world he GAVE his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting I look what God did He has given his Son even to his death so that I can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing but has glorious You can't even convince me that it exists Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and You choose to lie to yourself that he doesn't exist for you ignore what has been said for thousands of You sound exactly almost verbatim like the Lazarus of Jesus's story starting in Luke And the conclusion of that story is a bleak Lazarus wound up in The story ends like this For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets he won't even believe if a man rose from the If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then I would choose 'hell' I can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it Arrogance at its The fact is you are not Several specific cases have already been And again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in Jesus does not expect you to placate Jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for You maintain you have an open See whether you are lying to yourself for Why would you want to live a good life To you you die and that's Don't contradict You have no reason to live a good It doesn't do you any good in the Your life doesn't do anybody else any good either because everyone dies So you have no reason to lead a good Leading a good life is Why do you do such a meaningless thing That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word I've I do understand what you But that's is not what I feel went amiss You missed the Living a good life has no eternal Once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the To you it is To you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on But then you contradict From a previous post you said doing evil things is To you it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good It is all meaningless in the end So go rob a Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime What's restraining you Life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is In the same way I think life is And I don't intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night D At which time you are truly not the master of I'm sorry I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it's not really all that Has the resurrection sunk in Jesus is Jesus is NOT So you and your holy book By the same token therefore Santa Claus delivers toys every Don't you see I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses of Jesus say are But you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the By definition ignorance Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves and flying Ever see a flying reindeer Has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red On the other hand are people born in Bethlehem Was Nebuchandezzar really a king Was Daniel really one of his court officials Were David and Solomon really kings of Israel and Judah Was their really a king called Jehoachin Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem years before Christ Did Sennacherib really lose his battle and badly Was there really a Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus Yes yes yes history verifies It is Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction Perhaps you can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from that of the Scientific I suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal Is this what you are telling me Or is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out that it's not a fairy tale Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without invoking them Get Have you ever been to Zaire Do you have to go there to be assured that there really is such a place Given your irrationality I take it you have never used a map in your Why do you believe what you believe Given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living God I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow
