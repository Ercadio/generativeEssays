been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer
passage in josephus about jesus was inserted, but only that it was
modified. there is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what
origen says--that josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah), but
i don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a very
good one. (i haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the jesus
passage.) jim lippard dept. of philosophy university of arizona
