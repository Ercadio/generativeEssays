From Subject Re Biblical Backing of Koresh's Tape Cites enclosed In article stephen writes For those who think David Koresh didn't have a solid structure or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast I don't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his It's the deaths he's responsible for that concern most I've enclosed a partial list of the sources he cites or quotes he exactly As a Christian sermon it's pretty good if not Though I differ in part on some of his conclusions the argument he presents is well backed which is why it's taken me this long to work through still If you thought it was rambling that says far more about you than it does There is a very definite relationship between the You've made me What does this say about me First Seal in Revelation the entirety of Psalms and the most of Revelation which demonstrated one of his major points about how the writings in the Prophets including David and in the Psalms and in Revelation are all telling the same story when you understand how they're related ie have the key The largely explain each Charles Manson used revelation as Do we see a pattern here I wonder of Koresh liked the Beatles The sequence following is keyed to the Koresh tape should you care to check it You can almost see the note cards he used when doing the long list of Biblical references which impressed me tremendously but were deleted in the interests of common Koresh was a nut okay Just because he found ways for the Bible to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed for the message he I'll type this very slowly so that you can He either set the fire himself or told his followers to do Don't make him out to be a He did not get killed he killed In the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten The evil was inside the All that thou shalt not kill Oh yeah one last point for the believers Philippian For the rest of us could you please post the text
