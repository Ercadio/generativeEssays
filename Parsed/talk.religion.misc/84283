From Nice Guy Subject No knock was Re Who's next Mormons and Jews Isaac Kuo states in reply to deleted article about no knock searches arrests The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly marked as officers and yelling Police This is used every day to bust drug The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun As for not knocking it's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even Usually this strategy works if it didn't then it wouldn't be used so commonly now would it In general no knock raids are to preserve evidence like drugs which can be flushed down the They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank If there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands If the suspect does not come out tear gas will be comment on the BD omitted I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every Furthermore we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed Do you suggest It is not a method to apprehend that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects How far can they reasonably go to identity themselves What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the competition It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal It is the most dangerous way to arrest The cops are charging into a room and they don't know what is in It is much safer to surround the place and announce Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that's not an excuse to murder In the case of the BD's there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be Cops are not cops until they identify themselves as police Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system If they are arrested they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals not to shoot Cops are shot on no knock drug raids because the criminals aren't aware that they are No knock raids on homes occupied by non criminals are more likely to end in Mom and Pop citizen KNOW that they have not committed any crime they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not Cops and homeowners may The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were In this case the no knock warrant was not called It is difficult to flush a gun down the The ATF could have surrounded the A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the folks would have kept Rod Anderson I do not think the United States government Boulder CO is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves satellite on ao Slick Willie the Compassionate
