From David Wood Subject Re Laws of God was Re A KIND and LOVING God mlee writes David Wood writes Malcolm Lee writes These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had expressly set apart from the rest of the The Israelites were a direct witness to God's To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to God's chosen But Jesus has changed all of We are living in the age of Sin is no longer immediately punishable by There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus And not just for a few chosen Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile Sorry if this is late for the thread I thought God was supposed to be constant and never How do you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above God never Sorry but yes he does by your own He still loves Sending Jesus was one of His attempts to reconcile with Humorous this notion of an all knowing all powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your Also while we're at it How do you reconcile A KIND and LOVING God with the Judeo Christian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable by death Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing KINDness and LOVE Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate There are several OT passages to back this God is But all humans are sinners thus all pre Jesus humans should have been punished with We aren't punished with sin now of course because God has He required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His Yet he does so He has The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our Besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is He tolerates sin in Hell which surely is in his midst as Also given that he is all knowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does tolerance have to do with All of this is absolute nonsense unless your god is not indeed all knowing and all powerful or unless he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you And the Israelites knew this And still some of them chose to disobey and were Were these people KIND and LOVing themselves Not The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your The nature of his creations victims is not at God gave them every break He could but in the end He really had no choice in the I see an all knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an all powerful god who had no choice in the Seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own He sent His Son to die for us to be the ultimate sin Did I miss something Did you give some indication at to why a KIND and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of having made a mistake He sent His Son as a consolation to us out of I note that your answer physically follows my question but I fail to discern a connection between the By the way for what am I being consoled Now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that for our sins God now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather than killing us immediately If so is this eternal damnation an example of A KIND and LOVING God Hey let's be fair for a moment KIND and LOVING does not mean a free Why not By the way I note for the record that you didn't answer the There is an amount of give and take as in any Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that children can do whatever they want NOT Part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at Death and or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment I hope you aren't a Part of being a parent means giving God tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow He teaches what is right and what is This is quite an elaborate fantasy that you've constructed but sadly it lacks a basis in It also does not address the questions that I The consequences of our actions are made clear to us be it Heaven or be it If God did not follow through with what He has warned us about He would not be a very good The god that you describe is not a good parent but a In parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it the children will not take that parent's words very God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to By life's trials we see the folly of doing our own will rather than He warns us about the consequences of rejecting Him when it comes time for Sorry was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow or the god of the Koran The Vedas The Book of Koresh Oh yes it's all so Do we follow Him I Bully for
