From Rob Lanphier Subject Re A KIND and LOVING God Malcolm Lee mlee wrote I will clarify my earlier God's laws were originally written for the Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people not just the Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Just for reference here's the earlier quote Malcolm Lee mlee wrote in reference to Leviticus and Deuteronomy These laws written for the Israelites God's chosen people whom God had expressly set apart from the rest of the The Israelites were a direct witness to God's To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to God's chosen But Jesus has changed all of We are living in the age of Sin is no longer immediately punishable by There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus And not just for a few chosen Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile These are two conflicting To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of I don't mind people shifting their position on an It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was What about Deuteronomy Is it wrong now Did Jesus change that If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you In the following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God Sure he does However he doesn't address the notion of stoning non virgin brides because this needs no Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy is not patently clear in its intent I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world a lot of modern day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in Depending on how they use this knowledge they can be They can argue any position they desire and back it up with selected parts of the Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph I will qualify this by saying I don't know if they actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainly made the means look However just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible but believe every In fact this is probably scarier since there are far more of these people from what I've In addition they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees since they don't know enough to debate with these Christianity is not just a set of rules it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal And it demands obedience to God's No it demands obedience to a If God came down and personally told me how I should behave then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing However if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia even longer for the OT even if I follow everything in it with my heart I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it Well if God respects it so much how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non believers I see little respect eminating from the god of the I see a selfish and spiteful God be with you Not yours thanks Malcolm Lee Rob Lanphier And for the curious here is my earlier post Hmm for a book that only applied to the Israelites Deuteronomy Jesus sure quoted it a lot Mt In addition he alludes to it in several other places Mt Mk Jn And just in case it isn't clear Jesus thought the Old Testament isn't obsolete I'll repeat the verse in Matthew which gets quoted on this group a lot Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill I tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of Mt NIV in pretty red letters so that you know it's Jesus talking This causes a serious dilemma for Christians who think the Old Testament doesn't apply to I think that's why Paul Harvey likes quoting it so much
