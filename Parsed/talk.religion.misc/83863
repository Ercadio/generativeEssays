From Brian Ceccarelli Subject To Rob Lanphier Dear Rob When I read Brian 's postings I find someone who is honestly seeking the When I read your response here I see When you reply to a post reply to the post you This statement undermines any good points you might have had it was enough to make me stop reading Sometimes I do come across condesending and I am sorry I come across that way at Thank you for the reproach I really do appreciate I'll try to get Rob at the same time I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh Brian so far only responds to the And I am glad he responds at In both cases of approach my intention is to be I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across I apologize for Rob sometimes Brian comes across as I know But Brian vasillates back and One post looks honest the next is an Now he wants me to explain the universe in words or I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of I just want Brian to be honest with If he really wants to know he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock From my perspective Rob when I look at Brian Kendig I see a man standing out in the middle of a Off into the distance I see a Mack truck heading right for him but Brian is faced away from the oncoming He doesn't see Here's is how I see the dialog Me Brian K please step aside before you get run BK There is no Me Turn around at BK Me Look You will be healthier if you do take a look at the oncoming BK Explain to me why trucks Me Turn around or you will run BK I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Me You blind fool Why do you choose ignorance You have nothing to lose if you But if do not look you will certainly lose your I do not want to see you squashed all over the BK It is my life to I rather not Besides a truck running over me will not harm And by the way I really have an open So is my motivation to belittle Brian or to love Brian the best I know how I do not wish to single Brian Kendig Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their I I can now see the truck behind My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the My fear though is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway where he will certainly get run But if he so chooses he so chooses and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his For it is his But at this very moment Brian hasn't gotten even that He is still at the point where he does not want to Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me but his head will not turn around to see the entire So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the Thank you again Rob for your I really do appreciate My wife tells me the same thing at I will try to do
