From Steve Gallichio Subject Re NHL team in Milwaukee Charlie Betz writes After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought I'd pass along a story I heard This is second hand so I don't know how true it is but I have no reason to doubt it Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey The owner of the Admirals sorry I can't remember his name either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Lloyd Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of million was too Like I said I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if it's true don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime The Admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as Yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than He felt that no one would pay for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than But the market fooled him and teams have been created for apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than and I doubt that he could get one for that Pettit gambled and Now he'll have to pay SG
