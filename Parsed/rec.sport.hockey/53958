From John Huber Subject Re Leafs Crushed Again Blues Win Flames Back In article A , Joseph Charles Achkar writes In article vzhivov cunews Vladimir Zhivov writes The Blues, led by the best goalie in the NHL this season, Curtis Joseph, shut out the Hawks The Blues are playing like they did in ' clutch 'n grab, shoot the puck out It's incredibly boring to watch, but if it works Finally a non Blues fan agrees that Joseph is a great goalie I think he should win the Vezina this year or at least share it with Barrasso who also has been shadowed by Mario's amazing performance I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the Vezina I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates this year I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin receive for their goaltending I do think that they are great in the nets, but I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years playoffs The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front of them and the goaltenders get the most credit I would rather face shots a game, than have to rely on Joseph saving , but if the goalie is going to face shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them Jay ps Go Quebec And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned as candidates for this years Vezina, but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso this season John W Huber, Jr aka Jay Penguins , Stanley Cup Champions Software Engineering Institute Pirates , , NL East Champions SEI MasterCraft The ONLY boat for skiing
