From gballent Greg Ballentine Subject Re Wings will win In article Randy Graca writes gballent Greg Ballentine writes Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the I think Quinn is one of several who are Plus his team Quinn's has improved a much greater amount than Detroit since he took over with How do you figure Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year They both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less Specifically if I remember correctly third place teams How does this make Vancouver more improved Further if I'm not mistaken the Wings had more points than Vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many When Quinn took over Vancouver several years ago NOT LAST YEAR they regularily missed the I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably Quinn has improved the team from non playoff calibre to a serious When Murray took over in Detroit the were about a team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a Quinn is one example of a better GM than Gregmeister
