From Gary Leung Subject Fuhr Deserves Credit Was Sabres sweep Fuhr's role In article Joseph writes In article Robert Andolina writes Many people have suggested that Fuhr's play is the only reason that the Sabres beat the While Fuhr was a critical factor I would not overlook the fact that the Sabres finally got some scoring from people other than Mogilny and LaFontaine Khmylev Sweeney Hawerchuck Indeed LaFontaine played hurt and didn't score many Also the team played better defense although not great than in the regular Fuhr deserves a lot of credit but not all of Robert I agree with I also think Fuhr's contribution for Sabres's win is just the same as many palyers in the Mogilny had six goals in four games including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after Fuhr had The key for Sabres's win over Boston is whole team's strong commitment as an underdog and all their talent players including Mogilny and I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well I still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr the series would now be tied He virtually stole games and for the In both of these games Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to Especially in game Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied Even in game when the Sabres won the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres However if it hadn't been for Fuhr the Sabres wouldn't have been up I think it was through the period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open up the game thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the In my opinion Neely Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine Mogilny and The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan Sweeney Wood and Khmylev compared to that of the Bruins checkers However the Bruins defense IMO played better than the Sabres defense the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall The difference in the series was Fuhr who outplayed Andy Gary Go Sabres
