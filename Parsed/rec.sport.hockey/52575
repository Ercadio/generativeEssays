From Deepak Chhabra Subject Re Potvin's new goalie mask Stephen Legge SLEGGE writes I was wtahcing RIGHT GUARD HOCKEY WEEK on TSN yesterday and they had a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for NHL They talked about how they are made what they are made of and the designs that are put on them Actually this part was really It turns out that the mask is custom fit to the goalie's The goalie puts his her face through a piece of wood or was it plastic with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to Hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic wrap type material and vaseline is put on the goaltender's Then a plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about minutes to dry When it dries it is effectively a mold of the goalie's This is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on namely a new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re working of his current mask with the bear on it and new mask for Bob Essensa which was really cool the Jets logo was on the chin and there were two fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air brushed back Yeah Essensa's mask looked really The best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking black panther on the forehead it has to be a new mask for Felix Potvin but he never said whose it Actually I thought I heard him say that it was Potvin's for I would bet money on it either it did look awesome
