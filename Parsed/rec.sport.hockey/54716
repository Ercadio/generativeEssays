From Chuck Lownie Subject Re Leafs vs Wings In article BB B LMARSHA cms cc wayne edu LMARSHA cms cc wayne edu Laurie Marshall writes In article A Chuck Lownie writes In last nights game Toronto received FIVE penalties, Detroit none If Which game were you watching Didn't you see the third period when the Wings had penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty The Leafs had a man advantage for about a minute and a man advantage for another minute or two and the Leafs still couldn't score And I wonder how the Leafs scored a powerplay goal if, according to you, they never had a powerplay In the Detroit paper today, it said there were penalties called in last night's game And you're saying Detroit had none of those penalties I'm guessing you only watched the first period I have to admitt the Leafs did get alot of penalties in that period where as the Wings didn't get many if any at all Haven't looked at the box scores yet But, the ref more than made up for it in the third period Laurie Marshall Wayne State University Detroit, Michigan Go Wings My apologies for the typo I meant the Wings had power plays in the first period and the Leafs none As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game
