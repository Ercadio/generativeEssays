From Mark Spiegel Subject Re SHARKS Kingston Fired In article CSD nlu Nelson Lu writes In article Mark Spiegel writes In article CSD nlu Nelson Lu writes I said Gund will have to open his CHECKBOOK I didn't say give up any draft picks or promising If we could have gotten Murphy for the great but I agree the Sharks shouldn't give up young talent or early round draft I listed Chelios et al only to indicate the TYPE of player I think the Sharks need to pick The rules on signing free agents less than years old puts a big restriction on what the Sharks can pick However I do believer they need to pick up some players who will add toughness to the But you have to remember that you're unlikely to get any real quality free agents who do not require The Sharks tried with Makarov who was probably the top of the class among non compensation free agents but even he probably wouldn't have helped too Don't expect to get top quality just some I don't view Makarov as a player who would add Size hopefully won't be much of a worry next Alexander Cherbayev and Michal Sykora have agreed to multi year contracts and it appears that Mike Rathje will also sign All three are pretty Size alone isn't We all know how much fear Kolstad struck in the eyes of opponents NOT Well Rathje and Sykora are both highly touted prospects unlike And Cherbayev was initially supposed to play for the Russian WC Anybody know what happened there That means that he's likely to be good Nelson you're confusing skill and McGill Hammond Johan Would you really rather have those two instead of Johan By your logic then you enjoy having Falloon and Ozolinsh on injured reserve By your logic then you think that if the Sharks had kept McGill and Hammond that you can guarantee that Falloon and Ozolinsh wouldn't have gotten hurt Think again there was a chance that McGill would have caused Ozolinsh to get stuck at KC and as you know Hammond is worthless and McGill is almost Well Wilson maybe but I don't think Falloon and Ozolinsh were really injured on who said they were If they weren't then I don't see any justification that having McGill and Hammond around would prevent their If the injuries of Falloon and Ozolinsh were purely accidental then what could McGill and Hammond have done to prevent them Hey get off the McGill Hammond I'm no fan of My point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing this This year we had more skill I'm all for that but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they can't do you much Whether it's a cheap shot or not you can't let the other teams push you The Sharks simply got pushed around to Other teams knew They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not pay for Adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players or to take cheap It doesn't guarantee no injuries nothing does but it's something the Sharks can do to reduce the number of mark just say Mark Spiegel Cow Palace K Epicenter
