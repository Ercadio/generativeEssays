From Gerald Olchowy Subject Re This year's biggest and worst opinion In article writes Messier is a joke this year bad back not His play is the reason the Rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of Gartner is my choice the guy works his butt off every Kovalev no He's played adequately but as bad defensively Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger needs players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and not know how to turn them into Bure and as was predicted in Perhaps he'll pull an Alex Mogilny in a couple of years and surprise us Zubov wasn't expected to make it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries has proved to be a very pleasant Get Muckler as coach and Kovalev will look like The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got players like Messier Kovalev and Graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches who are interested in rope a dope If you want the Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and get a Mark Messier who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks from a known loser and you don't waste your draft picks on players like Gerald Gerald
