From Paul Francisco Subject Re NHL LETTER Roger's Response Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger but actually a truly held In article Roger Maynard writes I would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that I belong And I don't share those And I don't believe that the majority of posters on share those And so I have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without making my feelings on the subject For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important enough to say something I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong It represents a subset that you don't belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this isn't a moderated group Look there are several ways to state an opposing Three that come to mind are as follows Say it Result it may not be Say it directly yet Result probably it will spark some interesting Say it directly and Result validity goes right out the I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely You realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against Paul Francisco In the shadow an angel Front Line Assembly
