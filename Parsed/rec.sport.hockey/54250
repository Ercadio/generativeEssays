From Mark Spiegel Subject Re NHL Draft In article SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes In article Jon Carr writes When is the draft this year And will there be any coverage I know the upcomming NFL draft is on Anyone got the details Paul Kariya Pick perhaps He won't last long I don't know the exact coverage in the In Canada it is covered by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage I don't know As for the picks Ottawa picks which means it is almost that Alexander Daigle will go He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or IMO I would take He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Daigle didn't show this for his junior San Jose will then get Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob Niedermayer a center his brother Scott is a defenseman picked by NJ a couple years ago They brought him in for a physical tryout a week or so From what I have read Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft plays BOTH offense and defense and isn't afraid of physical Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of defense prospects Rathje Sykora Ragnarsson and our centers Kisio et al are getting With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't see them picking yet another small player like Kariya he'd just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated mark
