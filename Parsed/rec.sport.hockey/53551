From George Pandelios Subject Re Patrick Playoffs Look Like This In article Jan Brittenson writes In article George Pandelios writes The Pens won't be playing Montreal because Boston will win Adams divisional Buffalo and Quebec will make decent Boston out of sheer determination will win a game against the Pens but no They have heart but the Pens have too many big guns and too many ways to If Boston does indeed win the Adams nothing is certain and indeed gets to play the Pens then I think you'll find a very different Boston team this Boston will use every trick in the book to shut down the Pens offense something they didn't even try last The Pens' weak spot is defense and goaltending if Boston First I enjoyed reading your Second I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending for a couple of Barrasso has had a spectacular year no slow start consistently sharp GAA and leads the league in Tommy deserves the Given the lack of respect he commands though I doubt he will win The other reason concerns the Pens' team They are hovering around or in the fewest goals That is a big improvement for them and it indicates that they are playing better team can shut down the Pens' offense and get an early goal then you have a real If the Pens score first then it's practically I don't think the Pens have the discipline to stick to the team game if they're held scoreless minutes into the Boston doesn't have the guns of the Pens but the Pens doesn't have the defense goaltending and discipline of Still Boston can put the puck in the Remember that Boston is not a run and gun Patrick style team although they played run and gun hockey for the better part of the regular season who doesn't Even Neely backchecks all the way in behind his own net if Penalty killing will be a big Boston are I believe over the last something short handed situations meaning they have scored SHG while giving up PPG one in a lackluster game against Ottawa I'd say the series will go to or But I'm much less certain whether it will be in favor of the Pens or the B' Their styles going into the playoffs are too different to make it Still I'd place my bets on the Pens I My prediction is that if the B's can get the first goal in four of the games they'll take the Otherwise the Pens But I'd rather wait and see whether the B's will actually get out of the Adams to begin Buffalo Quebec and Montreal aren't exactly planning to call it a game and go home Jan Brittenson We'll It'll be George George Pandelios Internet Software Engineering Institute usenet sei gjp Fifth Avenue Voice Pittsburgh PA FAX Disclaimer These opinions are my own and do not reflect those of the Software Engineering Institute its sponsors customers clients affiliates or Carnegie Mellon In fact any resemblence of these opinions to any individual living or dead fictional or real is purely So
