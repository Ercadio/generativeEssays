From Mark Shneyder Subject Re BUFFALO , Boston Defense In article A Gerald Olchowy writes Fuhr is proving the Fuhr bashers wrong, but Boston is an awfully good team Yeh,but Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St L wasn't very impressive His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind in their entire year history It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on his head Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the Red Sox best record in their major leagues as of now I would say that of the callers to the Bruins' flagship station SportsRadio are talking about the Red Sox,about are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft, are on the Celtics and about are on the Bruins Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding early PPV Mark
