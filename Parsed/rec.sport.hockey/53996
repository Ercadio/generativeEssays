From Ron Morris Subject Re Wings News and Playoff Thoughts I wrote I feel the jury is still out on Tim Cheveldae as a playoff He was average in his first Last year he had a horrible start but played great the last ten games after he was His GAA even with the horrible start was last This year I think he's going to play very well he has to if Detroit is going to win the cup He wasn't sharp in game but he didn't have to I thought he looked pretty good Charles Hubbert Great write up of the Wings Toronto series thus I agree with just about everything that you said but Chevy shouldn't have let the shot from the right point First goal Mikorov I Other than that the Wings are looking good and Chevy is holding his Not great but maybe Chevy has let in or soft goals so far but they all didn't However his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it The score was I think when the goal you mentioned was In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming back Chevy was I can see him as a Barraso style playoff goalie inconsistant when there's nothing on the line but comes up big when really I guess we'll both find Ron And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry I'm getting bored reading the same problems in the paper decade after I want people to have to deal with new President Bill Clinton
