From SHOE Mark Shoesmith Subject Re Let's talk In article Tom Arnold writes Okay you hockey playing fans finatics out I'm looking over the wide range of aluminum sticks for the first I've been playing with pieces of lumbar that seem to weigh alot and break after a few uses so I'm thinking of changing to an aluminum shaft so when I break the blade all I have to do is change The problem is that there is such a wide reange of models and selections out there that I'm not certain which to Can any of you post some of your suggestions and experiences with the aluminum sticks What is the difference between models What do you like dislike about them And which brands are best I've had and still have a few aluminum I got my first when I was a Christian and broke the shaft halfway through the season two years I bought another a Canadian at the beginning of the next season and I still have I also have an Easton that a friend was getting rid off after giving up the I find that Easton blades are easier to get but all brands of blades are pretty well Watch out for dried up bits of firewood that some stores pass off as In my experiences the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks but I've only ever broken one aluminum I like aluminum The blades are quickly changed even on the bench if you have On the downside the shaft won't break if you decide to impale yourself on it Ciao Mark This is between me and the vegetable Rick Moranis in Little Shop of Horrors Mark Shoesmith
