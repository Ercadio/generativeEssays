From Anna Matyas am x andrew cmu edu Subject Re Truly a sad day for hockey Joel Alvstad writes A fine year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars, or Norm's Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to play This is very sad indeed My condolences to the Minnesota fans who are losing their team I fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers We should always enjoy things when we can You never know when they'll be taken away from us Mom
