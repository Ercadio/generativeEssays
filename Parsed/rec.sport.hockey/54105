From Deepak Chhabra Subject Re Nords Habs in We was robbed In article Yaska Sankar writes Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased presently in the WE WAS ROBBED Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec I don't buy this at Roy was the reason the game was and that would not have been the case had Dionne kept his Roy stood on his head for the first minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end to Kamensky's mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later Ths is not Roy is the 'villain' as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap If you think Roy outplayed Hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first minutes of the third NHL goaltenders make some great If they did not they would not be in the NHL in the first I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally However when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's especially at such a crucial time in a game I don't think there are any legitimate Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces description of lucky Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays I am not arguing that Hextall was I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a but it was just the The timing stank but against an explosive team like Quebec they gave them opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally In a one goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the goal' I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty fact I think it was a boneheaded But it led to one goal only and Montreal had a two goal My main concern is the second This most certainly was a team Leclair missed his opportunities as did Bellows and Dionne took a bad Damphousse and Lebeau were silent Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all Roy gave up the bad Roy by no means can be singled out for this What you say about the skaters is absolutely But realize that the game was effectively won You could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' missed They are not important when the final result is If I get the time soon I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive Montreal was leading with a minute to The goalie is the last line of defence and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without But Roy gave up a lousy goal and a team cannot afford such a Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal WHO CARES Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play I could do a Hextall critique if you'd But if you're going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies and he still is in the top For the record I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the In fact I agree that he The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the They are no better than uninformed I assume you are referring to However I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on I have not said he sucks nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments' If you regard objective and informed FYI observations as derogatory I really can't help
