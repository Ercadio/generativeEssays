From Paul Valin Subject Re Montreal versue Quebec In article David Vergolini wrote Did anyone see the Montreal Quebec game yesterday It was tight right down to the last second of the third In the overtime Roy and Hextall played like they were Ok so Montreal won They deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high Their second goal in overtime was also replayed but I could not tell if it was the Montreal player who kicked it The puck definitely was not directed in by a Anyways Montreal is back into the The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec defender who deflected the The re play officials did not take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first non goal so it seemed pretty non I agree that it was a great game good to see Roy and Damphousse back into Hopefully the sign of good things to Paul Valin Tel Bell Northern Research Email Box Station C Ottawa Ontario Canada 'only my '
