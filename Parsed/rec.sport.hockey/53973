From Roland Dreier Subject Re plus minus stat In article Brad Gibson writes In article gballent writes In article Joseph R Mcdonald writes Jagr has a higher but Francis has had more And take it from an informed observer Ronnie Francis has had a much better season than Jaromir This is not to take anything away from Jaro who had a decent year although it didn't live up to the expectations of some Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman style He plays hard at all times doesn't disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good Bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice Throughout the year Francis consistently recieved more ice time than Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject I am pretty sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that When you add to that Jagr's better rating I think it becomes evident that Jagr had a better season not that Francis had a bad Actually what I think has become more evident is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all Jagr did not have a better season than Francis to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team's top one or two lines short handed etc I would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its Thank you for posting As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher than Francis I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of comparisons even on the same I never ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher actually reflected better two way In my opinion Francis's low is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he can chip in points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is even if his On the other hand Jagr for how big fast and skilled he is can't even get points no matter how inflated his By the way don't get me wrong I like He may be a lazy floater but he turns it on at exactly the right times like overtime of playoff games Roland Dreier
