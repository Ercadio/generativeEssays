From Matt Coohill Subject ESPN f ck up here's some gripe ing griping whatever I live in Santa for I think Okay ABC showed the Kings ESPN through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the Red Wings Toronto But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that ESPN would show Pitt NJ on Tuesday and Bos Buff on I raced home from work early Pacific to catch the game but ALAS it was the Boston Buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the Pitt NJ game on OVERNIGHT they changed their I didn't mind THAT I watched the game hockey is MUCH better than NO hockey During the game their were no video highlights from the Patrick What the hell was going on At least they should show video highlights of the other games especially the NYI Caps game that was so close My father lives in Bowling Green Kentucky Bumbf ck Egypt got to watch the Pens game on I just don't get The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want to see the Pittsburgh New Jersey game will turn on their TVs on Thursday and see the Pittsburgh New Jersey game instead of the Buffalo Boston game At least in my case I just had to wait more days to see my If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN I'd be mad as Oh hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR Matt Coohill The announcers for the Buffalo Boston were the worst that I have ever heard as far emotion goes They had the enthusiasm of Droopy Dog I hope for better on
