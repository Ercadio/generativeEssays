From Gary L Dare Subject Re mre Mike Eisler writes Gary L Dare writes I can't believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look But only in NY NJ Philadelphia and Everywhere else the only reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball Yes a point well taken however even in areas that finally got some games there's something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City and we'll try to get you an update through the show when you know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on I bet the ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the From today's Times ABC got great ratings in Chicago and Louis a and the Kings Flames got a on the West Coast but only a in metro New York the Devils squandered their newfound support from a year ago when they played the Rangers In comparison Seniors Golf did better Next week there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not 'cos I don't watch much TV the NHL should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going on the Even ESPN could've sold second rights to third party systems non SportsChannel since they are not making any extra money by sitting on the games hockey fans will not necessarily be watching pre season beach volleyball if playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere gld Je me souviens Gary Dare gld GO Winnipeg Jets GO gld Selanne Domi Stanley
