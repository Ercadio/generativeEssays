>during the roman era, 28 was considered old... last night during a sharks' broadcast, commissioner bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission. he made no bones about it,
the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of 26 are fully stable. this means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate. this is good, imo. there's no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold. -tom galvin
