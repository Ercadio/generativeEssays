From FRANK MICHAE SALVATORE Subject Re JETS FANS Hrivnak or Tabaracci After seeing Hrivnak and Tabarraci play who would you prefer to have And how about Tyler Larter What ever happened to him You know what my answer will be Hrivnak The choice is Ok but have you seen Tabaracci play yet In his two starts and his relief effort for Beaupre he has looked mighty sharp don't forget the I think he's let in just four goals over eight periods of I like Hrivnak but we might actually have to give some credit to David Poile for a change after this Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight I haven't jinxed Frank Salvatore
