From Randy Graca Subject Re Wings will win gballent Greg Ballentine writes All of this is I never said that Murray was a bad I merely said that he isn't the best GM in hockey or even a contender for that If Murray is as great as you claim the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now probably more than If he was as great a GM as you claim I think you missed one of my points It takes more than a great GM to win a stanley cup even Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine But the point of my original original post if not well stated was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching Which leads to below and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of I think at this point there's a personal emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical As outsiders it's fine for us to say He should hire a different In fact he has talked about doing so in the But the press here in Detroit at least has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second He needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his So it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic Perhaps but we're all a little that way from time to I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties and the team will improve as a I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM In that sense once he steps down as coach we'll see how good of a GM he really But Murray is an average unspectacular NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true I may not agree with everything you've said but it's been fun discussing it with Gregmeister Randy
