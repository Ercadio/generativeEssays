From Subject switzerland at WC what did happen to the swiss team last year they reached the semi final and now after matches no points and even no goals after the against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun by the russian team now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the B level does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for the olympic games ' in Lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them hopp schwiiz daniel
