From Deepak Chhabra Subject Re Stewart homered the Wings In article Ryan writes Roger Maynard wrote Once again the Leafs overcame the Red Wings in what was possibly the most exciting game played yet in this playoff Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have For most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity it was nowhere near the most exciting Paul Stewart called the single worst game I've seen this Federov's major was obvious and I don't dispute However Chaisson's penalty shouldn't even have been a penalty let alone a major and a game The minute game call is for high sticking There is no blood Just because Chaisson barely touched the poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesn't mean it is a Unfortunately the instant replay is not used on At first I immediately thought and a game because the hit looked much more severe from an intent to injure perspective than it After seeing the replay I'd say it deserved minutes for boarding it was careless any way you slice it If Stewart had replay I do not think Chaisson would have gotten and the In the second period behind Potvin Probert had the puck and was going to get out front and was tackled I couldn't believe the no This no call was bullshit I I admire Stewart for letting them go but Probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty I've never seen Probert whine either he doesn't need to Now if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards he's probably gone right I don't remember who on the Leafs touched the puck on Racine's shot towards the end of the game seconds left but Stewart called it out of play last touched by Everybody in the Garden including the Linesmen knew Yzerman protested but Stewart just laughed and really homered the This was also But once again no It was Rouse I'm really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call 's when the officials refuse to admit they made a But when it all comes down to it Wings played like The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit I picked the Leafs to win Game on emotion and adrenalin but the Wings have no excuses for Game They should be the superior The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting for putting his stick in somebody's That was the most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows he's an asshole when it comes to Four lousy Bullshit Murray should send the tape Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out of
