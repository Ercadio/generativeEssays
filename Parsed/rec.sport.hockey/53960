From Subject Re Flyers Re This year's biggest and worst opinion In article writes So in other words if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision Come on Joe think about what you're saying Who they played is VERY Why they played them is what's A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two A low GAA is better then a higher A low GAA against good teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two Let's start I'm not arguing about who is the better I'd take Soderstrom right What I am saying is that Roussel can be a The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are And with that I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this You say Soderstrom played against better That may very well be but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those Besides against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against San The same for Roussel in the Ranger Two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other If you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in It's just my opinion but I think he's got what it Of course I thought that about Mark LaForest But I never did about Wendell So I'm batting in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall As for the Rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you But Rou had his leg in position to make the If he didn't it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or It would have been a On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat But if you were to look at the tie against the Habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that THAT was a goalie in Roussel doesn't have a game like that in I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two time defending And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed Mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the Or there'd never be Anyway I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it Besides with the current game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season Joe Dakes AT T Microelectronics Union Boulevard Allentown PA LET'S GO FLYERS jmd
