from daryl turner subject jets canucks jets hold on, win teemu selanne had goals, keith tkachuk had one, and luciano borsato
scored a rare jets shorthanded goal as the jets held on to beat the
canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1. trevor linden and pavel
bure had two goals each for the canucks in a losing cause. selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay
goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from darrin shannon. hard work paid off tonight for the jets, and if the jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (i woofed
last year when we were up 3-1...i ain't going to do that again. i'll
have to be quietly happy with a solid performance. ;) daryl turner : r.s.h contact for the winnipeg jets internet: fidonet: 1:348/701 -or- 1:348/4 (please route through 348/700)
