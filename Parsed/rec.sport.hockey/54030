From KING COBRA Subject Re ESPN In article A Susan Dart writes If ESPN pisses you off, call them they do respond to calls Last night I called when they said they were cutting to baseball and we couldn't see the sudden death overtime for the BUffalo game Apparently they received enough calls so they waited for the overtime to finish before cutting away Their phone number is Susan Dart Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job But what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid baseball news which is not important at all Then I waited for the scores to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and football Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid basketball Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that was like sec I think they should give more attention to NHl during the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN Hope things improve by next season COBRA
