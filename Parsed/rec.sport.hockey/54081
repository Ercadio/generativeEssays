From Mark Shneyder Subject Re ABC coverage In article Antonio Pera writes I loved the ABC The production was The appearance Antonio you weren't ABC ratings were very I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the National rating came out to a very respectable Top Nielsen markets were at In Boston the game scored lower at but it had some competion from local sports Quite frankly I expected ABC's ratings to be under But I'm happy to be proven wrong Well it pays off clicking away on your cable tv remote And if you happen to be a hockey fan you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey ESPN picked up Detroit Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station WATE for intermission Maybe ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck Good move ESPN PPV Mark
