lost in a Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his and goals of the season which tied the game at in the period and in the Tommy Soderstrom stopped of shots on goal to improve his own record to as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all Roster move Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey Shawn Cronin was a healthy Lines Eklund Lindros Recchi Beranek Brind'Amour Dineen Lomakin Butsayev Conroy Faust Acton Brown Galley Bowen Yushkevich Hawgood Carkner McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary Say if anybody from Buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems We had to turn down the volume The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only shots in the first They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up shots in the last two Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric way up on his Eric dropped it to Galley and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the Mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik skated around him and in on Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick Recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a FLYERS lead at It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further The game then became a defensive struggle for a The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS LaFontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power Mogilny got a post after it was The consecutive penalty kill for the Keith Carney took a holding penalty at for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at to give the Sabres another power play but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the Shots were Buffalo after the FLYERS had led at one Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not This was considered a rebuilding year after The Trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season When asked if he agonized over The Trade he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the But yes there was some agonizing and they'd do it all over When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the He feels that they're years away from a shot at the He expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the He's very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding Happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at of the The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started but eventually Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left He half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the Fuhr didn't know where it was though and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at Then Mogilny on a He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on He went with the backhander but Soderstrom was all over The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at The Sabres coudln't get Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other It started out a on but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a on and back off the Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it FLYERS at That was all for Fuhr John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take But the Sabres still had lots of power play Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over Boos began to ring through the But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block Mistake he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A the rebound or B Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the Well the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom and mistake Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck With the goal at two streaks end for the of shutout hockey and straight penalty Lindros put them right back on the power play at with a high sticking minor I think it was Barnaby This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldn't get too much quality on The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play Things evetually settled down but then the other very bad McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a The gloves were dropped and McGill started pounding the crap out of But during the fight he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match for slashing fighting and for the major minutes of power play time for the Sabres at Barnaby only got The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do After a couple of good Sabre chances Audette handed to Ledyard at the point and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men Wood just slid it into the empty net at to close the FLYERS lead to LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone but Hasek was Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue Another mini breakaway for Mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at for his of the Ironically the youth hockey tip between the and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off That was all in the shots were Into the period and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead A on Acton with the puck he dropped to Eklund in the slot and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot When he finally did shoot he hit the far That was still during the carryover power play Than an incredible almost Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom goes down Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the Red light comes on horn sounds crowd But up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be Well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at The FLYERS could not get anything going at They finally got set up way through but were kept on the As time ran out Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to Dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at Hasek and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his at But the Sabres came right LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS Erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the Mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through Soderstrom's hole for his at to tie the game at Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone and stayed Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it and Rod got the He backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a FLYERS lead at hat trick of the season for Dineen of his career shorthanded goal of the game for him of the Then Carney took a tripping penalty at to kill the rest of the Sabres power Not much action on the on and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle and Dineen found Acton at the right of He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his of the season at on his That was all the scoring shots were Buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of Kevin Dineen has a career high point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but I don't think so The FLYERS longest winning streak in years goals for only against with three Eric Lindros is in league with even strength goals despite missing games with points out of clinched place since the Rangers lose the tie A couple misc notes Forget the Mike Keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award but I failed to mention that the award is for the best The Times of Trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next His response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him FLYERS team record watch Eric Lindros goals assists points rookie records club record goals club record points Eric
