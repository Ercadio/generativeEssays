From Subject FLYERS notes The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious Injuries Pelle Eklund is day to day with a bruised Roster Moves Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round overall of the entry years old ' In games with the tri city Americans he had goals assists and He plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as Andre Faust was returned to He actually left after the second period of the Kings game flew to Albany got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win and played again for Hershey Sunday Lines Fedyk Lindros Recchi Beranek Brind'Amour Dineen Lomakin Butsayev Conroy Acton Brown Galley McGill Yushkevich Cronin Carkner Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in Acton replaced Lomakin in the Game Summary If the FLYERS played like this every night they'd be in the playoffs this The FLYERS hit everything that They created scoring chance after scoring They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal but Puppa made a great save reading the Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at The FLYERS lowly ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every After the power play the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse who were wrestling in the Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a FLYERS lead at The FLYERS kept the pressure on and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a Eventually things settled down and defense Each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were Bowen started giving some Lindros like checks in his own Then Lindros who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the He had Foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards and Mike Mister McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive for a change on the With time running out in the period Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi but then Clark checked Recchi off the Macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the He drove it from just inside the blue Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at Shots were FLYERS in the The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive During the power play the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other As time was running out in the advantage Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle and Eric one timed past Puppa at With the assist Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's season the second best one season total for a FLYER at Eric moves up to all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at to give the FLYERS another chance on the power Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at Not much happened on the on although the Leafs had most of the The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power Tempers flared a little at Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors Keith Acton got a bloody Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at to set up a on The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play led by Dimitri Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his He had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net but Soderstrom stoned The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't get anything Shots were The FLYERS were content with the goal lead in the third period and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of the period but couldn't get past Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them and tempers each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for Glenn Anderson and McGill roughing all at Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at on Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power At about the minute mark Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through The puck was rolling on it's side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at to give the Leafs another chance on the power On the advantage after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his They kept the pressure on but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at No punches thrown Recchi got the initial minor Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing At Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing to set up another on Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's The FLYERS were not happy with that at Al Conroy paired up with Berehowski and started throwing Well Al held his own much to the delight of the Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and Al got a standing O Penalties Eastwood cross check game Clark Carkner Berehowski and Conroy each fighting at So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the The had no interest in stting on the Hawgood Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at That was all the fireworks Tommy Soderstrom would not face another Puppa did but kept the FLYERS off the FLYERS shots were FLYERS in the Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star Shutout number for Soderstrom all since Tied for most in the NHL but he's played fewer games than Belfour or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official FLYERS up to points on the season in Last year they had points in games under so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is better than under in Tragic number holds at points with games The tragic number for is points I watched the Rangers blow a third period lead at home to lose before I finished this Why points instead of Well the FLYERS will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils the Pens twice the FLYERS and finish up with games against the So I guess place could be the goal for the team to focus FLYERS team record watch Eric Lindros goals assists points rookie records club record goals club record points Eric Lindros Dave
