From Randy Graca Subject Re Wings will win gballent Greg Ballentine writes In article Brian Down writes stuff deleted For example look at Pat Quinn of the Canucks I am not saying that he is the best GM merely a better one than Murray and one I am very familiar with He traded Garth Butcher a good player and Dan Quinn not in the NHL anymore to St Louis for Cliff Ronning Geoff Courtnall Sergio Mommesso and Robert Dirk too good to be true right I think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post namely Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM in This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for Louis and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy We can give Quinn credit for being an opportunist stuff about other trades deleted Plus his team has improved a much greater amount than Detroit since he took over with How do you figure Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year They both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less Specifically if I remember correctly third place teams How does this make Vancouver more improved Further if I'm not mistaken the Wings had more points than Vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many Gregmeister Randy
