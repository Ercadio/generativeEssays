From Deepak Chhabra Subject Superstars and attendance was Teemu Selanne was leaders Dean Falcione posting from jrmst writes I wrote When the Pens got Mario granted there was big publicity etc etc and interest was immediately Gretzky did the same thing for However imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in attendance if the team record did not In the year before Lemieux came Pittsburgh finished with Following his arrival the Pens finished with and points with a couple of Stanley Cups thrown It was at this point the Pens attendance was near capacity out of sellouts yet they hadn't made the playoffs since How do you explain a place team breaking attendance records when they haven't been to the playoffs in years Mario Lemieux is the explanation You could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that would make the playoffs is the Funny you should mention is exactly the case I was going to But I think the reason is Lemieux had a point season and was the first non Gretzky to win the Hart and Ross since People turned out to watch him I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support If they suddenly dropped to say points you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the Also the following year the Pens had points not My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing this Coffey late in and before they even had a playoff bound A doubling of attendance occured in from the previous An increase from points to points is not going to do The arrival of Mario Lemieux is what did You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Was it gee Mario Lemieux is amazing I'll go watch him play or was it gee now we've got a kick ass guy on our side I'll go watch him play I think it was the Similar thing happened in Before Gretzky's arrival about per After constant They are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement since Gretzky's first year How do you explain it People are going to see they certainly aren't going to see a winner they haven't GOT a They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than they currently have yet they didn't draw as well I don't think this is The tickets sell but people don't go to the I think this thread has already been ticket holders in LA don't always use their So in effect after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival to points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall Anyway McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales But as I said when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky the player can transcend winning as the major drawing For the short term Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky simply because they make people around them But winning sure as hell Well at least we are in full agreement here This does not make Roger's point any more valid but the Jets aren't So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point couldn't getting a HUGE jump in productivity yet they ARE getting a huge jump in This is due to the emergence of Teemu They have the best record in hockey it sure as hell isn't because they are Yes but they are doing no worse than last I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg It's difficult to predict but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels I seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL If that's the case then fair enough but if it isn't the case then I'm curious to hear your
