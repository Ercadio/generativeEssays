From thomas galvin Subject Re In article Keith Keller writes In article swartzjh writes Does anyone have the games ESPN will be airing this week Hopefully the Detroit Toronto game I though ABC did a decent job by getting some F king NO hockey games televised nationally tonight What the hell is this Why the hell is ESPN showing some stupid baseball game when baseball is not even three weeks into the season and hockey is in the playoffs No wait I know the answer But still It really pisses me off to no They better start putting some more f cking games on or they will never make any money off of the deal that brought hockey back to AARGH not that I'd watch anyway but hockey needs all the publicity it can get Keith Keller LET'S GO RANGERS LET'S GO QUAKERS IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS A cow is not a vegetarian Keith Keller You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this one plus year The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last Minnesota game and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at They must honor the previous deals they does have something to do with it especially if you risk a lawsuit for breach of contract with So I'm I don't get SportsChannel anyway Tom Galvin
