From Roger Maynard Subject Re hawks vs leafs lastnight In Gerald Olchowy writes In article Raj Ramnarace writes did anyone else see this game last night just like a playoff game lots of I was disappointed by the video goal on all replays joe murphy's goal shouldn't have counted it didn't go in net and according to the tsn broadcasters the video goal judge said that he saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the puck went in this is crap like this doesn't occur in the playoffs the game would have ended in tie I thought the red light went in the review the presumption would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the the replays I say even from the rear the evidence wasn't conclusive that the puck was in or my It seemed pretty conclusive to The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the And the announcers admittedly homers kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs because it was obvious to them and I would have thought to anyone who saw the replay that the puck didn't go The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact This to me is unheard Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the Leaf chances this cordially as always rm Roger Maynard
