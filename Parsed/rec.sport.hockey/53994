From Ron Morris Subject Re WJR in Boston John Girash For all those Red Wings fans in Boston I thought I'd letcha know that being desperate for news on the game I tried to get WJR AM on my Walkman and SUCCEEDED It was at night about reception got better as it got You can get WJR a LONG way The problem is that because of those well known and beloved contractual obligations WJR will be doing Tiger baseball instead of the Wings playoff games for probably half the games the Wings could For this series I know tonight's game and I believe games and if necessay will be Ron And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry I'm getting bored reading the same problems in the paper decade after I want people to have to deal with new President Bill Clinton
