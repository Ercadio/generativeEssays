From Daryl Turner Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL In article Richard John Rauser writes Here's the point there are far too many Europeans in the I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team let's say the Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and Borshevshky Is this North America or isn't it Toronto Detriot Quebec and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as Gee you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list what with regulars being I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the Russian Rocket I will completely throw As it is now every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a By the way I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with Well being a Jet fan I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly Nothing serious just enough to keep him out of a Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who aren't even better hockey It's all This European mystique is sickening but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own In most cases the owners have very little to do with They give their general managers one order when it comes to the me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Whether that player is in Kindersley Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk Russia if the GM believes him to be the better player the GM should be drafting Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league when referring to Canadian It doesn't belong to them it belongs to the The owners can do what they While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL sorry for the football reference didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions in most cases would make players better Oh yeah and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America While there are some that play in the AHL or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL the ECHL or on the secondary farm teams in the the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton but I don't believe there are any Europeans in So with all those teams there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly only getting I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own I just don't want them on I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team and some of those players were the among the best in the From Hedberg Nilsson and Sjoberg to Sel nne Zhamnov and Olausson and all those in between and to come I wouldn't have it any other Daryl Turner contact for the Winnipeg Jets Internet FidoNET or please route through Tkachuk over to Zhamnov up to Sel nne he shoots he scores The Jets win the Cup The Jets win the Cup Essensa for Vezina Housley for Norris Sel nne for Calder
