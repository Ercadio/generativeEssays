From kirchner Robert Kirchner Subject Re German audience is lunatic In article Jouko Kylmaoja writes I watched the game Germany Czechs in WC i was astonished about the behaviour of the German audience The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went It was not just those Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't call on the Czechs right before their first grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the Isostar bros gave the German team a penalty for that but it didn't help I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi Kill 'em All Everyone Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude when some people throw coins on the ice Hey I don't approve the behavior of these guys especially not in a WC game but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi' in this But Us Germans Sucks just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem remember the world cup in Italy Again there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop windows or fighting with other so called 'fans' who come to a WC just to see if the Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best Which other sports are you talking about I don't think soccer is 'every possible sport' It really pisses me off I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but most of them seem to How many Germans do you know Do you think out of is 'most of them' If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US what do you think about the Americans 'Most of them' like beating blacks Jokke Kylmaoja Robert
