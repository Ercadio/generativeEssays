From Anna Matyas Subject Re ABC coverage Gerald Olchowy writes Clement although he has a pleasant personality aggravatingly pleasant in my opinion is a terrible analyst because he is almost alway prototypical example being New Jersey's first goal last I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny knew did Irvin Dick Irvin was a friend of Clement you aren't any Dick As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or the New York Rangers I'd take John Davidson over Bill Clement any Personality means something to That is exactly why I like Clement and Emrick On the other hand JD is a pompous bull headed arrogant know it He's a real turn off which is exactly what I do when he's on One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks too If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball
