From thomas galvin Subject Re Bay area media Wings Leafs coverage In article Roland Dreier writes The San Francisco Bay area media is reporting tonight that the Detroit Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs Can someone who is not part of the media conspiracy against the Leafs tell me how the game really went I am expecting a win for the Leafs shutout for Potvin hat trick for Andreychuk and a goal and assists for Gilmour If the Leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever biased ref was at the game have to call against the Leafs to let the Red Wings win Thank you very Roland Dreier Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the I watched most of the game on ESPN as soon as I realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second The Maple Leafs were Very Meanwhile the Red Wings were skating very freely and dictating the pace of the I didn't detect any bad penalty calls Van Hellemond did his usual good job Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff game in a few years For the Leafs sake I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies for game If game is indicative of the series it's gonna go Tom Galvin
