From Mark Shneyder Subject Re Radio stations Add Boston's WEEI AM as the Bruins' flagship station You probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a , watt station The Bruins also have network stations in all New England states This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an all sports radio station The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station WMEX AM whenever there is a the same night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics This happened times during the course of the regular season The Celtics own financially troubled WEEI The Bruins might resurface on WHDH next year Stay tuned PPV Mark
