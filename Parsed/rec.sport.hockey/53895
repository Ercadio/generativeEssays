From Kevin Stamber Subject ESPN the network with a Dale Hunter ties the game scoring his third goal of the game with seconds remaining in You could feel it coming Due to contractual agreements ESPN will be unable to carry the rest of this game live so that we may show you a worthless early season battle between those two pennant contenders the Cleveland Indians and the California When the winning goal is scored we WILL do the grave injustice of breaking into the baseball game something reserved only for the deaths of Presidents or the trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs to show you the goal on instant Aren't you SO lucky to have national coverage of hockey It's HEIDI all over again dammit Kevin Stamber Purdue University PENGUINS DEVILS ROLL TRAIN ROLL
