>whatta weird town!!!!! --minnesota definitely deserves an nhl franchise!!! you'll see the
minnesota whalers pretty soon, so fear not minnesota fans. no norm green,
'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!) --what a difference two years makes! minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992
and made the finals. they finish with a better record at 38-38-10 thi year
and move to dallas. every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!!
finally!!! it's about time, nhl!!!
