From Gerald Olchowy Subject Re ABC coverage In article Anna Matyas writes Thorne is good and I've always been a fan of Clement but I miss Mike Emrick My boyfriend who is not a hockey fan even looked up at one point and said These guys are pretty good This is the same guy who said that Rick Tocchet looks like Charles Clement although he has a pleasant personality aggravatingly pleasant in my opinion is a terrible analyst because he is almost alway prototypical example being New Jersey's first goal last I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny knew did Irvin Dick Irvin was a friend of Clement you aren't any Dick As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or the New York Rangers I'd take John Davidson over Bill Clement any Gerald
