From Mamatha Devineni Ratnam Subject Real FAns There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they That's Anyone who would follow the Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home But to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the When I visit PIttsburgh I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn't sign Barry Lert's say the Pens start doing to their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have done in recent years I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the I'll still follow it and bitch about But I won't waste my money on mediocre P ravin Ratnam
