From Deepak Chhabra Subject Re Habs Late In article APR VM MCGILL CA CCDB CCDB MUSICA MCGILL CA writes Quebec dominated Habs for first periods and only Roy kept this one from being rout, although he did blow nd goal Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump pull back most of the time Do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge A dominant defenceman would be nice too bad Schneider got hurt He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes Speaking of Chelios, I wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade I also wish we still had Corson Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the bench Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck Too bad nobody is in front most of the time Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique gets knocked down It's disgusting We also have Lebeau ' , getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn ' , with no reply from the team, except to yell for a penalty Dammit, Denis Savard threw the best only Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off balance When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's big trouble someplace Hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored could have had , plus another in nd Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head The third period at least provided something to look forward to Habs won the period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at Hopefully they play that way at home Roy made the saves we'll ignore that second goal , so now it's up to the team P S To all those Grant Fuhr doubters Buffalo , Boston 'nuff said And did somebody say Dale Hunter was a playoff choker I'd rethink that position
