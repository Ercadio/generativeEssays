From Robert Angelo Pleshar Subject Re How to beat Pittsburgh from Anna Matyas Now if we could just clone Chelios's personality and transplant it into all of the defensemen on the Islanders Capitals and Gerald In other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of misconducts And this comes from a Chelios Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I That way when one got a penalty the others could kill it Ralph
