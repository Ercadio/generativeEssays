From Pasi Fr nti Subject Re plus minus stat edward lor writes Player Points Subtraction Lemieux LaFontaine Oates Yzerman Selanne This is wrong Among Lemieux's points, we do NOT know how many are power play points We may be able to find out how many PP goal he scored, but not how many PP assist he accumulated We also don't know the times he was on the ice but not credited on the goals the Pens scored That is what my point really was There is not straight dependency between the and scored points Apparently most of the netters have realized it by themselves
