From daniell Daniel Lyddy Subject Re Bruins vs Canadiens In article jack petrilli writes So I don't know what you mean by parity Boston never was is not now and never will be as good an organization as the Montreal Never was Is not now What other valid test can you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner What do you propose a worthless vote like they do in college football What a joke You Boston fans make me laugh you're going crazy based on a very recent Boston domination over Montreal in the I mean how many cups has Boston won compared to Montreal's And who do you think is going to win the next cup between the teams Montreal or Boston You know Sinden's going to find some way of screwing up even this good Boston He'll fire Suter or trade away a vital Admittedly his last few trades have been good ones but how long before his luck runs out and he starts making Esposito for Ratelle type trades again If I remember right Brad Park was also involved in that He wasn't all that bad a hockey But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years for Rick Middleton Rangers I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle ton so I'll call this one a Barry Pederson for Cam Neely Canucks Any questions Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka Oilers Didja see that one Rosie roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs Courtnall Ranford for Andy Moog Oilers A Moog is a good goaltender Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year and Courtnall always seems to get his Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall as a defensive liability Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin Flyers Any more questions Janney Quintal for Adam Oates Blues Janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy the the Bruins play in Adam's Enough said So even if you count the Esposito Vadnais Ratelle Park I don't remember who else Joe Zanussi trade as a double minus Harry the Horse trader comes out on I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry not in spite of BTW do you really think the Habs will bounce back next I'll bet they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference behind any of the following Pittsburgh Quebec Boston Washington Someone correct me if these five teams will not be in Montreal's In summary things look bleak for the Habs at least in the near I suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be that team that Lindros didn't want to play I admit that I've been suffering lately with the Boston gets hot while Montreal swans in the playoffs type But I do have the sure knowledge that the Montreal braintrust will keep plugging away until they hit the right formula for yet another Whereas if I were a Boston fan I'd have this kind of despair that as long as Harry Sinden is running the show the Bruins will always be good but never good Jack Dan Lyddy University of California at Berkeley My Two Favorite Hockey Teams The Boston Bruins Whoever's playing Pittsburgh
