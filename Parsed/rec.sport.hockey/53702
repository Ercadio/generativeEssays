From James David Subject Plus minus stat Post of Newsgroups From Roger Maynard Subject Re Plus minus stat Organization of Computer Science Laurentian University Sudbury ON Date Fri Apr GMT discussion deleted Good for You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his Roger I'm not sure here but I think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go 's if it makes you feel To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is Your hockey education is not my MY HOCKEY EDUCATION What the f are you talking about I'm not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane My word such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Why does he bother you so was an effective player for his style of He was just another To laud him as anything more I find I hated the I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever skate in my Why would anyone talk about Gainey I hate the Habs sound like a year This statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about Don't give me this crap about cogent arguments 've yet to read something of yours that is You consistently argue with emotion huge sweeping statements Frankly you have a very unconvincing I'm not defending Bob I don't care for him all that But your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is has no basis in How many Calders did he win I think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory What about the Conn Smythe Was that a fluke Yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar I know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him go Who would you rather have as your checking centre Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my checking Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey I'm really sorry Roger but you have lost me completely Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ himself in nets Did he play hockey at a high level Was he any good If not why would you bother to bring JC up I am talking about hockey players If you can't follow the conversation don't follow As I said previously it is not my responsibility to educate Hey cowboy You're the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of Gainey with Gretzky and figure it Now if you were to compare say for example Bob Gainey with Guy Carbonneau you would have a balanced Two Big Neither one of them is worth How many individual awards between them don't remember once again please feel free to refresh my try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education I'm wrong let's was I wrong in the I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the OH MY GOD Did I say that 's your point Fuhr is a goaltender goaltender's don't plug his prime he was one of the Sanderson was a you stick him on you may as well include half the Flyers team of the same first place I'm only guessing here Rog but I have a feeling that you've setup a You're wrong again macro key on your That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or Greg's postings then I will be sure to implement that very Oh Roger you shouldn' I don't deserve are far too accomodating I would suggest that your comment And when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the Grant Fuhr Essa Tikkannen Butch Goring Bob Nystrom Bob Gainey Doug Jarvis Derek Sanderson Wayne Cashman Bob Baun Bob Pulford Ralph Backstrom Henri Richard Dick so demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the yes settle has claimed that they are hockey Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a hockey And Greg ate it And that is what this thread is all If you didn't know that then why are you responding You seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous 's If you want to debate Gainey go why bring up everybody else How does it support your argument Do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us And as for blanket disregard for these individuals I can remember Leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four Stanley No one ran around telling us that George Armstrong was the best hockey player in the I couldn't agree The Flyers won two cups for the same So what I don't get Are you angry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition You seem to think these pluggers are hyped don't and If you're last statement is some sort of compromise fair You might consider developing your own After all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I am quite sure that flattery is not your C' has a nice ring to admit it you had a good I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were a complete Not a pleasant bone in your body eh Rog Why are you so unhappy Not getting invited to enough parties What In the future if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would Roger why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour You really should sounds a little bit Frankly it's about as honourable as a good congenially as always jd James David s James David
