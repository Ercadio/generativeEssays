From Roger Maynard Subject Re Canadiens another Stanley Cup In Richard John Rauser writes pereira CAM ORG Dean Pereira writes With the kind of team Montreal has now, they can take the cup easily The only problem they have right now is that everyone is trying to steal the show and play alone They need some massive teamwork This is known as the Savard syndrome and we are talking Denis, not Serge No team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup They are also in a little of a slump because long time hockey Montreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for years But I know that is no excuse But if the Habs manage to get some good teamwork and get into the spirit, they should have no problem winning in May They could tell Savard to stay home and watch the games on TV I agree I also think Roy needs a good kick sometimes that horrible loss to the Capitals last week yeeeech Here's to Cup this year Sounds like to me cordially, as always, rm Roger Maynard
