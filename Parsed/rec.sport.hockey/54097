From mre Mike Eisler Subject Re SHARKS Jack Feirerra was Re SHARKS Kingston Fired In article CSD nlu Nelson Lu writes In article mre Mike Eisler writes I don't think trading Kisio was intrinsically a mistake however trading him for a round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a round pick for a playoff In fact I would intimate that the offers the Sharks got this year for Kisio were way greater than just a round Hindsight's Nobody expected Kisio to have his best career Besides without Kisio the Sharks would have tanked even earlier in the season and Gund might have gotten a little more serious about getting Joe Murphy a guy who definitely would be around years from now when the Sharks do make the What else could be done The Gunds offered million for Murphy but the Oilers wanted prospect s which the Sharks declined to give which I think is I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't Gund's offer was the right but too late in the offered in November lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy this season and make the playoffs this in March doesn't help Sather with his immediate objectives doesn't help with long term objectives only a prospect or draft pick does and no way should the Sharks do that However getting back to what if games had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year then the Sharks go for October and maybe Gund panicks sooner in And here's another what if twist Chicago would have had Kisio this season they never go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his best season bigger guys in Chicago So Gund has no So Ferriera Sather and Keenan all look like A broken fax machine and Ferriera Keenan and maybe Kingston and maybe even Green lose their Kind of makes you shiver doesn't Bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for Kisio leaving I can concoct an equally bright If the Kisio fiasco was the cause of Ferierra's down fall I hope it wasn't because he tried to trade Kisio but because he screwed it Nonetheless I'm sorry Ferierra and Kingston are gone and I wish Gund would And what have the Gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were gone Are you serious Let Ferierra go fire Kingston these last two basically mean that Sharks are starting over again in terms of the timetable to capture the As I've stated frequently out expansion teams had the same GM from inception through Cup season broadcast more home games than away games broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games jack up my ticket prices from to in two years not that I'm going to pay bucks for I'll probably next to the virtual folks not tell me my priority not let me sell my priority in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets for next season before I get to select my section not let me park at the new arena after paying for their privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when I got there for straight I've been a loyal ticket holder since day literally in spring of ' when the team was and I'm not getting that loyalty Wirtz treats his fans far better by And Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of GO EDMONTON OILERS Go for playoffs next year Stay in Edmonton I know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures but what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the Stay in Edmonton part I'd never wish the Kings to leave metro LA it's too much fun watching the Shark's beat Mike Eisler mre Not only are they Leafs the best team but their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh' Their players are mighty bright I mean he really was going to get his wallet back right '' Jan Brittenson on Leaf Pen woofers in
