From Chuq Von Rospach Subject Re NHL Draft SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes As for the picks Ottawa picks which means it is almost that Alexander Daigle will go He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or I dunno about I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked and after coming back from his second multi game suspension for being stupid he's really tanked in his His stock is dropping like a Also remember that a lot of teh draft stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of It's not clear that Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current He's still first round but I don't consider him a first pick lock by any means at this It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos IMO I would take He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Daigle didn't show this for his junior San Jose will then get Kariya won't go in the first three for a very simple reason he's not leaving college and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that Kariya could go or unless a team can convince him to leave school early which I doubt My cut on things as they stand today Draft Order Ottawa Daigle if not Pronger San Jose Niedermayer unless Ottawa skips Then it's it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for I don't believe they draft him to keep him Tampa Bay whoever Ottawa doesn't take or maybe Koslov Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support Training DAL AUX Member SFWA Editor OtherRealms GEnie ALink CHUQ Minor League fans San Jose Giants A San Francisco Giants fans The Stick NOT San Jose Sharks fans New seat TBD
