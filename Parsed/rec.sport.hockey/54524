From Brett Ball Subject Re Ranger Fans In article writes I for one am happy about the Ranger's hiring of It's too bad that they didn't hire him when Smith fired Nielsen maybe he could of staightened out the babies on this team and made the What this team needs is a little fire under their butts Reading through most of these hockey news I don't see many Ranger fans I'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering Ranger But remember suffering builds character I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last dreadful Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didn't we see Mike Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first went down Why is Joe Kocur playing every night He is not Bob Probert who is tough but also can How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the At least he plays with some heart and character draws penalties and plays when he's on the Was he in the doghouse for some reason Joe Cirella Enough said Ranger fans may be suffering but we're some of the most loyal unlike Islander fans who only show up when the team As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think there's only one team that can test Pittsburgh and that's This would be the most entertaining and hard fought Mario is amazing Kurt I think Joe Kocus should play every He is a big physical guy and he gets the fans into the game with some big both checks and fists Its a big advantage to get the crowd Plus he helps protect the other Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is on the ice unless he is I have seen people start to go after essa Tikkanen only to go slinking away when Kocur steps I think he is big asset but should be third line and special situation only
