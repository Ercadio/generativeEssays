From Jonathan Barrett Subject Re This year's biggest and worst opinion I can only comment on the Kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but he's clearly much more than Great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate In fact he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin But at best he's only a mediocre A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a Other than that the award goes to Robert Lang an uninspiring Robitaille could easily be MVP but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Jon
