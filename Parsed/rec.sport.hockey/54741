From Susan Clark Subject Re Leafs What happened Hi What happened Potvin didn't let six goals Wendel and Andreychuk woke Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs the emotional Refs calls especially last night tended to favour A couple of comments On Gilmour Just because the guy isn't one of the three stars doesn't mean he was not leading the Someone posted the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth he walked away with the Molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular On the officiating I've heard gripes from both ends on this Emotions are very high in this series the rivalry is one of the stronger ones I know I do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro Leaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on Gilmour's hand In general I STILL think Detroit has one of the better chances Pittsburgh though I think the Leafs would do better against the not as well if they made it out of the division Problem is I like both these teams though I'm supporting the Leafs on the underdog D By the tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not playing aggressive By the 'm not any sort of expert nor do I claim to I just like watching a good tee hee Susan
