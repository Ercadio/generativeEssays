From gballent Greg Ballentine Subject Re Wings will win In article Randy Graca writes I also think that they will have a hard time with Pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the Detroit sportswriters are predicting Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM I have ever seen in hockey How do you figure that When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley A good GM like Murray can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray way too many to Murray isn't even the best GM in the league He fails in comparison to Sinden Sather Savard Caron Fletcher and Quinn in my I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey unless they have seen VERY few GM' Gregmeister
