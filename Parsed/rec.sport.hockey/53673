From FRANK MICHAE SALVATORE Subject Re Patrick Division Correction In article Robbie Po RAP writes Well I was a little off in those predictions One I didn't count on the Devils scoring goals tonight in a tie hence there goes the streak Secondly I didn't count on the Islanders getting just point out of against the Whalers in two So no more Isles New predicitons PENGUINS VS ISLANDERS Penguins in or CAPITALS VS DEVILS Devils in Why should we pay your predictions any heed considering you couldn't even predict the proper matchups Maybe you should try forecasting the weather Frank Salvatore
