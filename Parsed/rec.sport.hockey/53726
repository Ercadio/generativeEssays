From Petteri Kortelainen Subject Re New Finnish Star is born In article A writes I saw yesterday on TV a game between Team Sweden and Team Finland Most of us might know that it was played in Stockholm and the result was for the home team That's nothing very special But I was very surprised of Saku Koivu I must admit that he surprised me already in the Finnish playoffs And now on team Finland Saku Koivu is a light weight player, if we consider his size According to my stats he is only cm and kgs And he is only But he is a real two way player Skates well, can score, gives nice passes, does even bodycheckings He is really something to watch in the WC The size isn't always everything Maybe we remember Harlamov And they say that Saku is still growing up cm during last year Saku isn't that small any longer I guess I heard he is cm tall at the moment and will still grow cm Petteri Kortelainen
