From Subject Leafs win thank you Potvin It's about time the boys got it together They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear or is that high gear in game Except for a minute stretch in the nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true I have to admit that goaltending was the key Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the nd He also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost Cheveldae goals Clark even looked like he had stopped moping first star , although I still don't know why he was so flat in games and If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game , they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance, but a chance I'm no RM where is he anyways haha Barfly
