From Jon Shaib Subject Some Play offs Thoughts Well we're almost halfway through the first round and so far things are good in general The teams that I hate most Chicago and Basten are down even though there is a possibility either can still win their series yet this ego thrashing and arrogance smashing by the underdogs Louis and Buffalo is so rewarding Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good enough to go all the way yet too good to be able to get some really good draft Is it just me or does anyone out there also think that this year the cup final should be played between teams from the WALES Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques arrogant 's or are they really Smythe what I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel night in and night We should see some Canucks Jets Flames Don Cherry is an alright but so are our ObLeafsJoke what do you get when you cross a maple leaf and a groundhog Six more weeks of crummy hockey GO HABS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Jon Shaib
