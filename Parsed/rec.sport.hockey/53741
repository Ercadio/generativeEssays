From Steve Gallichio Subject Re NHL Team Captains Anna Matyas wrote Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to Pittsburgh In what still IMHO ranks as the all time greatest PR blunder not to mention on ice blunder the Whalers ever committed GM Eddie Johnston and Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped him of the Captain's C in December of The whole organization read EJ and Ley and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind sided by EJ dumped on Francis all season starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract publicly humiliating him stripping him of the C and then trading him that Spring to the Classy guy that The loss of Francis and too a lesser extent Ulf was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in Gratuitous good EJ did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek Cassels Sanderson Poulin Nylander He stripped the roster but he DID lay a SG a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder
