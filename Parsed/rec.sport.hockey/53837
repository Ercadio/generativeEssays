From Robert Andolina Subject minnesota scene To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota From what I have seen in the local news TV and newspaper various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey A columnist for the Paul Pioneer Press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the Twin First the sites Target Center Civic Center Paul and yes even the Met The columnist was pretty confident that Minnesota will get a team and that the Target Center will ultimately win He argued however that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process Without the inter site competition the columnist sorry I can't remember his name believes that Minnesota would have a team by the Also because of the situation with the Timberwolves things will be delayed until unless the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target However they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for conventions and short term events even with hockey at Target To add to this mess a STUDY to months is going to be conducted on the future viability of the Met Center which obviously delays the process even I hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging Minneapolis to take over the Target Center The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met which may Regarding possible candidates the three teams are Hartford Tampa Bay and New I would prefer the Devils Minnesota Ice Demons although the Lightning may have Although it hasn't been announced yet it looks like neutral site games will be played at the Target Center next Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible and I wouldn't be surprised to see Hartford and Tampa show up there So Minnesota may end up getting another team but it may take a few Go Sabres Robert Andolina former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis
