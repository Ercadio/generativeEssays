From Gerald Olchowy Subject Re Wings will win In article Randy Graca writes Gerald Olchowy writes Bryan Murray has done very little as Fedorov Cheveldae Chaisson the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous has made a couple of decent 's about that would hardly rank him as the best There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian The whole Russian strategy is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano who was GM before What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory Murray Craven who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving Also it's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team but the quality of Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid even if Federko used to be a great player at one Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage with those that didn't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved such as Troy Crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy than anyone was the first GM to waste high draft choices on young would still be GM but he succombed to Demers pleading to make the Oates Federko et al is the deal that sealed his Murray has made some decent these are more due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on his was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they essentially gave him Carson was really a big anchor to the team and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul Coffey for If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available and he was unable to pull the It is his judgement that he has enough with what he's doesn't have that many more years in his Gerald
