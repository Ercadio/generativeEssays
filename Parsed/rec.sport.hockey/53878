From SHAWN LUDDINGTON Subject Re NHL Draft In article Jon Carr writes When is the draft this year And will there be any coverage I know the upcomming NFL draft is on Anyone got the details Paul Kariya Pick perhaps He won't last long I don't know the exact coverage in the In Canada it is covered by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage I don't know As for the picks Ottawa picks which means it is almost that Alexander Daigle will go He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or IMO I would take He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Daigle didn't show this for his junior San Jose will then get Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the blue chip prospects Chris Gratton Chris Pridham a swedish player who I can't remember his name Draft Order Ottawa San Jose Tampa Bay South Florida or Anahiem South Florida or Anahiem Hartford Edmonton Dallas NY Rangers Philadelphia the thru picks could be wrong I don't have the standings here and am guessing In my mind there are top notch prospects in the draft with Kariya leading the way but not going Shawn GO CAPS two first round picks for the next three years THANKS or should I say RON CARON and SCOTT STEVENS
