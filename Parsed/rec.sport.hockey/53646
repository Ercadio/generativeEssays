From Mamatha Devineni Ratnam Subject Atlanta Hockey Hell Well it's not that But I am still pretty pissed of at the local ABC They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at instead of an earlier time I don't even understand their If they didnt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game And if they showed the remaining hours of the game would it hurt to play David Brinkley at its regular time They dont have any decent programming before noon I called the sports dept and blasted them on their I called gain and someone picked it When I asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs he seemed a bit When I explained a bit more in detail he then said that's upto to our programming call back on weel I understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this BUt I can't understand how someone in the sports can't even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works Anyway I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB and ask them not to do the same thing for the next Pravin Ratnam Oh by the way Pens rule
