From Yaska Sankar Subject Re Nords Habs in We was robbed In article Deepak Chhabra writes In article writes Aargh Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased presently in the He called a total of penalties on the Habs and one on the The Nords' penalty came in Stewart being an ex Nordique himself was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with WAS ROBBED Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec Everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc Well the key doesn't quite fit if you're I don't buy this at Roy was the reason the game was and that would not have been the case had Dionne kept his Hextall gave up very questionable goals himself Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to Roy stood on his head for the first minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end to Kamensky's mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces he played very well but the Haller shot off the post in OT the rebound bouncing over Bellows' stick the Brunet breakaway the chances for LeClair all those opportunities were not finished off by Montreal and it cost Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly He even saw the whole shot Sure no excuse but it was just the The timing stank but against an explosive team like Quebec they gave them opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally Montreal played a solid game although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of Schneider will hurt even more I Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole The defense for the time this season played remarkably keeping Sakic Nolan and Sundin out of the slot most of the Normally I would say that any team that blows a goal lead with less than five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective But I don't think this was a team loss although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal This most certainly was a team Leclair missed his opportunities as did Bellows and Dionne took a bad Damphousse and Lebeau were silent Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all Roy gave up the bad Roy by no means can be singled out for this Roy is paid big money to He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies and he still is in the top when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the Demers should start Racicot in the next If not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or maybe this article if The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the They are no better than uninformed Why should they read the papers They played minutes of Burnsian hockey to shut down All they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the extra Red Light to face That's a guaranteed way to end the series Who would be taught a lesson by this The fans the media and Racicot Certainly not the rest of the I didn't think the wrap around was as bad as the second I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender can't remember who in the first But you are correct it shouldn't have gone in If you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an OT then I But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Roy had both the near and far posts covered but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped around the net not a bad goal at Yaska of Electrical Computer Engineering Sankar University of Toronto Toronto Canada
