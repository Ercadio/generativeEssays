From Randy Graca Subject Re Wings will win gballent Greg Ballentine writes In article Randy Graca writes gballent Greg Ballentine writes stuff deleted When Quinn took over Vancouver several years ago NOT LAST YEAR they regularily missed the I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably Quinn has improved the team from non playoff calibre to a serious When Murray took over in Detroit the were about a team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup The last year before Bryan Murray took over the Wings did not make the While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived in his last two years they were respectively embarrassed in the first round by Chicago and then failed to make the playoffs at a time a might add when there were only five teams in the Norris It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot I mean a lot tougher division than the Norris also known as the Snorris Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders eight times a year while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Now Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving so was everybody in the Norris except Louis Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their They had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little For really good players they had Yzerman Burr and Probert and that was about And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good The rest were either very green rookies or washed up The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his Then even his coaching began to So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a Quinn is one example of a better GM than There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as was when Quinn took over some of which I outlined above but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn with the exception of And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender as I'm sure everyone reading this will We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final assuming they don't get knocked out like last year Gregmeister Randy
