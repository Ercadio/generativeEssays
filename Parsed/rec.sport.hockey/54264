From KING COBRA Subject Re ESPN In article Robert Andolina writes The thing that confuses me most about ESPN is that they decided to show the Penguins and Devils again on Thursday night Being that both of the first two games were dominated by Pitt , you would think that they would show a different game This is in addition to the fact that they should show other games just for the sake of fair exposure Also, some of you should know that as far as I can tell ESPN is not going to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds I believe that they are only going to show Campbell games in the first two rounds as those series wear on games , or perhaps games , , Also, does anyone have info on ABC coverage for this Sunday ESPN had an advertise for Pens Devils game I don't know what the hell they are trying to do, especially against NFL draft Well I guess there goes the NHL ratings for Sundays game Robert Andolina
