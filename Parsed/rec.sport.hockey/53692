From James David Subject Plus minus stat Post of Newsgroups From Roger Maynard Subject Re Plus minus Organization of Computer Science Laurentian University Sudbury ON Date Thu Apr GMT In James David writes It was Bryan Trottier not Denis It was a vicious 'boarding' from was given a Perhaps it was It happened behind the Habs goal if I Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the But Roger what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill as a hockey player If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's skills If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise as Gainey was then yeah I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing technically smart In any case to claim as Greg did that Gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely Later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other people's mouths would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one that I along with Greg claim that Gainey never made a technical If you actually read what I've written you will find that I make no such if logic serves me well you're contradicting Gainey was a And when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the Grant Fuhr Essa Tikkannen Butch Goring Bob Nystrom Bob Gainey Doug Jarvis Derek Sanderson Wayne Cashman Bob Baun Bob Pulford Ralph Backstrom Henri Richard Dick so I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the Good for You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his Roger I'm not sure here but I think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go 's if it makes you feel I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at My word such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Why does he bother you so was an effective player for his style of on this I also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey are an integral part of Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any And that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go Who would you rather have as your checking centre Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my checking Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey I'm really sorry Roger but you have lost me completely Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ himself in nets Now if you were to compare say for example Bob Gainey with Guy Carbonneau you would have a balanced any The Selke is designed to acknowledge their think that most people understand that it's not the Nobel settle You're wrong The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best If Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen I'm wrong let's was I wrong in the first place I'm only guessing here Rog but I have a feeling that you've setup a You're wrong again macro key on your I agree that my use of the word plugger is I think you know what I'm getting I would also like to point out that Gilmour's potential as a Selke winner was never part of the you asking me for an opinion If so I think there are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour among the Settle down If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel prize then I suggest that you had best settle down And if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle down before you bother following up on my I would suggest that your comment And when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the Grant Fuhr Essa Tikkannen Butch Goring Bob Nystrom Bob Gainey Doug Jarvis Derek Sanderson Wayne Cashman Bob Baun Bob Pulford Ralph Backstrom Henri Richard Dick so demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the yes settle has claimed that they are hockey congenially as always jd James David You might consider developing your own After all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I am quite sure that flattery is not your C' has a nice ring to admit it you had a good congenially as always jd James David James David Western Business School London Ontario
