From Subject FLYERS notes The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their straight victory a OT winner over the Hartford The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich just his of the season and his first game The FLYERS never led up until that point in the For the Whalers the loss marked an NHL record OT loss this Roster move Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Injuries Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight and was Lines Eklund Lindros Recchi Beranek Brind'Amour Dineen Lomakin Butsayev Conroy Faust Acton Brown Galley Bowen Yushkevich Hawgood Carkner Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary I didn't get TV coverage of the game and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up First Period Hartford Nylander Philadelphia Recchi Lindros Brind'Amour pp Penalties Verbeek Har holding Carkner Phi roughing Houda Har interference Second Period Hartford Burt Cunneyworth Kron

Phi holding Overtime Philadelphia Yushkevich Faust Penalties None Power Play Philadelphia of Hartford of Goalies Philadelphia Roussel shots saves Hartford Lenarduzzi On the first Hartford goal Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took The Recchi goal was a on with The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS Take the body and if they get one shot and beat you Don't give them another Carkner Galley and McGill are all terrible about this I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the That's all I have my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored much less From what I heard Roussel had a very strong After the game Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the It was Garry Galley for his career high point total I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play Tommy Soderstrom for his team record tying shutouts in only about a season and Mark Recchi for his all time high team single season scoring But here's the odd He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number If he picks Recchi as after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros doesn't that make Lindros What You wanna know my three stars of the season Well since you Eric Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next Tommy shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios booo in front of He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if Roussel complains again about being number look for him to be traded within Mark Again you can't argue with an all time team high single season scoring There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many Plus Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire Not a tough Honorable mentions Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing Then again he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent Yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to Garry Galley was the team's point leader from Again there are some things you just can't argue And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors But his defensive play often negates his offensive A little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point But consistency became a problem for A couple
