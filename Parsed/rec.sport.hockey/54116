From Subject ESPN cares less about hockey ESPN is pathetic I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage and I agree with all of Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey It sucks I mean really sucks ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the I was really pissed of about last night I go to school in Ohio I know the Indians suck so why show them If I were Bill Clement I would shoot Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the ie because of contract obligations screw you Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit GO HAWKS JB
