From nlu Nelson Lu Subject Re NHL Draft In article SHAWN LUDDINGTON writes As for the picks Ottawa picks which means it is almost that Alexander Daigle will go He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or IMO I would take He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Daigle didn't show this for his junior San Jose will then get Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think that's it or a defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong The last name is Niedermayer as in New Jersey's Scott's last name because you guessed it they are But Rob Niedermayer is a center not a I am not sure that the Sharks will take They aren't saying much but they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov along with Chris Pronger's name has also been My guess is that they'll take They may take Pronger except that they already have too many defensive GO CALGARY FLAMES Al MacInnis for Norris Gary Roberts for Hart and Smythe GO EDMONTON OILERS Go for playoffs next year Stay in Edmonton Nelson Lu contact for the San Jose Sharks
