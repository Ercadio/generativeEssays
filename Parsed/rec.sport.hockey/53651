From Vladimir Zhivov Subject Flames Truly Brutal in Loss As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon dropping a decision to the LA Most of the Flames neglected to show up especially in their own zone as the Kings hit at least five posts The Flames best line was probably Skrudland Paslawski Berube which tells how bad the Flames were Gary Suter scored a great goal in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D men Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others but also made some bonehead For the Kings Pat Conacher was especially The games was VERY chippy as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it there were high sticks cross checks punches hits from Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from Flames dominated the game physically but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals Calgary went with D men as Roger Johansson played LW he looked lost IMHO I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh Paul Kruse or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's Gretzky left the game in the period with a charley horse no idea how serious he didn't I still think the Flames should win this series but they better buckle Vlad the Impaler
