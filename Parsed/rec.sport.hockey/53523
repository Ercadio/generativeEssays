From Staffan Axelsson Subject Re Bruins Pens the Ulf Neeley fight Matt Brown writes more about the Messier Samuelsson incident While this is true strictly speaking it was the Rocksteady replicant who initially used his stick illegally to measure Messier's There is no question in my mind from seeing the replay in slo mo that Ulf was coming at Messier with intent to hasta la vista in mind and should have been gone for I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't It was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being Slo mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really Besides if Messier can't take the heat he should stay out of the So Staffan how is Mattias Timmander doing this year And any impression on Markus Czeriew lost my roster list on Hammerby Does it look like they will make it to the Eliteserien for next year And then get stomped if Markus goes to Boston Well Matt Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league team yet just the MoDo junior team so I predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the B' I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type of player on the B's team too As for Mariusz Czerkawski he has had a great season for Hammarby in division He scored if I remember correctly points this season and then we have to keep in mind that a point season in Sweden is considered very good due to the limited number of Mariusz is Djurgarden property he was just on loan to Hammarby so he will play in Elitserien next season unless the B's can get him of I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this Staffan Staffan Axelsson contact for Swedish hockey
