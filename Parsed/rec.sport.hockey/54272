From Chuq Von Rospach Subject Re SHARKS Kingston Fired Sherri Nichols writes In article steve Steve Cole writes I think the three headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant Doesn't sound like a bad strategy to No and in fact that was Ferreira's original strategy which the troika proceeded to simply continue to There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper and he's tweaking it a bit second time around One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal contributions before he was fired so it's not clear that this would have been Besides they were marginal Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came THIS close to trading Kelly Kisio which if the rumors I've heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three headed consensus oriented Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn't With or without Mullen they weren't going to be a playoff team what good does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of Not that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking but his motivation simply wasn't there and that kind of thing can affect the An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept because of his I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping The youth movement has its advantages look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept But you have to find the right Right balance for what That's the At the time they let Skriko go we hadn't yet had the major injury bugs that killed us I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad but at that point that wasn't the And since the choice was more one of Skriko someone like John Carter I think the right choice was made for that time Chuq IMHO Von Rospach ESD Support Training DAL AUX Member SFWA Editor OtherRealms GEnie ALink CHUQ Minor League fans San Jose Giants A San Francisco Giants fans The Stick NOT San Jose Sharks fans New seat TBD
