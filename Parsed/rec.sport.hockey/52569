From Roger Maynard Subject Re NHL team leaders in In Deepak Chhabra writes Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne on the ice can be blamed on he is a Winnipeg has a lousy defensive record Let's put it another John Cullen's is What's your excuse for him That his powerplay points don't count Neither do Selanne' Are you comparing Cullen to Salami I would say that that is If Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end The object of the game is not to feed Selanne it is to And feeding Selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way to Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to Excuse me Are the Jets playing hockey Let me but just They have allowed more goals than they have Sounds an awful lot like Salami's to Sounds like they would be just as well off or better if he played the solid two way game that our friends in Finland claim he is capable But if he did that he wouldn't be chal lenging for the league lead in goals would he The Bi Planes might be challenging for first You're worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team Now let's have compared Timo to Anderson and Who's next Mike Foligno We DON'T KNOW what Selanne does We do know what Jet's management And again the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to do what he does best it is to win hockey What he does best is I refer you to my comment Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he can play a solid two way I would have to say that this style of contribution would be more conducive to Or don't you think so As it is now Selanne is a grandstanding goal Did you see the way he parades around with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal You would think the Messiah had Nope didn't see I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after his I don't believe it You did compare him to Foligno And I honestly hadn't read this far It would help if you used a little discrimination in your Your contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren't trying to be merely cordially as always rm Roger Maynard
