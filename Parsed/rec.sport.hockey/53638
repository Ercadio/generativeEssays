From Gary L Dare Subject Re Rangers name Keenan coach UPI writes in NEW YORK UPI Mike Keenan whose NHL coaching history has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for winning has come to the city that embraces victors above all Well I could become a fan Seriously this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the Islanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost everywhere that I've sampled in fact the playoffs almost don't exist Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One's midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near orgasm over Keenan's Summarizing Keenan is a winner and will give the Broadway Bums 'da business' in pursuing the next Cup chase The Chicago Blackhawks cut their last tie with Keenan when he was forced out as general manager in He had given up Chicago's coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil This will be an interesting combination to watch Keenan has been paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his advice on any player moves will be listened to A lot of big player moves will happen remember that Keenan got rid of Denis The country club days are over When Keenan left Chicago I couldn't help but think about him as our coach '' Smith There was an indication he would be taken off the I feared that and couldn't let that '' If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered Keenan the big money to put up and shut up back in January the Rangers might not be heading for golf now Keenan takes on a demoralized team that offers him a chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects at the highest salary ever commanded by an NHL The Rangers owned by Gulf Western have bestowed upon Keenan an unprecedented million four year deal I've known Mike a long time '' Messier We've won two Canada Cups He's been to the finals three Maybe we miss just one more element to win the Stanley I don't think he's the same person he was years ago or even five years I think he has changed and bettered himself with '' One of Keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier will be the team's The timing of the move gives the Rangers' new coach months to prepare for the NHL draft June and Neil Smith may not back off the their trade happy By then Smith might have some bargains on Keenan's advice like maybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi gld Je me souviens Gary Dare gld GO Winnipeg Jets GO gld Selanne Domi Stanley
