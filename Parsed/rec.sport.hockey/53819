From Valerie Hammerl Subject Re NHL Team Captains In article writes In article Anna Matyas writes Michael Collingridge writes And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other team captain trivia would be Wasn't Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to Pittsburgh Chris Chelios was Montreal's co captain with Guy Carbonneau when he was traded to Chicago for Denis Savard and Peter Stastny was captain of the Quebec Nordiques when he was traded to New Also Mark Messier was captain of the Edmonton Oilers when he was traded to New How about Dale Hawerchuk with Winnipeg when he was traded to Buffalo was he captain too I think I should not forget Wayne you know who when he was traded to he was Didn't they strip Wendel Clark of his captaincy in Toronto Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up Ramsey's now a Penguin Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno who's now a leaf He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff who went I forget Ruff had it from Perreault who retired so I guess that's where the streak Or did it After all Danny Gare was captain before him and he went to Jim Scoenfeld Gerry Meehan and Floyd Smith are the others in reverse order last to I was a bit young at the time so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld but he ultimately went to Detroit and Meehan went to Vancouver Atlanta and Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he played for This is actually getting Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded almost unless you're a franchise Valerie Hammerl Birtday n An event when friends get together set your dessert on fire then laugh and sing while you frantically try to blow it
