From Robbie Po RAP Subject Re I was right in the first place In article vzhivov cunews , Vladimir Zhivov says In RAP Robbie Po RAP writes Red Wings vs Maple Leafs Maple Leafs in Comment It's kind of tough to rely on Yzerman as the team's main weapon He's a great palyer, but Dino knows all about choking, which puts the burden on Steve even more Potvin's had a hell of a season and goaltending is what you need in the playoffs For a great prognosticator , you seem to remember very little playoff history Dino always shows up in the playoffs, which is why he is a great sleeper pick in pools Don't forget about Fedorov, one of the top players in the NHL, IMHO, and Coffey who has the most Stanley Cup rings of any active players correct me if I'm wrong Wings in a cakewalk Oh yeah, how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick Division He choked up games to last year and got swept away in the second round two years ago He rarely, if ever, makes it out of the division Canucks vs Jets Canucks in Comment It's more like Vancouver vs Selanne King and Domi for enforcing help Winnipeg out a little, maybe a game Canucks have their number Except that the Canuck are playing like shit Winnipeg can win this one, though I think Vancouver will manage to slip by So are the Islanders, but they can still pull it out Vancouver has Winnipeg's number, so it really doesn't matter Flames vs Kings Flames in Comment games looks good as the Kings always seem to battle it out Flames are back in running and won't know memories of last year's season Gretzky is on a tear, but there are too many surrounding the Kings Kings always seem to battle it out When Where Kings always seem to go at least or , they never play a four or five game serious There's a difference between battling it out and pulling it out, as I take Calgary to pull it out in Robbie Po PGH PENGUINS We do what comes naturally Patrick Division Semi's ' STANLEY CUP You see now, wait for the PENGUINS , Devils ' CHAMPIONS possibility, don't you see a Penguins lead, STRAIGHT WINS strong resemblance DG '
