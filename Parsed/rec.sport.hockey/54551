From The Always Fanatical Patrick Ellis IO MAINE MAINE EDU Subject Re BUFFALO , Boston Defense I'm personally expecting Moog Blue played fairly decent alright spectacular at times in his a game but Moog has the experience What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out at the very least until your team scores Blue didn't face that kind of pressure on Tuesday The Bruins will come out storming that is for sure I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston except for two bad passes in game one really hasn't played that bad , As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting There game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo IMHO Pat Ellis P S GO BRUINS GO UMAINE BLACK BEARS NUMBER HOCKEY EAST REGULARS SEASON CHAMPIONS HOCKEY EAST TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS PAUL KARIYA, HOBEY BAKER AWARD WINNER NCAA DIV HOCKEY TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS M A I N E GGGGOOOOOOO BBBLLLUUEEEE
