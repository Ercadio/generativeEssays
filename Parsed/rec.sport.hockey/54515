From The Edge Subject Re KINGS EVEN SERIES AT STAUER SHINES In article dvb ick David Van Beveren writes Vladimir Zhivov writes Game report deleted it bad ref'ing won't affect this series which should only go two more games all things being The Kings just put on an exibition of hustle team play and consistent pounding and took it back to Calgary with the series tied at games The final score was with the third goal an empty netter at of the third Conacher This is not an official game report just my observations from the Melrose made a wise decision and put Stauber back in Robb had something to prove and he did in stopping of while facing a fierce Calgary There were numerous 'highlight film' Kings third and fourth lines rose to the occasion playing rough while avoiding bad Warren Rychel scored the game winner early in the second Rookie defenseman Alexi Zhitnik scored the first from the blue line late in the Dave Taylor is He suffered a broken nose partway through the second pariod checked from behind into the boards by Roberts who got and a He came back late in the third and was on the ice when Conacher scored the empty Actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the The Kings go to guys still are not No goals from Kurri Granato Sandstrom or Robitaille who have a total of points between You forgot about If any of these guys start scoring the Kings will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as McCreary He called McSorely for high sticking someone who was already on the ice and Sandstrom for high sticking when he himself was already on the He missed many flagrant stick penalties including one from Flame goalie Jeff Reese who followed Granato out to almost the blue line where he cross checked He called the game very inconsistently with a series of ticky tack penalties in the first and almost none in the Can't the NHL supply decent officiating I was sitting directly across the ice from Ron and Nancy When the empty netter was scored Nancy leapt out of her seat with both fists high in the Way to go Nancy This series is still too close to Tuesday's game may be the deciding I expect King might put Vernon back in even though Reese had two good games in Reese has historically been good in This was only the second time he lost This move would be good for the Kings since Vernon is such a I am sure that Stauber will get the call for the Stauber will be in net on Hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name Robb Stopper The firswt two lines of the Kings have to wake While it is great to see you cannot depend on Pat Conacher and Warren Rychel for all of your I expect Sandstrom Granato and Gretzky might be put back together on a line like they were early in the This would leave Kurri Carson and Luc as the On paper these two lines look Let's see if they can make it I believe this is how they know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom but he has been putting a number of people on Also the Carson Robataille Kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other Hopefully GO KINGS dvb It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc after his slight breakaway in the third I think he was steamed on the bench this emotion might help him break his Also I have noticed Blake has had a few really good chances to score but has fanned or shot Is the injury still affecting him The E D G E
