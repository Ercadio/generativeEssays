diagram sketch is the program with graphical elements representing the programming Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram program Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering numerical analysis statistics The tool allows any Virtual Instrument VI a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument to be used as a part of any other virtual National Instruments markets plug in digital signal processing DSP boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real time acquisition and analysis at a personal New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this The tools range from low level debugging software to high level block diagram

ColorStudio and ImageStudio ColorStudio is an image editing and paint package from Letraset that has more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and therefore more difficult to Several steps are often required to accomplish that which can be done in a single step using The application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can easily end up with images in the

Information Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System Michael Landy co wrote and sell a general purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration It is called HIPS and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single It has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and It handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution Fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics Over such image transformation programs have been As a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and Additionally HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom New users become effective using HIPS on their first HIPS features images that are self Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX filters'' It comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently It runs under the UNIX operating It is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax Sun Apollo Masscomp NCR Tower Iris IBM AT For image display and input drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage Ikonas image processors and the Sun Sun Sun and Sun We also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages Sun gfx Sun console Matrox VIP ITI IP Lexidata Macintosh II X windowing system and Iris The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because of HIPS is machine Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production oriented It is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar
