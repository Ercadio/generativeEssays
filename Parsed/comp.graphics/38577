From Ed Stastny Subject The OTIS Project FTP sites for original art and images OTIS Project ' The Operative Term Is STIMULATE this file last WHAT IS OTIS OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and Digital The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital Perhaps they'll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup they'll be someone will dig them If that doesn't interest OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing Suddenly life is breathed into your by merit of it's stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the that's what they're here WHERE OTIS currently as of

directories house two types of image files GIF and GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around JPG viewers are a bit tougher to If you can't find one but do have a GIF viewer you can obtain a JPG to GIF conversion program which will change JPG files to a standard GIF OTIS also accepts animation

people to Also include some biographical information on yourself we'll be having info files on each contributing artist and their You can also just upload a text file of info about yourself instead of

they can Even if you don't have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an SASE or for disk postage and packing to get a slab o As of we're at about megabytes of files and Email me for current archive size and DISTRIBUTION The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and If you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite BBS even just post this info file It would be keen of USE If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit You will either find this in the file for the image or series of in the Artists directory under the Artists If permission isn't explicitly given then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for If no info is available email me and I'll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact When you DO use permitted work it's always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their NAMING IMAGES Please keep the names of your files in dos That means keep the filename before or to eight characters or The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series Thus Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like OR OR ETC Keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all CREATING IMAGE FILES When creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact You may also want to include a title address or other information you'd like people to HMMM That's about it for More guidelines will be added as Your
