From jih shin ho Subject I have posted to You may distribute this program freely for non commercial use if no fee is There is no The author is not responsible for any damage caused by this Important changes since version Fix bugs in file management system file displaying Improve file management system more user friendly Fix bug in XPM version Fix bugs in TARGA reading Fix bug in GEM IMG Add support for PCX and GEM IMG Auto skip macbinary Introduction This program can let you READ WRITE and DISPLAY images with different It also let you do some special effects ROTATION DITHERING on Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different Include simple file management Support 'slide show' There is NO LIMIT on image Currently this program supports bits If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor you must have VESA If you want to modify video driver please read section Hardware Requirement PC or MSDOS or min amount of ram is bytes Maybe less memory will also work I recommend min bytes for better performance Hard disk for swapping virtual memory The following description is borrowed from Supported Wares Up to of extended memory expanded under VCPI Up to of disk space used for swapping SuperVGA color mode up to XMS VDISK memory allocation strategies VCPI programs such as QEMM DESQview and Unsupported DPMI Microsoft Windows Features emulator bit unix ish environment flat memory model SVGA Installation Video drivers and are borrowed from If you use Western Digital VGA chips read This is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible with original version But some people report that this is not compatible with other DJGPP programs in their If you encounter this problem DON'T put within search Please read for how to run this If you choose as video driver add 'nc ' to environment For example driver x xxxxx nc If you don't have add 'emu x xxxxx ' to environment For example driver x xxxxx emu x xxxxx Notes I only test and Other drivers are not I have modified to support bits You don't need to use vesa If doesn't work please try For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display please use except users You can find vesa BIOS driver from mirrors

Detail Initialization Set default display type to highest display Find allowable screen resolution for video driver only When you run this program you will enter 'read' Whthin this menu you can press any function key except If you move or copy files you will enter 'write' the 'write' menu is much like 'read' menu but only allow you to change The header line in 'read' menu includes d xx f xx t xx d display f number of t number of tagged pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use for reading current pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current This program will automatically determine which format this file The procedure is First check magic If fail check standard Still fail report pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show' If delay time is program will wait until you hit a key except ESCAPE If any error occurs program will make a ESCAPE to pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display pressing ALT X in 'read' menu will quit program without Once image file is successfully read you will enter 'screen' Within this menu is turn You can do special effect on pressing RETURN show in graphic mode press RETURN SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text pressing TAB change processing This program allows you to do special effects on bit or bit pressing Left Right arrow change display pressing SPACE save current image to B W Dither save as black white image bit Grey Scale save as grey image bits Full Color save as color image bits True Color save as bit This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to Some questions are format Finally This program will prompt you a If you want to save file under another directory other than current directory please press after pressing SPACE you will enter ' ' You can change directory to what you Then pressing SPACE this program will prompt you 'original' pressing RETURN this program will prompt you 'selected' filename filename under bar This program supports bits This Program is MEMORY If you don't have enough memory the performance is If you want to save bits image try GIF then TIFF LZW then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then If you want to save bits image lossless try TIFF LZW or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster No one is better for true image I recommend Jpeg for storing bits images even bits Not all subroutines are fully tested This document is not well If you have any PROBLEM SUGGESTION COMMENT about this program Please send to I need your suggestion to improve this There is NO anonymous ftp on this site information Program user interface and some subroutines written by Jih Shin Some subroutines are borrowed from XV and PBMPLUS dec Tiff and Jpeg reading writing are through public domain Compiled with You can get whole DJGPP package from or mirror For example mirrors msdos djgpp For Thoese who want to modify video driver get GRX source code from or mirror For HiColor and TrueColor bits of colors is set to bits of colors is set to bits of colors is set to Acknowledgment I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission to let me use their Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg Thank Without DJGPP I can't do any thing on Jih Shin Ho
