Subject Marching Cubs From Hello, Hello, I was wondering if anyone knew of a PC or MAC implementation of the marching cubes algorithm that will output the individual faces If there is no such application, might there be some C source code that I could modify to implement the algorithm and get to the individual faces Thanks in advance Sincerly Tracy Tracy J Abildskov Phone FAX Address Brigham Young University Department of Psychology E mail Provo, UT USA
