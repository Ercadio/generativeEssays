From R Hawkes Subject Where did all the texture rules go Hi I've noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes positioned carefully to a file that when you reload it after restarting they are given a default position and But if you save to a file their positions orientation are Does anyone know why this information is not stored in the file Nothing is explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have the format for the file Is the file format available from somewhere Rych Rycharde Hawkes email Virtual Environment Laboratory of Psychology Tel of Edinburgh Fax
