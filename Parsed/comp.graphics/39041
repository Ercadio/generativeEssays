Subject Re Fractal terrain generator From Paul David Bourke Daniel E Bradley writes Does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac, something I could hopefully import into a D program like Swivel or Stratavision I know Infini D has built in capabilities, but I don't have access to Infini D I downloaded two programs from Umich, in graphics fractals, but both were from and crashed under System I think they were Black and white anyway Please, email me if you know of anything, as I don't check the newsgroups very often Thanks in advance Dan Bradley Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into D modelling packages Be warned, the data content is high and brings many packages to their knees We use it primarily for MicroStation but it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US It is wuarchive wustl edu my stuff is located in the mirrors architec directory Please FTP the README file first Paul D Bourke School of Architecture, Property, Planning The University of Auckland Ph x Private Bag Fax Auckland, New Zealand Paul D Bourke School of Architecture, Property, Planning The University of Auckland Ph x Private Bag Fax Auckland, New Zealand
