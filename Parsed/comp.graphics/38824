From Chris Lilley Subject Re bit graphics In article A , Wonko the Sane writes I was recently talking to a possible employer mine and he made a reference to a bit graphics computer image processing system I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that Anyway, he claimed it had bit color a bit alpha channel That's bits of info what could that possibly be for Specifically the bit color That's trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve Is this an anti aliasing thing Or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor Well bit colour could be for improved resolution but bits per channel seems like a bit excessive I have seen a paper that quoted bits per channel of bits for computational precision More than that would seem to be wasted Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding Most likely however is that there are two separate bit bits per component frame buffers This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous frame is displayed This makes for smoother animation sadly, I have access to none of them Just a DEC Sigh Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the range can take a PXG Turbo card with bits per pixel Full double buffering Two bit buffers , a bit Z buffer and an extra bit buffer for off screen image storage Mind you the card costs more than your workstation Chris Lilley Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK M PL Internet C C L Voice Fax Janet C C L
