From Chris Lilley Subject Re bit In article Wonko the Sane writes I was recently talking to a possible employer mine and he made a reference to a bit graphics computer image processing I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to Anyway he claimed it had bit color a bit alpha That's bits of info what could that possibly be for Specifically the bit color That's trillion colors many more than the human eye can Is this an anti aliasing thing Or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain Well bit colour could be for improved resolution but bits per channel seems like a bit I have seen a paper that quoted bits per channel of bits for computational More than that would seem to be Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range RGB is a cube so it is a compact Most likely however is that there are two separate bit bits per component frame This set up called double buffering allows a complex picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous frame is This makes for smoother sadly I have access to none of Just a DEC Well hey if you want to brag about numbers the range can take a PXG Turbo card with bits per Full double buffering Two bit buffers a bit Z buffer and an extra bit buffer for off screen image Mind you the card costs more than your Chris Lilley Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road Manchester Internet Voice Fax Janet
