From Ricardo Hernandez Muchado Subject Re Rumours about In article Sean McMains writes In article Ricardo Hernandez Muchado writes And CD I's CPU doesn't help much I understand it is a supposedly a variation of a running at something like With this speed you truly need Wow A I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the which is supposedly the next in the D Sean the exists Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old Quicktime with the Compact Video I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials to be precise running on a Centris at about very nicely bit color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation though as you've implied the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic Sean McMains Check out the Gopher Phone University of North Texas New Bands Info server Fax Box at E Mail Denton TX McM Sean I don't want to get into a 'mini war' by what I am going to say but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris you'll see why please no flames I reserve those for I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a booth I walked by and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime I think the quicktime they were using was the old one They digitized a guy talking there in It played back quite nicely and in real The guy then expanded the window resized to by in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't or about It dropped to like Then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to Then I asked him what Mac he was He was using a Quadra don't know what model to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator Don't misunderstand me I just want to clarify But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not I can claim a tad more with overscan being done in colors in my computer not from the hardisk at with Scala But I agree if we consider MPEG stuff I think a multimedia consumer low priced box has a lot of I just think would make it no longer CD Raist New owner in x in y in colors from a bit I LOVE IT New Low Fat don't e mail me I don't have a valid address nor can I send e mail
