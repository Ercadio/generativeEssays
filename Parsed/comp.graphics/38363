From Ricardo Hernandez Muchado Subject Re Rumours about DO In article A , Sean McMains writes In article A Ricardo Hernandez Muchado, writes And CD I's CPU doesn't help much either I understand it is a supposedly a variation of a running at something like Mhz With this speed, you truly need sprites Wow A I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these, especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the , which is supposedly the next in the x lineup D Sean, the exists Ricardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old Quicktime with the Compact Video codec I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials, to be precise running on a Centris at about fps very nicely bit color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation, though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic material Sean McMains Check out the Gopher Phone University of North Texas New Bands Info server Fax P O Box at seanmac acs unt edu E Mail Denton TX McM Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini war' by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, you'll see why please, no flames, I reserve those for c s m a I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there I walked by, and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies I think the quicktime they were using was the old one They digitized a guy talking there in x xx something It played back quite nicely and in real time The guy then expanded the window resized to x by xx in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't fps or about fps anymore It dropped to like fps Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to fps Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know what model, to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim x a tad more with overscan being done in , colors in my computer not from the hardisk at fps with Scala MM But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer low priced box has a lot of market I just think DO would make it, no longer CD I Raist New A owner in x, in y in , colors from a bit palette I LOVE IT New Low Fat sig don't e mail me I don't have a valid address nor can I send e mail
