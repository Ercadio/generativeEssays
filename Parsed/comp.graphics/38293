From Cheinan Marks Subject Re Please Recommend Graphics Library For Robert Carpenter writes Hi Netters I'm building a CAD package and need a graphics library that can handle some rudimentry tasks such as hidden line removal shading animation Can you please offer some recommendations I'll also need contact info name address if you can find Thanks Please Post Your Responses in case others have same need Bob Carpenter The following is extracted from sumex It should also be on the I think there is source for some applications that may have some bearing on your Poke around the source I've never used this package nor do I know anyone who did but the price is right Hope this Cheinan Abstracts of files as of Thu Apr PST Directory info mac source BINHEX grafsys Date Fri Mar From Christian Steffen Ove Franz To Subject GrafSys in incoming directory A GrafSys short description follows Programmers GrafSys Vers now Version is mainly a bugfix for THINK C THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C I PROMISE The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the If you have problems feel free to contact The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run Those of you who don't know what all this is about read Programmers GrafSys What it is Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three dimensional scenes Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three dimensional molecules And didn't the task of writing your conversions routines keep you from actually doing it Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes but what has it to do with this package ' read GrafSys is a THINK Pascal C library that provides you with simple routines for building saving loading as resources and manipulating independent rotating around arbitrary achses translating and scaling three dimensional Objects not just simple single line GrafSys supports full clipping animation and some primitive hidden line hidden surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections If you can't understand a word don't worry this is just showing off for those who know about The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the transformations and your own routines to do the actual Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to GrafSys comes in two One for the and or above The other version uses fixed point arithmetic and runs on any Both versions are source compatibel GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of graphics and how to use the If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object class However I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP Guild' GrafSys is free for any non commercial Read the documentation Enjoy Christian Franz
