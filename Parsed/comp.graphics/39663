From John Nagle Subject Re Point in Polygon routine needed Andrew Lewis Tepper at andrew cmu edu writes I don't know if this routine is standard , I just came up with it recently For a polygon of points p pn, and a point P, make a table as follows T angle from p to P to p T angle from p to P to p T n angle from pn to P to p express all angles as PI angle PI Add all entries in the table If the sum , the point is outside If the sum is PI, the point is inside If the point is xPI, you have a strange polygon If ANY angle was PI, the point is on the border I think it's known, but it's neat Can it be extended to D John Nagle
