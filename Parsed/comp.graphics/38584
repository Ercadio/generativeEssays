From Nicholas Hess Subject Hitatchi Raster Format HRF Our shop uses a package called CADCore very good to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package a header is added to the file which makes it unreadable by the supplied We would like to be able to ship some of the already altered raster images for further use on our So here are my questions What is the Hitachi format I need this format so I can recognize precisely what to strip I strongly suspect that it's a compressed format if so then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF It would be really nice to find some sort of hrftopbm converter out I've already searched some of the more well known ftp sites which contain graphics formats documentation with no So if you know or knwo someone who knows please email
