From Marcel Wijkstra AIO Subject Re BW hardcopy of colored window Martin Stein writes I use xwd xpr from the and various programs of the ppm tools to print hardcopies of colored X My problem is I don't like It gives at least the version does louzy output the hardcopy looks very grainy to Instead I use This takes full advantage PostScript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel image to black and white So if you have a PostScript printer try xwdtopnm xwdfile convert to PPM ppmtopgm to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops noturn to PostScript lpr print pnmtops Has several neat options but use them with care If you want your image to be wide use pnmtops noturn scale width noturn Prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it is high width Specifies the PAPER width not the image width see below scale Is used because if the image is small it may fit within a width less than and will thus be printed smaller than If you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper In short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size but it will not blow it up Hope this X Marcel Wijkstra AIO X Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science X University of Amsterdam The Netherlands Life Fortunately I've got a
