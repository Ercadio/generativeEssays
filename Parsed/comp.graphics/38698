From leyfre Frederic Leymarie Subject Re Developable Surface In article Abel writes Hi netters I am currently doing some investigations on Developable Surface Can anyone familiar with this topic give me some information or sources which can allow me to find some infomation of developable surface Thanks for your help Abel A developable surface is you can lay it or roll it flat on the plane it may require you to give it a cut a cylinder a cone a plane of course or any surface or patch having vanishing Gaussian intrinsic curvature with singular Hessian the matrix of derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch are developable In more technical words a developable surface is locally isometric to a plane at all Think also of the sphere or the earth which in a non developable whatever way s you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry which treats surfaces manifolds do Carmo's book Book author do Carmo Manfredo title Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces year publisher Prentice Hall note Enjoy Frederic Leymarie McGill University Electrical McRCIM University Montreal QC CANADA FAX
