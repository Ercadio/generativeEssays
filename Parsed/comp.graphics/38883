from byron john kidd subject pov where sorry if this is a faq but "where can i get a 286 (16 bit) version of pov-ray ? " any help would be greatly appreciated. i need the 286 version since turbo pascal won't let me run a 32 bit
program from within my program. any info on this would also be a
great help. thanks, byron. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- byron kidd | e-mail : computing services |
