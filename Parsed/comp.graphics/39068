From Subject for scanners needed Hello all I need to make some torso scans and would like the phone numbers of companies in the midwest that make scans and the numbers of companies that make the sanners ie Cyberware Does anyone have an idea of how much a single scan costs and the best format to save it in I am not sure on what software platform I will be using it in probably either Softimage or So I think a spline based format would be Please forward the numbers to me personally as I am having problems accessing USENET Thanks in advance Patrick Maun Paul MN
