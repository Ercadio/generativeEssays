From Access Bus Industry Gp Subject Re Software Creator's Contest Intro to RE the Software Creator's Contest Announcement WHAT IS is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral is a serial protocol that uses simple low cost technology to link multiple devices to a single PC Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads locators Mice Trackballs Joysticks printers VR gloves digitizers sensors actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host Applications such as CAD CAM Data Acquisition Simulation Virtual Reality Multiple Player Single PC Games Education and many many more can now take advantage of the technology that puts Plug and Play on every The offers advantages to end users and developers of systems and Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software As an open standard enables cross platform use of the same TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION technology is an open specification enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or has a bus topology That is a single host can accommodate up to peripheral data rate is Kbits Physical Layer is a serial bus architecture based on hardware protocol with one data line and one clock Standard low cost microcontrollers handle bit level handshaking including automatic arbitration and clock Software Protocols The communication protocol is composed of three levels Protocol Base Protocol and Application PROTOCOL This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock Bus transactions include addressing framing of bits into bytes and byte acknowledgment by the BASE PROTOCOL Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple The host becomes the The Base Protocol defines the format of an message envelope which is an bus transaction with additional semantics including Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto addressing and hot Auto addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses without the need for setting jumpers or Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running without APPLICATION PROTOCOL This is the highest level of the protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of Each type requires a different Application Three broad device types have been identified keyboards locators and text support on the PC All three levels of the protocol are supported on the An add on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical An Manager TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the device Drivers are available for multiple keyboards locators and printers for DOS and Windows Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device To Contact ABIG the Industry Group Postal Address Altair Way Suite Sunnyvale CA Internet Email Fax Voice
