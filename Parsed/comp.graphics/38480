From jbulf Jeff Bulf Subject Re detecting double points in bezier curves In article Ferdinand Oeinck writes I'm looking for any information on detecting and or calculating a double point and or cusp in a bezier An algorithm literature reference or mail about this is very appreciated There was a very useful article in one of the issues of Transactions On I believe Maureen Stone was one of the Sorry not to be more I don't have the reference here with The article actually was more general than this giving a way to decide whether a given cubic Bezier curve contains cusps intersection points or whatever The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH course notes for the course called Math for Siggraph or something like dr memory
