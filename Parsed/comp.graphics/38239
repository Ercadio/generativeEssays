From John Heaton Subject POV reboots PC after memory upgrade Up until last week, I have been running POVray v on my under DOS without any major problems Over Easter I increased the memory from Meg to Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS I had a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win on the same system and it now works fine, even if a lot slower I would like to go back to using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas John John Heaton NRS Central Administrator MCC Network Unit, The University, Oxford Road, Manchester, M PL Phone FAX Packet G YYH G YYH GB PWY GBR EU
