From lm rrz Uni Koeln DE Erwin H Keeve Subject Polygon Reduction for Marching Cubes Dear Reader, I'am searching for an implementation of a polygon reduction algorithm for marching cubes surfaces I think the best one is the reduction algorithm from Schroeder et al , SIGGRAPH ' So, is there any implementation of this algorithm, it would be very nice if you could leave it to me Also I'am looking for a fast connectivity test for marching cubes surfaces Any help or hints will be very useful Thanks a lot ,,, o o oOO OOo Erwin Keeve adress Peter Welter Platz W Cologne , Germany Dept of Computergraphics phone Computeranimation FAX Academy of Media Arts Cologne Email
