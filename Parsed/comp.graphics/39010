as someone who would _love_ to see xv go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me. a) xv can load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit x displays. b) all other operations (crop, dither, smooth, etc.) are not
supported on 24 bit images. how hard would this be? -- ken fishkin
