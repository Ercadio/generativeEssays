From Randell Jesup Subject Re Products to handle HDTV moving pircture MB sec writes I'd like to know if there is any system CPU HD array framebuffer which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime HDTV has about MB frame, so recording playing moving picture will need about MB sec bandwidth I'm thinking to treat the raw data not compressed Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully uncompressed HDTV Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under MB, even using bits pixel which is more bits than you actually need or should be enough for a moving picture x x bits is MB I'm guessing at HDTV resolution it may be a bit wider than , I'm fairly sure of the number for most of the digital proposals I hope you have a very fast memory system as well MB s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system Unless you have a very compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data You don't have to go to full compression to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier to deal with GNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a word processor Doug Mohney, in comp arch Randell Jesup, Jack of quite a few trades, Commodore Engineering or rutgers cbmvax jesup BIX rjesup Disclaimer Nothing I say is anything other than my personal opinion
