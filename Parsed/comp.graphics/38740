from boris pruessmann subject re vga scrolling hi if you want to have soft scrolling on your vga, you have to change some intern registers of the crtc. but it is a little bit difficult to explain, so i would suggest, you take a look at "the programming of the ega/vga-adapter" by addison-wesley. you will find all useful descriptions for every available vga-register. -boris --- ---> boris pruessmann
