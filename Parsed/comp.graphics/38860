Subject Re POVray tga rle From Craig Andrew Humphrey In article Jihun Park writes Hello I have some problem in converting tga file generated by POVray to rle When I convert I do not get any warning But if I use xloadimage something is edited I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but I do not spend time to install Even I do not want to generate from POVray and then convert them to rle if to rle works but it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs more steps to finally convert to rle say cat rawtorle rleflip Does any body out there have same experience problems Well for starters why use rle files You might have a specific program that needs them OK but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a targa file becomes a or less The latest versions of XV and xloadimage both handle jpeg And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c djpeg Even at quality you can't see the difference the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an gif Later'ish Craig I didn't do it nobody saw me do it you can't prove ccc c
