From Rene Walter Subject CView answers A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in Since he isn't in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name So here it comes CView has quite a number of The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most As far as I can determine it has to do with the temp files that CView CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory The problem you mention occurs as far as I can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this As Cview decodes a jpeg it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with bit colour Then for bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the bit colour While it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour Then when it does the last chunk of bit data it recopies all the data from the bit file to your screen It does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not The result of this process is the following If it runs out of disk space when writing the first bit file all you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes reads aren't If it has enough room for the bit data but runs out of room for the bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen However then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the This is just a guess but probably fairly At least the general idea is on track I think although I have probably made errors in details about file I O The way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk The temp files for large JPEG's and bigger can be very large Meg Meg On some of the largest I have needed in excess of Meg free disk CView has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory and FAT table I can't remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable SO BE CAREFUL It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do On the other hand when choosing files in the Open Files menu CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi lighter Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory And really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing With much thanks to the originator of this Rene Walter Will I drown in tears of sorrow Is there hope for tomorrow Will this world ever get better Can't we all just live together I don't wanna live in strife I just wanna live my life I deserve to have a The Good Girls Future
