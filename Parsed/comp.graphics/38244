From Khun Yee Fung Subject Re looking for circle algorithm faster than Bresenhams On Wed, Apr GMT, Graeme Gill said Graeme Yes, that's known as Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for Graeme Incremental lines See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics, Graeme Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg I have tried to extrapolate this to circles but I can't figure out how to determine the length of the slices Any ideas Graeme Hmm I don't think I can help you with this, but you might Graeme take a look at the following Graeme Double Step Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles , Graeme X Wu and J G Rokne, Computer Graphics and Image processing, Graeme Vol , No , Mar , pp Graeme Double Step Generation of Ellipses , X Wu and J G Rokne, Graeme IEEE Computer Graphics Applications, May , pp Another paper you might want to consider is article fungdraw, title A Run Length Slice Line Drawing Algorithm without Division Operations , author Khun Yee Fung and Tina M Nicholl and A K Dewdney , journal Computer Graphics Forum , year , volume , number , pages C C Khun Yee Khun Yee Fung Department of Computer Science Middlesex College University of Western Ontario London, Ontario Canada N A B Tel Fax
