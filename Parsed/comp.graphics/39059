Gopher FAQ Q What is Gopher Q Where can I get Gopher software Q What do I need to access Gopher Q Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher Q Who Develops Gopher Software Q What is the relationship between Gopher and WAIS, WWW, ftp Q Are papers or articles describing Gopher available Q What is veronica Q What is Available for Biology Q What is Gopher A The Internet Gopher client server provides a distributed information delivery system around which a world campus wide information system CWIS can readily be constructed While providing a delivery vehicle for local information, Gopher facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers throughout the world Q Where can I get Gopher software A via anonymous ftp to boombox micro umn edu Look in the directory pub gopher Q What do I need to access Gopher A You will need a gopher client program that runs on your local PC or workstation There are clients for the following systems The directory following the name is the

Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client itself Put the following on a gopher server Type Host boombox micro umn edu Port Path Name Gopher Software Distribution Or point your gopher client at boombox micro umn edu, port and look in the gopher directory There are also a number of public telnet login sites available The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine consultant micro umn edu See Q for more information about this It is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites A client uses the custom features of the local machine mouse, scroll bars, etc A local client is also faster Q Where are there publicly available logins ie places to telnet to in order to get a taste of gopher for Gopher A Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize network lag Telnet Public Logins Hostname IP Login Area consultant micro umn edu gopher North America gopher uiuc edu gopher North America

gives faster response Furthermore many of the basic features of clients saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp sites etc are not available by the telnet logins Q Who Develops Gopher Software A Gopher was originally developed in April by the University of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help our campus find answers to their computer questions It has since grown into a full fledged World Wide Information System used by a large number of sites in the world Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to count The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached via e mail at , or via paper mail Internet Gopher Developers Union St SE Minneapolis, MN USA Or via FAX at Q What is the relationship between Gopher and WAIS, WWW, ftp A Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to Search local WAIS indices Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher clients Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher clients Be queried by WWW World Wide Web clients either using built in gopher querying or using native http querying Q Are papers or articles describing Gopher available A Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in The Whole Internet , Ed Kroll, O'Reilly,

veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher server menu titles in the entire gopher web As archie is to ftp archives, veronica is to gopherspace A veronica search produces a menu of gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the gopher protocol To try veronica, select it from the Other Gophers menu on Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at Name veronica search menu items in most of GopherSpace Type Port Path veronica
