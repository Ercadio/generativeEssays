From EWING TERRY Subject Raytriacing and animation Now I have a couple raytracing Just so you know I'm using PovRay both MS dos and Unix and I'm generating Targa files of varying ok so I can view these wonderful pictures on my What's the best way to get them on to paper Would it be possible to take it to Kinko's and have them make an actual picture on paper from it I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced Is this a bad idea Any tricks to it How would I get a sequence of targa files made into an animation that I could put on a videotape Is there a cheap way
