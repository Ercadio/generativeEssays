From Brent Subject Re Please Recommend Graphics Library For The Silent Assassin writes Robert Carpenter writes Can you please offer some recommendations It's really not that hard to There are books out there which explain everything and the basic functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty I wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the I would suggest that you take your code and submit it to to be distributed including to the ftp sites Many folks myself included would enjoy the extra Also Quickdraw has a lot of functions built in and Think pascal can access them and I would expect that THINK C could as If you can find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the Mac so should be Just to clarify the routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the ROM of the A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics I came across a demo of the Apple library and it actually did a However it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low level library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad It has nothing on GL for example where you can handle Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old GrafSys library Unsupported never was and no plans exist to do so in the future Undocumented unless you call header files If one knows something about graphics you could probably figure it out but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better output and is at the same time programmatically nicer easier to program Just my tax Brent
