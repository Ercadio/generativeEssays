> the problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon. there
are two ways to do this: use a somewhat tricky but by-now well
examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept o(n log n). both methods are discussed in
preparata and shamos, for example.
