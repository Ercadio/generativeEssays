From Barton Hodges Subject Stereoscopic imaging I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun For the most part I need to know if there is any hardware available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are sufficient to produce quality image Any information about the subject would be greatly Thanks
