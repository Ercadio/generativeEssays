From patrice cummings Subject polygon orientation in DXF I'm writing a program to convert files to a database format used by a graphics program I've My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW I've used Concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in CW or CCW Its easy enough to convert but if I don't know which way they are stored I dont know which direction the polygon should be visible If DXF doesn't handle this can anyone recommend a workaround The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file one stored CW and the other But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases Thanks in advance for any help Patrice
