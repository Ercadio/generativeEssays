From Louis van Dompselaar Subject Re images of earth In Richard Ottolini writes There is only one such copyrighted image and the company that generated is known to protect that That image took hundreds of man hours to build from the source satellite images so it is unlikely that competing images will appear So they should sue the newspaper I got it from for printing The article didn't say anything about Louis I'm hanging on your words Living on your breath Feeling with your skin Will I always be here In Your Room DM
