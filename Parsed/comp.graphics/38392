From Robert Barris Subject Re Rumours about In article Ricardo Hernandez Muchado writes In article Sean McMains writes In article Ricardo Hernandez Muchado writes And CD I's CPU doesn't help much I understand it is a supposedly a variation of a running at something like With this speed you truly need snip the is not a Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old Quicktime with the Compact Video I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials to be precise running on a Centris at about very nicely bit color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation though as you've implied the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic snip booth I walked by and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime I think the quicktime they were using was the old one They digitized a guy talking there in It played back quite nicely and in real The guy then expanded the window resized to by in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't or about It dropped to like Then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to Then I asked him what Mac he was He was using a Quadra don't know what model to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator Don't misunderstand me I just want to clarify The box is based on an ARM RISC processor one or two custom graphics chips a DSP a double speed CDROM and of RAM I'm a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM VRAM capacity It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica From RJ Mical of Amiga Lynx fame and Hal Josephson sp were there to talk about the machine and their We got to see the unit displaying full screen movies using the CompactVideo codec which was nice very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft and a very high frame rate to boot like Note however that the 's screen resolution is CompactVideo is pretty I also wanted to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine I have a and do this quite a bit The price of personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often if But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest I'm not sure how a Centris stacks up against the MHz ARM in the Obviously the ARM is faster but how much Rob Barris Quicksilver Software
