From Robert C Barris Subject Re Rumours about DO In article A Ricardo Hernandez Muchado writes In article A , Sean McMains writes In article A Ricardo Hernandez Muchado, writes And CD I's CPU doesn't help much either I understand it is a supposedly a variation of a running at something like Mhz With this speed, you truly need sprites snip the DO is not a Ricardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old Quicktime with the Compact Video codec I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials, to be precise running on a Centris at about fps very nicely bit color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation, though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic material snip booth there I walked by, and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies I think the quicktime they were using was the old one They digitized a guy talking there in x xx something It played back quite nicely and in real time The guy then expanded the window resized to x by xx in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't fps or about fps anymore It dropped to like fps Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to fps Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know what model, to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this The DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics chips, a DSP, a double speed CDROM, and MB of RAM VRAM I'm a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM VRAM capacity It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica, CA From DO, RJ Mical of Amiga Lynx fame and Hal Josephson sp were there to talk about the machine and their plan We got to see the unit displaying full screen movies using the CompactVideo codec which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft and a very high frame rate to boot like fps Note however that the DO's screen resolution is x CompactVideo is pretty amazing I also wanted to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine I have a Q and do this quite a bit The price of generality personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often, if ever But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest machines I'm not sure how a Centris MHz stacks up against the MHz ARM in the DO box Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much Rob Barris Quicksilver Software Inc
