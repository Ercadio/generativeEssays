From Graeme Gill Subject Re looking for circle algorithm faster than Bresenhams In article Michael Dillon writes I have an algorithm similar to Bresenhams line drawing algorithm that draws a line by stepping along the minor axis and drawing slices like AAAA BBBB CCCC in the following AAAA BBBB CCCC Yes that's known as Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for Incremental lines See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg I have tried to extrapolate this to circles but I can't figure out how to determine the length of the Any ideas I don't think I can help you with this but you might take a look at the following Double Step Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles Wu and Rokne Computer Graphics and Image processing Vol Double Step Generation of Ellipses Wu and Rokne IEEE Computer Graphics Applications May Graeme
