From Andre Yew Subject Re million vs thousand colors Henrik Harmsen writes bits per R G B gives horrible machbanding visible in almost any bits per R G B colors gives visible machbanding color gradient picture has almost no This color resolution is see some small machbanding on the smooth color gradient picture but all in all There ARE situiations where you get visible mach banding even in a bit If you create a very smooth color gradient of dark green white yellow or something and turn up the contrast on the monitor you will probably see some mach While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here he's using a common misconception that should be Mach banding will occur for any It is not the color quantization you see when you don't have enough It is the human eye's response to transitions or edges between The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker Andre Andre Yew
