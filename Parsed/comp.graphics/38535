From Kouhia Juhana Subject XV problems Please note the Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some Here is some text users of XV might find I have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can so fine program XV is that it is worth of I have also minor ideas for XV e mail me for Any misundertanding of mine is Juhana Kouhia clip Note that 'xv' saves only rasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg to gif to jpeg Also there's three kind of quantizers your final image quality depends on them This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while IMHO it is design error of 'xv' there should not be such confusing errors in There's two errors xv allows the saving of rasterized image as jpeg even the original is saving rasterized image instead of original should be a special case xv allows saving the rasterized image made with any quantizer the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases in saving the image if at all clip clip It is limit of XV but not limit of It is error in It is error that quantized rasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to As matter of fact I'm sure when XV were designed displays were It is not bad error to program a program for images only at that time but when image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support That were not done and now we have the program violate jpeg design and any image format the program has human interface Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal clip Some new items clip I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with option than with default option we The reason surely is the quantizer used as it is surprise the same than used in If you remember I have tested some In that test I found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly it actually gave image with bad I don't know is ppmquant improved any but I expect So use of XV's option is not very good I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant I'm sure rle people gives Another could be one used in ImageMagick I have not tested it so I can say nothing about clip clip Some minor bugs in human interface are Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away The buffer should be cleaned when the image is Also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when I'm writing something with editor or Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something In the color editor when I turn a color meter and release it XV updates the It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges clip
