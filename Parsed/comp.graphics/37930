From Ari Suutari Subject Any graphics packages available for AIX Does anybody know if there are any good graphics packages available for IBM RS AIX I'm looking for something like DEC's GKS or Hewlett Packards Starbase both of which have reasonably good support for different output devices like plotters terminals X I have tried also xgks from distribution and IBM's implementation of Both of them work but we require more output devices than just X Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and I am not expecting for any good solutions from Ari Ari Suutari Carelcomp Oy Lappeenranta FINLAND
