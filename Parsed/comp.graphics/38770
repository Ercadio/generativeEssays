From David K Shute Subject Re Rumours about DO John Munsch writes In article loT rAPNBh h viamar UUCP rutgers viamar kmembry writes Read Issue of Wired Magazine It has a long article on the hype of DO I've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how great it is, but never show any pictures of the output or at least pictures that one can understand Gamepro magazine published pictures a few months ago and Computer Chronicles a program that is syndicated to public tv stations around the nation spent several minutes on it when it was shown at CES It was very impressive what it can do in real time John Munsch The April edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on DO which includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some indication from the people at DO as to where they intend to go and in what stages MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound engineering community The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between two Graphics Animation processors bit bus , a bit RISC processor with math co processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion port where DO hangs its double fast CD player , Mb DRAM, an optional video port for editing video and on the outbound side MB VRAM to Video Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain They promise Red Book CD quality audio, full fps video and a future connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and methods discussed here The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does cover the other machines mentioned in this thread I come from the PC TCP IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to the educated consumer DO seems to have the right business partners to make this happen Hope this helps David Shute EMAIL
