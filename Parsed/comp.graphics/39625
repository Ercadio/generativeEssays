From Subject on a I was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at NIH with a database that included images in While I have not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call an X viewer I figure that the majority of the users here are not in an environment instead using DOS and MS With Kermit supporting emulation for graphics display does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a image It would be of more use to the local population to plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of XView or XLoadImage
