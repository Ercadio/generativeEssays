Solids description formats EEC's ESPRIT project CAD I CAD Interfaces has developed a neutral file format for transfer of CAD data curves surfaces and solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA Computer Aided Analysis an CAM Computer Aided Manufacturing IGES now tries to define a standard to tranfer solid models Brep and The current standard number is ANSI For documentation you might want to contact Nancy Flower at NCGA Technical Services and Standards and the cost is This standard is not available in electronic PDES STEP This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only the geometrical information but also for things like FEM The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and You can get more information about PDES by sending mail to and putting the line send index in the body NOT the Subject area of the The people at Rutherford Appleton are also working on STEP tools they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser both available in source form and for free for research Soon they will also have an EXPRESS based database For the tools contact Mike Mead Phone FAX x e mail or mcsun uknet rlinf mm or mm NSFnet End of Part of the Resource Listing Nick
