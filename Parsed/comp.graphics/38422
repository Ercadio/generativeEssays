From David Watson Subject Re Sphere from points In article qkgbuINN , Edward Bolson writes Given points non coplanar , how does one find the sphere, that is, center and radius, exactly fitting those points Finding the circumcenter of a tetrahedron is discussed on page in CONTOURING A guide to the analysis and display of spatial data, by Dave Watson, Pergamon Press, , ISBN , p Each pair of tetrahedral vertices define a plane which is a perpendicular bisector of the line between that pair Express each plane in the form Ax By Cz D and solve the set of simultaneous equations from any three of those planes that have a vertex in common all vertices are used The solution is the circumcenter Dave Watson Internet Department of Mathematics The University of Western Australia Tel Nedlands, WA Australia FAX
