From C Lee Subject Re Crimson Was Kubota Announcement In article kiki PROBLEM WITH INEWS GATEWAY FILE Keith Baccki writes C Lee wrote Did you say DEC Alpha Upgrade path from xx replace Upgrade path from VAX x to Alpha replace the system Not totally fair you haven't mentioned the DECstation series I think if SGI made CISC mainframes they wouldn't provide an upgrade path to an Onyx I agree with you about the upgrade path but I think I was fair The original posting complained about SGI coming out with newer and better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and that DEC did On statement , I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product market position share In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system And the particular system he was complaining about was in computer lifetimes relatively old On statement , I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry average , and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line Are they going to abandon it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R 's and TFP's and R 's
