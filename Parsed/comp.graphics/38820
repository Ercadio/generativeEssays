From Chris Lilley Subject Re XV problems In article r iv , Kouhia Juhana writes Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup Here is some text users of XV might find interesting I have also minor ideas for bit XV, e mail me for them Deleted for space basically complaints that xv is an bit program and that making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates In reverse order Try clicking in the auto apply box to switch it off Then make your mods Then click on apply There is no problem as stated it has already been solved if you look carefully Yes XV is an bit program This is not a bug You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes crop, scale etc Clearly the program must save out the altered image else all your work would be thrown away So yes it saves out bit images of course XV can import bit images and quantises them down to bits This is a handy facility, not a bug How would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated If you want to do colour editing on a bit image, you need much more powerfull software which is readily available commercially And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth Again, this is not a bug It is a way of saving disk space Later, Chris Lilley Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK M PL Internet C C L Voice Fax Janet C C L
