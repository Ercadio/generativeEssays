From Kenneth Sloan Subject Re Surface normal orientations In article Stephen Pietrowicz writes How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a set of points edges and faces Look for edge Consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one If p q is an edge then q p should not If both p q and q p appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that This is Assuming that you have an otherwise acceptable surface you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that pick an edge p q and mark it as OK for each face F containing this edge if more than oops make sure that all edges in F are consistent the Face should be p q q r r s s t t p Flip those which are Mark all of the edges in F as OK and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially inconsistencies don't let the queue have both p q and q p remove an edge from the queue and go to If a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you If step finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you Otherwise when done all of the edges will be Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or Deciding which way is OUT is left as an Kenneth Sloan Computer and Information Sciences University of Alabama at Birmingham Campbell Hall UAB Station FAX Birmingham AL
