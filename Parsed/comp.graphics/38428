From Lawrence D'Oliveiro Waikato University Subject Re Rumours about In article Ricardo Hernandez Muchado writes In article Sean McMains writes Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an earlier post is plain old Quicktime with the Compact Video I've seen digitized video some of Apple's early commercials to be precise running on a Centris at about very nicely bit color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC processor should be able to approach full screen full motion animation though as you've implied the processor will be taxed more with highly dynamic Sean I don't want to get into a 'mini war' by what I am going to say but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris you'll see why please no flames I reserve those for I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a booth I walked by and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime I think the quicktime they were using was the old one That is in fact the current version it only came out in December They digitized a guy talking there in It played back quite nicely and in real The guy then expanded the window resized to by in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't or about It dropped to like Then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to Then I asked him what Mac he was He was using a Quadra don't know what model to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory My test movie was created at resolution it wasn't being scaled Scaling was a very CPU intensive operation with the original QuickTime the current version has optimizations for ratios like but even so I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as with playing back an actual I haven't done any numerical measurements for scaled Lawrence D'Oliveiro fone Computer Services Dept fax University of Waikato electric mail Hamilton New Zealand ' S ' E GMT
