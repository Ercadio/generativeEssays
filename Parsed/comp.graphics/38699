From The Man behind The Curtain Subject Views on isomorphic perspectives I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective similar to that used in Basically you look into a room that looks similar to the following xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral Since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hard coded for a particular In my case wall two's rising edge has a slope of I'm also using Mode X I've run into two problems I'm sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions The routines for drawing walls were trivial but when I ran a packed planar image through them I was dismayed by the I'm now considered some anti aliasing routines speed is not really necessary Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden Wall presents a problem the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape Currently I take and produce Line follows the Line is directly under line Line moves up a line and left Line is under line This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled But it causes Has anyone come up with a better way Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z Locations are stored in x y z For those of you who noticed the top lines of wall and wall are parallel with its bottom This is why there appears to be an optical illusion it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood There are no vanishing This simplifies the drawing code for objects which don't have to change size as they move about in the room I've decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective Hopefully the context of the picture chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual Thanks in advance for any Till next time o o V o V email Sam Inala V
