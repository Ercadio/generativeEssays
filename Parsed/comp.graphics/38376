the general purpose packages I've heard of besides what TerraMar SIPS was written for AVIRIS I'm not sure how general purpose it You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and I have another piece of software PCW that does PC and Walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components I've used it on megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best speed you need an external DSP It will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to That's a freebie if you want it My favorite is IDL Interactive Data Language from Research Systems IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely Its programming language is very strong and easy very Pascal It handles the number crunching very well Personally I like doing the number crunching with IDL on the VAX or Mathematica Igor or even Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy then bringing it over to NIH Image for the imaging I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn't handle and the speed and ease of use compared to IRAF was By the way it's mostly astronomical image processing which I've been This means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing Then for example taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the

Information Systems software GRASS Geographic Resource Analysis Support System of the US Army Construction Engineering Research Lab CERL It is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing Many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it's public domain and can be obtained through the internet for GRASS runs in Unix and is written in The source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass You then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with I would recommend GRASS for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited GRASS is not very user friendly compared to Macintosh A first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel in Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS This gentleman has used the GRASS software and developed multi spectral bands volumetric rendering full color on Suns and It was a really effective Vexcel currently has a contract to map part of Venus and convert the Magellan radar data into contour You can call them at or email care of Host Configuration Requirements If you are willing to run A UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite GRASS is public domain and can run on a high end PC under It is raster based has some image processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment I have used GRASS on a SUN workstation and found it easy to It is best of course for data that are well represented in raster grid cell Availability CERL's Office of Grass Integration OGI maintains an ftp server Mail regarding this site should be addressed to This location

Configuration Requirements It runs on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to PC and possibly a Sun PCI A company called PCI out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I The software is available in versions for MS DOS Unix workstations among them HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platforms by I use the VMS The PCI software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI database disk The Tape I O package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file this is the only package I use or know much Other packages can display data from the PCI database to one or another of several PCI supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer an Epson type dot matrix graphics You might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specified operations multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and God only knows what all else there's a I don't have and don't use these so can't say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default Some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of The standard PCI environment contains a scripting language very similar to IBM PC BASIC but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility In VMS I can also invoke utilities independently from a DCL command There's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the PCI data structures database file parameter file The PCI software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as For instance the Tape I O package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry's format would probably I haven't tried handle Targa and so Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start It's worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information I observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the PCI database I believe that on workstations the built in display is On VAX systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name Gould Deanza seems to come to mind One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT Q Q bus bit DirectColor display PCI software COULD be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users those for whom a Mac PC largely doesn't suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time It's probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which does a LOT of its land resource management via remote sensing I believe the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager Back in JPL developed something called SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager which got a fair amount of use at the That was designed for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer which uses much larger Spam does none of these things rectification classification PC and IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching Spam is aimed at spectral identification and The original Spam uses X or SunView to The AVIRIS version may require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame I can refer you to people if you're PCW requires X for MAP II Among the Mac GIS systems MAP II is distributed by John CLRview CLRview is a dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from CAD and GIS It supports the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF TIN DEM Lattices and Arc Info Coverages among CLRview can be obtained from in the directory pub sgi Contact Rodney Hoinkes Head of
