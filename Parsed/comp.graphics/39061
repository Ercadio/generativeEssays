From justin sydney DIALix oz au Justin Sullivan Subject Re LCD VGA display In trevorC C Sandy Santra writes Mike Mattone wrote I've only had the computer for about months Only That's a long time Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display I think months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable If you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the machine to last longer before something went wrong but that's a moot point, perhaps Maybe I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since which is still used daily and the screen on that is fine The only problem it has and ever has had is the arm of the screen is sorta lose and if you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it round a bit But other than that, it's been perfect So what's that, about um, months Justin Sullivan System Administrator DIALix Services Sydney Modem Ph Perth
