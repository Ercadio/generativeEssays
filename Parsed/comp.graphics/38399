From M J Williams Subject Re Rumours about DO In article BD Robert C Barris writes We got to see the unit displaying full screen movies using the CompactVideo codec which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft and a very high frame rate to boot like fps Acorn Replay running on a MHz ARM processor the ARM is about slower than the ARM does this in software off a standard CD ROM bit colour at about the same resolution so what if the computer only has bit colour support, real time dithering too The D O is supposed to have a couple of DSPs the ARM being used for housekeeping I'm not sure how a Centris MHz stacks up against the MHz ARM in the DO box Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much A MHz ARM xx should clock around ARM MIPS, say flat out Depends really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM x or ARM xx the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with slower memory I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after graduation Mike PS Don't pay heed to what reps from Philips say if the D O doesn't beat the pants off DI then I'll eat this postscript Michael Williams Part II Computer Science Tripos MJW University of Cambridge Cymdeithas Genedlaethol Traddodiad Troi Teigrod Mwythus Ben I Waered
