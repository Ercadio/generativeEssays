From Chris Lilley Subject Oh make up your mind was Re XV problems In article Kouhia Juhana writes In article writes In article Kouhia Juhana writes I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary Think about what you are saying The bit image is quantised down to bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary You then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette I suppose you don't know what about we have We discussed about error s in XV which shows images only as and my suggestion above works perfectly with Look be First you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an bit program as some sort of So I post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like So you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was I have misunderstood Now you are saying We discussed about error s in XV which shows images only as If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV that is there must be a colormap The problems you present are exist anyway and I didn't tried to solve them at all because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first Eh Sorry I don't understand what you are saying I am aware that English is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats Gamma and color corrections are easily done to image as I There's no need make tricks from quantized image back to bit Yes as I originally said global changes are easily But this statement contradicts what you said earlier I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the How would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more Ok you're writing about situation that user want edit images as and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a No I don't think so You were talking about loading a bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the bit file when you exit Xv lets you edit individual Where is this sudden jumping off the topic My solution doesn't work because there's no colormap withing real image Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a bit file you see user see image going back to is I do not understand what this statement is supposed to About changing individual colors in quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the What are you saying XV allows this feature but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type Ah now we see thew problem First you want to extend xv to allow editing of bit previews of bit Then I point out problems with Now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem Moreover XV is not a paint program you can only make those global Not sure what you are saying Certainly one can make local In full XV changing individual colors sounds like paint program If person have screen there's need for tricks to get the original image Because user don't see full image there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized To select indiavidual color there could be cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from Yes that is one possible I would find a program that took such an approach clumsy Ok I don't have thought very much painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make Not to mention painting program in Well here we agree you have not thought it through very You don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the OK we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one Yes What is was wrong with xv It saved quantized rasterized images as jpegs jpeg is not designed for As I said in the last post JPEG is a compression It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against I fail to see what the problem You have not proposed any workable Also human expect that will be saved as image Speak for You are the only person I have met or spoken to who having quantised a bit image down to bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the bit image Perhaps that is why you yused the singular say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the Look next time you import a bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the bit XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original bit You are the only person who claims this is So XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design Is a design error the same as a bug Read my XV is a program for viewing and modifying bit It lets you import other It shows I would say a good deal of thought about the human And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed It makes no false I have heard XV were designed first for images files but it were not good idea to take full images without making major change to the original If you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post So far you have not done So even all screen images are the processed images and saved images could have been very easily instead of Argh After all this a comment like Very easily' OK go ahead and code it if it is so Or alternatively look up the terms import' and 'non reversible transformation' Before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn't solve the Americans the lift is just an example I think this is a bit of an What you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states and mistakenly pressed the down button to go Everyone else had no Now you are trying to sue the Well my text may be a bit hard reading you bet hopefully you suggeeded to read Leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself admit which is the same in any Go think some Chris Lilley Technical
