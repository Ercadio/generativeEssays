From David Hawks Subject Turning photographic images into thermal print and or negatives I do not know if I am hitting the right news groups or not, any help in the right direction is more than welcome I need help finding a company that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop and turn them into thermal prints or negatives I am looking for a place as close to North Carolina as possible The images will be created on a Macintosh Quadra running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps M cartridges The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a dpi scanner then modified corrected by Adobe Photoshop If anyone could help me or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you use and or any peripherals or software It seemed the Quadra would be my best bet to modify photographic images I am planning on buying a Quadra with Megs of RAM, a Meg Hard Drive, a dpi scanner, Sony monitor and a Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM I am new to computers and any advice would be great David at or
