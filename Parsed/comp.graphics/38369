From Technically Sweet Subject What is reverse or negative video I'm interested in simulating reverse or negative color video What is the transform Is it a simple reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space Is it a manipulation in the YUV color space How is it related to solarization If you want to see something truly wild turn on the reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped and point it at the This creates a chaotic dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along rotation zoom focus Very very surprising and I'd like to write a simulation of this effect without analog Thanks for any info you may Please e mail any info to I'll post a Thanks Lance Norskog Data is not information is not knowledge is not
