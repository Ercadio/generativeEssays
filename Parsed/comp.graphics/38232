From Catherine Craig Subject Re Trying to view POV files In article A ednobles sacam OREN ORTN EDU Edward d Nobles writes I've been trying to view tga files created in POVRAY I have the Diamond SpeedStar Video board not the X So far I can convert them to jpeg using cjpeg and view them with CVIEW but that only displays bit color I'm looking for some way to convert and or view them in bit Just want to see the darn things in real color Thanks, Jim Nobles The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC You'll want version or later x is current It allows you to view in and bit modes It really is QUITE nice Now, for a return question Do you run Windows If so, what are the dates on your drivers The newest ones I can find are from around My problem is they conflict with Star Trek After Dark, and other things as well I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs Anyone out there have info on newer SS NOT X drivers for windows or OS Thanks, Justin
