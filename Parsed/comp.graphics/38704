From SHERRY ROBERT MICH Subject Re SCF files, help needed From article A , by I've got an old demo disk that I need to view It was made using RIX Softworks The files on the two diskette set end with scf The demo was VGA resolution colors , but I don't know the spatial resolution According to my ColoRIX manual SCF files are x x First problem When I try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that cut across horizontally the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the screen The bars are about inch wide Other than this, the demo the animation part seems to be running fine Second problem I can't find any graphics program that will open and display these files I have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention scf files You may try VPIC, I think it handles the color RIX files OK Rob Sherry
