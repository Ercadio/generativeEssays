From Amjad A Soomro Subject Gamma Law Correction Hi I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video It is known that the display response of tubes is non linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma I am not certain if these non linearities are Gamma corrected before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct Also if grey levels for example are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for gamma errrors Your response is much Amjad Soomro CCS Computer Science Center of Maryland at College Park email
