> the gl file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .pic or .clp files), fonts, and a .txt file
that tells the grasp animation system how to display it. gl stands
for grasp library. there is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures faq. there are freely distributable viewers for gl files, and they are usually
named grasprt?.exe (replace the ? with a version digit or letter). most
gl files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the cga, ega, or vga adapters on pcs. i think that there are some
copies of grasprt available by anonymous ftp (i know that i got one there
a long time ago). good luck jack -- == jack stephenson main e-mail: ==
