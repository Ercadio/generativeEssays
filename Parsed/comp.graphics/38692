From Louis Gonzalez Subject SPHINX Satellite Image Processing under SPHINX Sphinx is a user friendly state of the art image processing and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance computer platforms operating UNIX and the X Window It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing Intuitive Graphic Interface Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop up menus and point and click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing Image Format Compatibility Using smart read write functions Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit integer or real data Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk Image Analysis Processing For image and pixel analysis the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations such as Fourier transforms convolution product or principal component An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental Satellite Spectra Orbit Analysis Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites GOES METEOSAT NOAA Spot The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles warping orbit simulation and D image Easy External Program Interfacing Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface Quick Quality Presentation Sphinx rapidly displays manipulates and enhances high resolution multispectral images and color Using six bit image planes and one graphics plane the package conveniently combines color images graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and Sphinx's D and D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images such as histograms and radial The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation external graphics importing mosaic what else Software Support Development Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique LOA of the Universite de Lille The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory Centre National de Recherche Scientifique CNRS and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales CNES At LOA Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer The package which features on line help is supported by an Internet address through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without Performance Tested CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data collected during the upcoming ADEOS POLDER satellite Today the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement Ecole Normale Superieure Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale Laboratoire de Meteorologie A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT anonymous bin cd SPHINX get ALL IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE HOWEVER THE VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO WORK IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING SPHINX SEND US YOUR EMAIL AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE THE SOFTWARE IS CHANGING WITH USER SUGGESTIONS WE WILL APPRECIATE YOUR
