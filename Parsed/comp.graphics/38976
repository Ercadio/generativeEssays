From rajsnr S N Rajesh Subject Looking for a job as a Software Engineer I am not sure that I am supposed to post this mail However during the last year while I was involved in developing graphical user interface GUI applications I have enjoyed being personally part of this news group wherin I got some interesting information which helped me in my I am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would make time to look at WestGate Hall ISU Ames IA April Dear Prospective Employer I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software design and development in which I can utilize my experience in hardware C C programming graphical user interface GUI operating systems and computer I received my Bachelors of Engineering BE degree in Electronics Engineering in and a degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec from Iowa State Currently I am enrolled in a in Computer Engineering at Iowa State During my Masters program as a research assistant since Jan I have published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability to learn new concepts I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and have extensive experience programming in C C Fortran and Assembly I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix Ultrix and MS I am familiar with Motif X programming and currently as a research assistant am involved in graphical user interface GUI design using the multiplatform GUI toolkit XVT My experiences also include areas such as operating systems and computer networks through course work and I was involved in the study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating I have also been involved in many TCP IP programming projects in computer While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise I have also learned a lot about time In my program I have maintained a grade average worked hours per week and have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular My software experiences along with my hardware background Electronics Engineering would be very helpful in my career goals as a software I request that my qualifications may kindly be I would like to have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career I am eager to hear from you Sincerely Rajesh RESUME RAJESH Work Residence Coover
