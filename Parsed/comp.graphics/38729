From Toby Freeman TJF Subject Re CorelDraw BITMAP to SCODAL In article writes Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in but if you try to export in SCODAL with a bitmap it will say something like cannot anyone out there knows a way around this I am all I think one not ideal solution is to use the tracing utility can't remember the name sorry included in the Corel Draw s w It can convert bitmaps to Corel art These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the Result the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem BUT the slight problem with this which makes the solution less than idea is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short the SCODAL taking much longer to The obvious solution is time consuming stripping out the extra points by hand using OUCH I've done it a few times was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad Jeff Lyall As I say if you don't mind the problems go via the BITMAP COREL VIA TRACE HAND TRIMMING USING COREL COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC VIA IMPORT SCODAL Cheers Toby Toby Freeman Glasgow University
