From Ferdinand Oeinck Subject Re detecting double points in bezier curves John Renner writes In article capelli Ron Ca In Ferdinand Oeinck writes I'm looking for any information on detecting and or calculating a double point and or cusp in a bezier See Maureen Stone and Tony DeRose A Geometric Characterization of Parametric Cubic Curves ACM TOG vol no July I've used that reference and found that I needed to go to their original tech report Maureen Stone and Tony DeRose Characterizing Cubic Bezier Curves Xerox EDL December First thanks to all who replied to my original I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied with the I needed it for my bezier curve approximation In some cases generating offset curves loops can I now have a fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a Although I did not follow the article above The check if the fourth control point lies in the the loop area which is bounded by two parabolas and one ellips is too Instead I enlarged the loop area and surrounded it by for straight The check is now simple and fast and my approximation routine never ever outputs self intersecting bezier curves again
