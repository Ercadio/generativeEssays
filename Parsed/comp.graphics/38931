From Tony Lau Subject D widget wish list I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing D interactive applications what types of D widgets you would like to have in your applications A D widget is usually located in the same scene as other D objects of the application It may let you manipulate application data, the camera, D objects in the scene and so on, or view the status of the application or D objects via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or do whatever I missed but you think is possible For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball shown as a partially transparent sphere super imposed on the object to be rotated A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to objects The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis Please e mail me or post your opinions on D interaction The information I gathered will help me design a D UI construction tool Your help is very much appreciated Tony Lau M Sc Student Dept of Computer Science
