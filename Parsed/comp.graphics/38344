From Tiang Subject Re A Book I found graphics Locks writes Hello, I happened to spot an excellent book in a bookstore about days ago, though It is in C and assembly It teaches you the assembly as it goes along so if you're like me and have no assembler experience, don't worry It has almost everything that I wanted to know and has WORKING code Rod Covlin I just bought a copy I can't disagree that it is a very good book But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature described in this book but NOT in x x or x x mode It is easy to accomodate all the pixel descriptor or color attributes in those modes into A AFFFFF, but not in x x which is what I am interested in I haven't finish the book but I affraid the author didn't talk much about this mode or other SVGA modes If anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics manupulation scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff please send me mail Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome Thanks in advance Tiang T Foo Tiang T Foo
