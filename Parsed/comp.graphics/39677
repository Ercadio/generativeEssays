from david max subject needed non interactive gif cropper for pc i have a group of gif images that each contain 6 small images in the same place on all the images. i need a program to crop out the
small images to a new gif file. all the programs i can find make me
use the mouse or keyboard to define the cropping coordinates. is there
a program out there for a pc that can take the crop coordinates on
the command line? reply to: (david max)
