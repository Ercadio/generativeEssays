From Subject Kubota Kenai Denali specs Okay I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai Denali systems that I will post a summary of their I haven't actually used one or seen one so take the specs with a grain of I'd like to see an independent review of one against say an SGI Indigo Extreme or Basically the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF DEC's and will likely run Windows NT in the They are binary compatible with Digital's OSF Alpha AXP Denali is their graphics subsystem which is upgradable in the field by simply adding transformation engines The two main Kenai machines are the Imaging and Graphics Workstation and the Imaging and Graphics CPU DEC Alpha AXP DEC Alpha AXP On chip cache Onboard cache Word Size bit bit Memory initial Memory future GRAPHICS Transform Modules Frame Buffer Modules Frame Buffer double buffered double buffered Z buffer bit bit Alpha stencil bit bit Stereo support yes yes Other both machines will double buffer or do stereo output per Both have an auxiliary video output that is RS NTSC and PAL STORAGE Internal fixed Internal removable Max capacity GB IO Both have TurboChannel sec SCSI Ethernet and FDDI APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES Both have libraries for Xlib Motif MIT PEXlib DEC PEXlib DEC PHIGS and GL Okay now the real The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as The Denali comes in three models the E P and They use a DECchip superscalar RISC processor at Their capabilities are as follows E P V Vectors Vectors Vectors Vectors Triangles Triangles pixel flat shaded connected pixel Gouraud shaded connected pixel pixel wide anti aliased connected pixel Gouraud shaded Z buffered strip pixel texture mapped point sampled IMAGE PROCESSING Cine loop bit s Mp s Mp s Cine loop bit Mp s Mp s Mp s Cine loop bit Mp s Mp s Mp s Contrast stretching Mp s Mp s Mp s Bilinear zoom Mp s Mp s Mp s Trilinear interp Mvoxels s Mvoxels s Lookup table bit to Trilinear interpolation bit voxels CONFIGURATIONS Frame Buffer Modules Transform Engine As you can see these are pretty powerful workstations and the best part is the I would recommend that you call Kubota for more Their number is I'm sure they'll send you an information you may Oh some prices Low end Kenai E Series w TEM and FBM dollars Kenai E Series w TEM and FBM dollars High end Kenai V Series w TEM and FBM dollars Kenai V Series w TEM and FBM dollars If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or something I would appreciate Hope this helps someone out there Brian PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any Hell I thought they made tractors or
