From Subject Kubota Kenai Denali specs Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai Denali systems that I will post a summary of their capabilities I haven't actually used one or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt I'd like to see an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or something Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF DEC's and will likely run Windows NT in the future They are binary compatible with Digital's OSF Alpha AXP implementation Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding transformation engines The two main Kenai machines are the Imaging and D Graphics Workstation and the Imaging and D Graphics Workstation CPU DEC Alpha AXP MHz DEC Alpha AXP MHz On chip cache k k k k Onboard cache K K Word Size bit bit Memory initial MB MB Memory future MB GB SPECMARK SPECINT SPECFP GRAPHICS Transform Modules Frame Buffer Modules , , , , Frame Buffer x x bit x x bit double buffered double buffered Z buffer bit bit Alpha stencil bit bit Stereo support yes yes Other both machines will double buffer or do stereo output per window Both have an auxiliary video output that is RS A, NTSC, and PAL STORAGE Internal fixed Internal removable Max capacity GB GB IO Both have TurboChannel MB sec, SCSI , Ethernet, and FDDI APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES Both have libraries for Xlib, Motif, MIT PEXlib, DEC PEXlib DEC PHIGS, and GL Okay, now the real stuff The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as Denali The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V They use a DECchip superscalar RISC processor at MHz Their capabilities are as follows E P V D Vectors K K K D Vectors K K K D Vectors K K K D Vectors K K K D Triangles, K K K D Triangles, K K K pixel, flat shaded, connected pixel, Gouraud shaded, connected pixel, pixel wide, anti aliased, connected pixel, Gouraud shaded, Z buffered, strip pixel, texture mapped, persp , point sampled IMAGE PROCESSING Cine loop bit Mp s Mp s Mp s Cine loop bit Mp s Mp s Mp s Cine loop bit Mp s Mp s Mp s Contrast stretching Mp s Mp s Mp s Bilinear zoom Mp s Mp s Mp s Trilinear interp Mvoxels s Mvoxels s Lookup table , bit to Trilinear interpolation, bit voxels CONFIGURATIONS Frame Buffer Modules Transform Engine Mod As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part is the pricing I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information Their number is I'm sure they'll send you an information you may want Oh, some prices Low end Kenai , E Series w TEM and FBM , dollars U S Kenai , E Series w TEM and FBM , dollars U S High end Kenai , V Series w TEM and FBM , dollars U S Kenai , V Series w TEM and FBM , dollars U S If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or something I would appreciate it Hope this helps someone out there, Brian PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any way Hell, I thought they made tractors or something
