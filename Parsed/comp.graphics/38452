From Sean McMains Subject Re Rumours about DO First off Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for further enhancements to the Motorola line, rather than meted out to another company Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner In article A Ricardo Hernandez Muchado, writes Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini war' by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, you'll see why please, no flames, I reserve those for c s m a I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there I walked by, and they were showing real time video capture using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies I think the quicktime they were using was the old one Version of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of the software The older version is , and is on the horizon in the not too distant future They digitized a guy talking there in x xx something It played back quite nicely and in real time The guy then expanded the window resized to x by xx in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't fps or about fps anymore It dropped to like fps Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to fps Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies Apparently the process of expanding each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processor intensive There are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to x size or increase to x size, performance suffers dramatically Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra don't know what model, to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII He lied Quicktime is very CPU dependent He was probably confused by the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the same amount of time on any machine However, an LC will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble And this wasn't even from the hardisk This was from memory Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was I was using was One of the new codecs in v allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version could handle The Centris I saw was a plain vanilla, with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player, the QT player Apple includes with the software Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this No problem it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the things it does as well as it can Sean McMains Check out the Gopher Phone University of North Texas New Bands Info server Fax P O Box at seanmac acs unt edu E Mail Denton TX McM
