from kevin martin subject re xv under ms dos in no e mail writes do somenone know the solution to run xv ??? any help would be apprecied.. i would guess that it requires x, almost certainly dv/x, which commonly
uses the go32 (djgpp) setup for its programs. if you don't have dv/x
running, you can't get anything which requires interfacing with x. -- kevin martin "i gotta get me another hat."
