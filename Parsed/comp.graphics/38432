From Alan Christiansen Subject Re Sphere from points Steve Worley writes Edward Bolson writes Boy this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ Given points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is center and radius exactly fitting those points I know how to do it for a circle from points but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in I have checked some geometry books Graphics Gems and Farin but am still at a loss Please have mercy on me and provide the solution It's not a bad question I don't have any refs that list this algorithm But thinking about it a bit it shouldn't be too Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on you say you have this algorithm already Find the center of this The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the Repeat with the unused point and two of the original This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's Their interection is the center of the the radius is easy to compute it's just the distance from the center to any of the original I'll leave the math to you but this is a workable Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface Similarly colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems When determining which plane the points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite When intersecting the two lines there are possibilities they are the same line the points were on a planar circle they are different lines but There is a sphere of in This last case can be achieved with colinier points and any point by taking the point and pairs of the first parallel lines will be produced it can also be achieved by If all points are coplanar but are not on one It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the points are The algorithm always fails when the points are points being colinear coplanar Testing if the point is coplanar when the plane of the first points has been found is An alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the Three pairs will form three planes intersecting at a This might be easier to Steve
