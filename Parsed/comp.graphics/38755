from jeff bulf subject re fractal compression in article , i rachmat writes hi can anybody give me book or reference title to give me a start at |> fractal image compression technique. helps will be appreciated... thanx for better worse, the source on this on is michael barnsley. his article
in the science of fractal images (peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling
intro. barnsley's book fractals everywhere is a more thorough treatment.
the book covers iterated function systems in general, and their application
to image compression is clear from the text.
