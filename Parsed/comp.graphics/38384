From Arno Schaefer Subject Re CView answers In article C LErr J , Bryan Woodworth writes In A Sean Gum writes A stupid question, but what will CView run on and where can I get it I am still in need of a GIF viewer for Linux Without X Windows Thanks Ho boy There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do any other graphics in Linux without X windows I love Linux because it is so easy to learn You want text Okay Use Linux You want text AND graphics Use Linux with X windows Simple Painless REQUIRED to have X Windows if you want graphics This includes fancy word processors like doc, image viewers like xv, etc Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct Remember the VGALIB package that comes with Linux SLS It will switch to VGA x x mode without Xwindows So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux However I don't think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in x is not very nice Best Regards, Arno Arno Schaefer ENSIMAG, e Annee Email Tel
