From HINTZE MATTHEW Subject Re Diamond Stelth any good I bought the diamond stealth a few months it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia It runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very The only thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above Its qualit in between and million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software but Im not so sure about the excelerator I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from ROM at startup I think because I have never had to load it for or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at gromi HINTMATT
