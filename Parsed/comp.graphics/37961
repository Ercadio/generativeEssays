From Hugh Johnson Subject Re QuickTime movie available In article I wrote I've used the recently released Macintosh application MPEG to QuickTime to convert the excellent MPEG into a QuickTime While anyone who would want this movie is perfectly able to convert it themselves I thought I'd let the net know that I'd be glad to mail copies of mine The movie conversion took close to SIX HOURS on my poor little IIcx in other words unless you've got a Quadra you might not want to tie up your machine in converting this The movie is a fast fly through of a fractal generated canyon The movie is seconds long and uses the compact video compressor QuickTime The movie looks okay on bit displays and looks absolutely awesome on and bit I'd be happy to mail this movie to the first or so people who ask for The only caveat is you need to be able to receive a nine megabyte mail message the movie was stuff it'ed down to seven megs but binhex ruined that party If more then people want this movie then it's just more evidence that the net needs a dedicated QuickTime FTP archive C'mon someone's gotta have a spare drive out Okay I've received a whole lot of requests for the movie so for simplicity's sake I can't mail out any more than I've already received as of EDT Tuesday Maybe it'll pop up on a site sooner or Hugh Johnson Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Welcome to Troy New York USA
