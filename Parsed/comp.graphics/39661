From Chuck McKinley Subject Ray Bezier Intersection Problem If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica Maple I would like to ask you for the solution to the following I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified symbolic Is there a FTP able package out there that can handle such beasts I would like to solve the following ray Bezier patch intersection for the scalar constant t in P t V Q u w origin point in dir vector in terms of only P V P and various scalars origin dir i j i j where T Q u w U N B M W n n n n U u u u u u u u u u in my particular case n n n n T W w w w w w w T w w w in my particular case T N M for my particular case B P P P P control points in space P P P P P P P P P P P P Thanx
