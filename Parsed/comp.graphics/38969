From Stephen Peter Subject Windows BMP something wanted G'Day All, I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also I've seen Alchemy for DOS and some windows image viewers which can save an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer Any help would be apprieciated cheers Stephen S Peter unsw EDU AU Stephen Peter or EDU AU v School of Architecture, University of New South Wales, Australia Phone Fax Messages
