From Bob Fitzsimmons Subject Re VGA Graphics Library In article bill Bill Sheppard writes Many high end graphics cards come with C source code for doing basic graphics sorts of things change colors draw points lines polygons fills Does such a library exist for generic VGA graphics cards chips hopefully in the public domain This would be for the purpose of compiling under a non DOS operating system running on a standard I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library package to do PC VGA I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a non DOS kernel that needs to do some simple I'm not sure if reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something what do you think Cheers Bob Fitzsimmons
