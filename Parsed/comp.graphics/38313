From Edward Bolson Subject Sphere from points Boy this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ Given points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is center and radius exactly fitting those points I know how to do it for a circle from points but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in I have checked some geometry books Graphics Gems and Farin but am still at a loss Please have mercy on me and provide the solution Thanks Ed Ed Bolson University of Washington Cardiovascular Research preferred if you must
