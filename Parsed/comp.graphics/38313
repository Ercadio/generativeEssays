from edward bolson subject sphere from points boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an faq given points (non coplanar), how does one find the sphere, that is,
center and radius, exactly fitting those points? i know how to do it
for a circle (from 3 points), but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in 3-d. i have checked some
geometry books, graphics gems, and farin, but am still at a loss?
please have mercy on me and provide the solution? thanks,
