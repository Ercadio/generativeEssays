from chris lilley subject re coreldraw bitmap to scodal in article , writes does anyone know of software that will allow
>you to convert coreldraw (.cdr) files
>containing bitmaps to scodal, as this is the
>only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises. corel draw will do it; version 2 onwards. if you have version 1 perhaps an
