From Bram Subject Re bit graphics Howdy all, Wonko the Sane writes I was recently talking to a possible employer mine and he made a reference to a bit graphics computer image processing system I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that Anyway, he claimed it had bit color a bit alpha channel That's bits of info what could that possibly be for Specifically the bit color That's trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve Is this an anti aliasing thing Or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor Hmm bit aye Well, it beats a bit design for thee sake of ellegance bit means bits per primary colour The nr of colours is a bit misleading It makes more sense to see it as possible shades of pure red This might actually make some sense, since shades of red bit colours may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy and fast program code Take care, Bram Flying is a nack the trick is Bram Stolk to throw yourself at the ground, Dept of maths computer science and miss Douglas Adams University of Amsterdam No, I dont use ms winDOZE, I prefer Linux
