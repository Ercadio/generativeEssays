From ttknock Boss Hogg Subject POV animating In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little One is a C program that will perform a morph between any two points given the amount of frames for the And then it will write the points and the function translate rotate out to a Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a file at a given I had hoped this would let me do simple However I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation which could cause this However this occurs on objects that are not translated at Any help is
