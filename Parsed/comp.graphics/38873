From Peter Lee Subject Re QuickTime performance was Re Rumours about In article Lawrence D'Oliveiro Waikato University writes Path dime usc decwrl ldo From Lawrence D'Oliveiro Waikato University Newsgroups Date Apr GMT References Organization University of Waikato Hamilton New Zealand Lines Xref dime OK with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime the effects of scaling and so on I thought I'd do some more First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than The movie I had been using only had frames in it it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor I decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse I pulled out a copy of A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV a while About fifteen minutes into the movie there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space Specifically I digitized a portion of about seconds' duration zooming in on the rotating space I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only frames per second to give a total of I captured the raw footage at a resolution of pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris quarter size resolution from a PAL source I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor keeping the fps frame I created two versions of the movie one scaled to resolution the other at I used the default quality setting in Premiere and specified a key frame every ten I then ran the movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used for the results I'd been reporting Result a playback rate of over frames per That's right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test Just for fun I copied the movie to my external hard disk a Quantum and ran it from This time the playback rate was only about frames per Obviously the internal hard disk also a Quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the movie scaled to This time the playback speed was over Clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime in action not I'd try my tests with QuickTime but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System Unscaled the playback rate for the movie was over The other thing I tried was saving versions of the movie with preferred playback rates greater than and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback A preferred rate of fps didn't work too well the playback was very Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved fps with I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task A preferred rate of fps seemed to work fine I couldn't see any evidence of At fps I think I could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more Of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even Lawrence D'Oliveiro fone Computer Services Dept fax University of Waikato electric mail Hamilton New Zealand ' S ' E GMT I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take into account playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually or bit but other depths are of course possible type of scaling QT is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder playback window position MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default I'm not sure about Premiere Any combination of those can radically alter playback Image size is of course another Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the Peter Lee Peter Lee Software Conductor Specular International or H or W Beauty is bits deep plus eight bits of alpha channel
