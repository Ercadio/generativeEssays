From cs sbw Subject Re REAL D I heard a friend who just return from NAB from Las Vegas confirm that RealSoft will be releasing a Windows version of REAL D this summer He was told that the rendering speed on the DX isn't as fast as A However, he was also told that they are switching from Microsoft C to Watcom to gain more speed For people who is looking for a powerful D animation software for PC The wait shouldn't be too long Real D is absolutely the most powerful and flexible D package out there that sells for less than p s I heard a Indigo version is also under development
