From Zhao Subject Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an INTERACTIVE FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI Besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs such as text and vector support and the separation of text and The following is the relevant sections from the man Pre Release of May BIT NAME bit Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations DESCRIPTION bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on Silicon Graphics As a full color program bit handles images of both and color index in a natural and efficient As an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type or color index in any order and in any of the many built in styles of You can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you The SlideShow With the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen As an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and It keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into In addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions PostScript Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image will be read back and displayed Convolution using exter nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an FEATURES Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing is complete the processed image will be Current features include o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with the option of subpixel o Renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately such as into a PostScript file to take advantage of a higher printer Besides normal text strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in TeX alpha small beta produces Greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet o Presents graphically the histogram of an o Performs arbitrary to pixel The transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary Further the transformation can be applied to RGB channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of Many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished rather easily by to transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histograms of the o Places simple geometric figures SGFs arrows circles trian gles of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately PostScript file All SGFs can be scaled in x and y directions independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a circle o Performs edge In combination with image histograms and to transformation very accurate result can be o Performs histogram o Performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of arbitrary o Crops a rectangular portion of an o Cuts and pastes across o Magnifies any portion of an image by any o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between SlideShow o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities or as an intensity distance o Performs image type o Converts image o Smoothes an image Special convolution o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display o Modify an individual pixel's RGB o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power o Spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release SUPPORTED FORMATS o IRIS RGB native to SGI IRIS o JPEG JFIF format o CompuServ GIF o PNM Portable Any Map including PPM PGM and o XBM X Window Bitmap o TIFF o PostScript Write only Hardware requirements Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode including Where to get it anonymous ftp to pub bit where xxx is the version Current version is Read src for installation instructions after unpacking Acknowledgement JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version FORMS library developed by Mark Overmars is used for Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images The built in editing features will satisfy most of your editing In addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already So try it and you will like it As always any comments bug reports are
