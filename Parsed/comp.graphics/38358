From The Silent Assassin Subject Re Please Recommend D Graphics Library For Mac Robert G Carpenter writes Hi Netters, I'm building a CAD package and need a D graphics library that can handle some rudimentry tasks, such as hidden line removal, shading, animation, etc Can you please offer some recommendations It's really not that hard to do There are books out there which explain everything, and the basic D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and hidden line removal are pretty easy I wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source Also, Quickdraw has a lot of D functions built in, and Think pascal can access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well If you can find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be fast Libertarian, atheist, semi anarchal Techno Rat I define
