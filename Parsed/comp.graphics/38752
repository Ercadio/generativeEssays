from jerry m lineberry subject pov ray problem please help hello, i've recently had povray draw about 10 sample files. the problem is that
i accidently erased the command in my povray.def that made the image a targas
file. so now the files are the dump format. how do i fix these files with out
having to re-trace them? by fix i mean, turn them into targas. thanks in
advance. -jerry
