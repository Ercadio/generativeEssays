From Mark Morley Subject VGA Mode Routines Available Hi there I've made a VGA mode graphics library available via I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them They are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higher level They're intended more as an intro to mode programming a starting The library assumes a processor but it is trivial to modify it for a If enough people ask I'll make the mods and re post it as a different The routines are written in assembly TASM and are callable from They are fairly simple but I've found them to be very fast for my purposes anyway Routines are included to enter and exit mode define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with no transparent spots put a sprite image with see thru areas copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line as well as a C routine to load a color GIF image into a I also wrote a quick'n'dirty tm demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows The whole package is available on in pub dos It is zipped with pkzip It is completely in the public domain as far as I'm Do with it whatever you However it'd be nice to get credit where it's due and maybe an e mail telling me you like it if you don't like it don't bother Mark
