page There are other algorithms but this one works well and is fairly Implementations are included in most raster toolkits see item below A variant method is described in Graphics Gems Note that the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site as described Check out John Bradley's Diversity Algorithm which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the The ImageMagick package see section for where it is contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms but slower There's also an implementation of Wan Wong and Prusinkiewicz An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering Transactions on Mathematical Software June avialable as pub Graphics This code in modified form appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as Converting color into The NTSC formula is luminosity red green blue Quantizing grayscale to black The only reference you need for this stuff is Digital Halftoning Robert Ulichney MIT Press ISBN But before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the This is wrong because it leaves holes in the Instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the This method is quite general and can be used for any one to one D mapping not just You can add anti aliasing by doing sub pixel However there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit see below an implementation is also present in Reference A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation by Alan Paeth Graphics Interface ' Vancouver An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same An updated version of the rotation paper appears in Graphics Gems see section under the original Free image manipulation There are a number of toolkits for converting from one

Despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on read it if you want to know Converting between vector A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw to CGM or It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image This is not so for vector The basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles vary from one format to Except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector There is software for converting to and from CGM files on The contributor states that it runs on Unix MS Windows and possibly the A better more specific blurb would be most On the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from As far as I know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to Check the index on your nearest archive A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to For example some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a Also the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're But in general the answer is However if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be GNU ghostscript from the FSF current version includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF It implements essentially all of PostScript level and alot of Display PostScript and level How to get Pixar The various John Lasseter Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video You can order them from

within a planar Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the If the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem see Eric Haines' article in Glassner's ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the If the sum is pi the point is inside if the sum is the point is However this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite Code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the Ray Tracing News available from pub Graphics RTNews How to tessellate a One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into The base
