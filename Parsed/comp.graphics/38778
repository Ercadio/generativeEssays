there Quantizing bit images down to bits Find a copy of Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH ' Proceedings, page There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple Implementations are included in most raster toolkits see item below A variant method is described in Graphics Gems , p Note that the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site, as described above Check out John Bradley's Diversity Algorithm , which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual The ImageMagick package see section for where it is contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower There's also an implementation of Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering , Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol June, , pp avialable as princeton edu pub Graphics colorquant shar This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well Converting color into grayscale The NTSC formula is luminosity red green blue Quantizing grayscale to black white The only reference you need for this stuff is Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press , ISBN But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item below All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w conversion Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source This method is quite general, and can be used for any one to one D mapping, not just rotation You can add anti aliasing by doing sub pixel sampling However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit see below an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS Reference A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation , by Alan Paeth Graphics Interface ' Vancouver An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal An updated version of the rotation paper appears in Graphics Gems see section under the original title Free image manipulation software There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image

are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message See item below for details on some Also, the newsgroup alt graphics pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this You may find useful information there Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc You almost certainly don't need these Read the above item on free image manipulation software Get one or more of these packages and look through them Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof cs rice edu in directory pub graphics formats These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct This archive includes pixel formats, and two and three dimensional object formats The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall will apparently no longer be maintaining it A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol The latest version exists at ftp ncsa uiuc edu in misc file formats graphics formats Apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System It's a file format most often used in astronomy Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci astro fits read it if you want to know more Converting between vector formats A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats This is not so for vector formats The basic objects circles, ellipses, drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles, etc vary from one format to another Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp psc edu The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS Windows, and possibly the Mac A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp sources misc Check the index on your nearest archive site A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X bitmap For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever But in general, the answer is no However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial GNU ghostscript from the FSF current version includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter It implements essentially all of PostScript level and alot of Display PostScript and level How to get Pixar films The various John Lasseter Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited Film Individual Price Institutional

say At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for That was a sale price You can get it for slightly more than that normally maybe I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail at Pixar's address Pixar West Cutting Blvd Richmond, CA FAX You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains Luxo, Jr , Red's Dream , Tin Toy and Knicknack for , plus for shipping They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented How do I draw a circle as a Bezier or B spline curve The short answer is, You can't Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large If you want to do the job right, consult the article A Menagerie of Rational B Spline Circles by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume , number , September, , pages For rough, non rational approximations, consult the book Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I D Faux and M J Pratt, Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley For the best known non rational approximations, consult the article Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature continuous

hours or days later you get the file in the mail In addition, there is at least one FTP by mail server Send mail to saying help and it will tell you how to use it Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem see Eric Haines' article in Glassner's ray tracing book above for more information, including treatment of special cases Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon If the sum is pi, the point is inside, if the sum is the point is outside However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly Code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the
