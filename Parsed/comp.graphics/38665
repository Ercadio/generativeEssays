From Mark Newman Subject HELP advice on what video system to buy If this question is covered elsewhere I apologize but I need information My department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system on our network of IBM This is not an area in which I have any expertise so I wonder if anyone out there can offer We would like a system based either on VHS or video which will allow one write video frame by frame on tape for play back in real It's for visualization of physics Can anyone tell me what hardware is available which would work for our system Some support software is obviously needed too but nothing particularly sophisticated since the software we actually use for the visualization is all already Please email with replies as I don't read this Many thanks for your Department of Physics Cornell
