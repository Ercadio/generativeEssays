From Allan Weber Subject Need help with Mitsubishi image printer Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi video printer and I could use some help with We bought this thing because it has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and claimed to print gray level However the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print and bit pixel After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett Packard workstation and I can print and bit pixel images just I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal This was not mentioned in the sales However they did say the can do bit pixel level images in parallel mode but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call Japan Frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do bit pixel images from the video source it can't store bits pixel in the It's not like memory is that expensive any If anybody has any information on getting bit pixel or even bit pixel images out of this thing I would greatly appreciate your sending it to Allan Weber Signal Image Processing Institute University of Southern California
