from c dk povl h pedersen subject re products to handle hdtv moving pircture mb sec how does the 16 bit color of hdtv work ? it can not be 5 bit red green and
blue like on the macintosh. this gives only 64 gray levels. apple also has developed a point-point network that is around 200mb (not
sure if it is bits or bytes) per sec.
