From Kouhia Juhana Subject Re XV problems In article writes In article Kouhia Juhana writes I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary Think about what you are saying The bit image is quantised down to bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary You then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette I suppose you don't know what about we have We discussed about error s in XV which shows images only as and my suggestion above works perfectly with So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV that is there must be a colormap The problems you present are exist anyway and I didn't tried to solve them at all because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first Gamma and color corrections are easily done to image as I There's no need make tricks from quantized image back to bit How would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more Ok you're writing about situation that user want edit images as and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a My solution doesn't work because there's no colormap withing real image you see user see image going back to is About changing individual colors in quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the XV allows this feature but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type Moreover XV is not a paint program you can only make those global In full XV changing individual colors sounds like paint program If person have screen there's need for tricks to get the original image Because user don't see full image there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized To select indiavidual color there could be cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from Ok I don't have thought very much painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make Not to mention painting program in Yes What is was wrong with xv It saved quantized rasterized images as jpegs jpeg is not designed for Also human expect that will be saved as image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the So XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design I have heard XV were designed first for images files but it were not good idea to take full images without making major change to the original So even all screen images are the processed images and saved images could have been very easily instead of Before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn't solve the Americans the lift is just an example Well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read Juhana Kouhia
