From zhenghao yeh Subject Ellipse Again Hi Everyone Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week I guess my question was not so Now I'd like to describe it in detail The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the In other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse The answer is no Ironically DMIS an American Indutrial Standard says it is So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was The software was also sold Imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug How many qualified parts with ellipse were will be discarded And most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse are will be used I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on Now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things Please give me a I know you may argue this is not a CG You are right it is However so many people involved in the problem sphere from poits Why not an ellipse And why not its offset Please post here and let the others share our interests I got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers Yeh USC
