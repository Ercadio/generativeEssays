From DANIEL FALK Subject RE VESA on the Speedstar kjb MGL uvesa zip This is a universal VESA driver It supports most video boards chipsets include the Speedstar and X up to bit color Terry P S I've tried it on a Speedstar and X and it works Not with all software For instance it doesn't work at all with Animator Pro from Autodesk It can't detect ANY SVGA modes when running UniVESA This is really a problem as we need a VESA driver for both AA Pro and some hi color stuff Just out of curiosity Are you using the latest version Versions previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other information correctly I had problems with a lot of software until I got this version I don't think the author got around to posting an announcementof it or at least I missed it , but was available in the directory indicated as of I sure did use version It works fine with most software but NOT with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me Pretty useless program without that thing working IMHO So I hope the author can fix that Daniel Daniel Falk Don't quote me No comments Ebenezum the Great Wizard Also known as the mega famous musician Jkpg, Sweeeeeden Leinad of The Yellow Ones
