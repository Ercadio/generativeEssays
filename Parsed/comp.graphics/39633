From D J N D J Nettleton Subject HELP A rectangle and parallelogram I hope someone can help me with the following problem I'm sure there must be a known solution Given a rectangle defined by X x X and Y y Y where X and Y are constant and a parallelogram defined by C a x b y C and C c x d y C where C , C , a, b, c, d are constants and b a d c i e not parallel lines not equal to what is the area of their intersection What I'm after is some general algorithm suitable for ALL rectangles and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations At the moment it looks like I'm going to have to look at all possible cases and examine each seperately e g rectangle encloses parallelogram parallelogram encloses rectangle two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle Y Y origin Y Y X X two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle I hope someone can help Many thanks in advance, Dave Nettleton e mail D J N PS can you please cc me any replies by e mail
