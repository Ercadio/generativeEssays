From JER Subject scanned grey to color equations A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing f iltered grey scale images into one true color This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the equations Thanks for the help
