From Allen B Subject Re Fractals what good are they In article Ian D Romanick writes One thing a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge change in final There are certain things about the way the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that is while not entirely random This is also true with fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this Yeah and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals I just question whether you should The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number That has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but I don't think it has much to do with fractals and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable I guess I just haven't seen all these earth shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually I really hope I do but I'm not holding my self similar There is one other thing that fractals are good for fractal image Uh I'll believe it when I see I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years and I still don't believe in If it's so great how come we don't see it competing with JPEG 'Cause it can't I'll Actually I have wagered I quit trying to make fractal compression work and I was trying because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other It is neat I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but I don't see anyone using it in a real It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed right There are always going to be questions until there's a product out there Sloan The company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer he In March Iterated Systems will have the other half of the system the Scientific American March page Allen B Don't even get me started
