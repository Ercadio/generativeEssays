From Kate Kingman Subject Re LCD VGA display In article C BAB LL Ed Moore writes I've only had the computer for about months Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display My Toshiba T LCD CGA, died in months Replaced under the month warranty, fortunately When it died, it died instantly and completely I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several Toshiba 's in a short space of time They were all around years old Some screens went completely as above , others were just dodgy This happened to about or out of, maybe They were fairly reliable up to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's no link to the company So I would think that months may not be unreasonable just unlucky Regards, Kate Kate Kingman I leave the typos to The Tall BlondE occupy all the bored people out there
