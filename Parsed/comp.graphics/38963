From Chris Lilley Subject Re XV problems In article Kouhia Juhana writes In article writes moved on a bit I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary Think about what you are saying The bit image is quantised down to bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary You then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette Ok you could do this by copying the bit file to a bit file and using the extra bits to hold the index Having done this you need to do something to them what exactly Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group This could generate colours with RGB outside the range It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette However I suspect this would look rather So in summary what I said in my previous posting still holds How would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more If you want to do colour editing on a bit image you need much more powerfull software which is readily available In other words to edit a bit file you need software built for the Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it As to the other bits you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in If that was not what you meant then You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many places so Yes I probably I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point Sorry if I You also missed what is were wrong with However I did wrote Yes What is was wrong with xv Chris Lilley Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road Manchester Internet Voice Fax Janet
