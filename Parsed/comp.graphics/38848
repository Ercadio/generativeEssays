From Arthur Stein Subject Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international Computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research Similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data flow programming IBM Visualization Data Explorer software and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources including video recording Audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state of the art computer graphics into their research computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific The class size will be limited to participants on a first come first served Level Graduate advanced undergraduate or May be taken without credit as a Calculus linear algebra and introductory chemistry Familiarity with Unix X windows and C is useful but not Date June Credits June or credits Time Mon Fri am to pm and pm to pm Cost or credit credits Format The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility where computer workstations will be Daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final Those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems Content may vary Elements of computer graphics polygonal rendering lighting models ray tracing volumetric rendering stereo graphics animation introduction to data flow programming DX Representing the atom size time and energy scales basic classical and quantum mechanics Important categories of molecules small molecules biopolymers surfaces and catalysts miscellaneous current applications Data formats and conversions Advanced molecular graphics techniques Types of simulation and experiment electronic structure molecular dynamics mechanics electrostatics X ray crystallography NMR quantum dynamics and Instructors The course will be taught by two Topics related to computer graphics will be handled by Bruce Land Project Leader of Visualization Cornell National Supercomputing Chemistry specific aspects of the course will be handled by Richard Gillilan Visualization Specialist and Research Scientist Cornell National Supercomputing Facility TO REGISTER mail completed form to Cornell University School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions Day Hall Ithaca NY Questions Richard Gillilan IMPORTANT Acceptance will be first come first served and based on a target class size of full credit and single or non credit DEADLINE May Application Form Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems Chemistry Computer Science Social Security number if available Cornell ID number if available Name Last First Middle Suffix Jr etc Address Home Address where grades will be mailed Local Phone Home Phone Academic Discipline Course number check one Chemistry Computer Science Credits Status Undergraduate Student Smart Node Consultant Graduate Student Smart Node Advisor Post Doctoral Faculty Other explain Corporate Commercial Research Staff Other explain Name of Firm Indicate which of the following best describes you optional African American Alaskan Native Asian American Caucasian Hispanic American Native American List special needs mobility impaired Accommodations Blocks of rooms are available at the Reservations must be made no later than May Be sure to tell them you are here for the Cornell Theory Center Visualization Workshop Sheraton Inn One Sheraton Drive Ithaca FAX Rates starting at Other local motels Make your reservation early Our workshop coincides with other Cornell events Econo Lodge Cayuga Mall Triphammer Ithaca FAX Rates from ask for the Cornell Rate Dorm rooms have also been reserved participants both credit and non credit Participants who are interested in dorm rooms should call below for registration information Jeanne Miller or Donna Smith email or
