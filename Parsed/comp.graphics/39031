From Daniel E Bradley Subject Fractal terrain generator Does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac, something I could hopefully import into a D program like Swivel or Stratavision I know Infini D has built in capabilities, but I don't have access to Infini D I downloaded two programs from Umich, in graphics fractals, but both were from and crashed under System I think they were Black and white anyway Please, email me if you know of anything, as I don't check the newsgroups very often Thanks in advance Dan Bradley
