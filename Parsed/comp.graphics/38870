From Wayne Rigby Subject Re Cross Sobel Roberts Filters In article writes I saw an imaging program some time ago on an Amiga that had Cross Sobel and Roberts filters for edge Can anybody direct me to these OK never heard of Cross filters but Roberts Prewitt and Sobel filters are standard spatial masks for edge Highpass filtering does a good job of detecting edges A good reference for all sorts of general digital image processing is the book Digital Image Processing by Rafael Gonzalez and Richard Addison Wesley Publishing ISBN I've used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a grad Not too dificult to The worst part is loading in the images from TIFF GIF IFF ILBM whatever Wayne Rigby
