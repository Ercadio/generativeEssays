From Andre Beck Subject Re Fonts in POV In article qg fc , Coronado Emmanuel Abad writes I have seen several ray traced scenes from MTV or was it RayShade with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image The fonts chars had color, depth and even textures associated with them Now I was wondering, is it possible to do the same in POV Hi Noel, I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type fonts, triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic d object which could be used with PoV f i The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape Delaunay seems to be limited to convex hulls Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code example of how to do it Another way to do the bartman may be TGA POV A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields Create a b w picture BIG of the text you need, f i using a PostScript previewer Then, use this as a heightfield If it is white on black, the heightfield is exactly the images white parts it's still open on the backside To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original Example object union height field gif abp gif height field gif abp gif scale texture Glass translate center rotate rotate upwards scale scale bigger and thicker translate final placement abp gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ABP black on white in Times Roman points o o o Brain Inside o o o o Andre' Beck ABPSoft mehl Andre Beck IRS Inf TU Dresden de o o o
