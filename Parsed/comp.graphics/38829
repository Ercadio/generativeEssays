From Jihun Park Subject POVray tga rle Hello, I have some problem in converting tga file generated by POVray to rle file When I convert, I do not get any warning message But if I use xloadimage getx , something is wrong Error messages are, targatorle o o rle data tga xloadimage o rle o rle is a x bit RLE image with no map will dither to bits , with gamma of Dithering image done Building XImage done xloadimage X Error BadValue integer parameter out of range for operation on x xloadimage X Error BadWindow invalid Window parameter on xb I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend time to install them Even I do not want to generate rgb from POVray and then convert them to rle, if possible rgb to rle works, but it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs more steps to finally convert to rle file say cat rawtorle rleflip Does any body out there have same experience problems Thanks in advance, J Park
