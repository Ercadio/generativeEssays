From C Koltovoy Nikolay Alexeevich Subject NEWS Re List or image processing systems Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association Spectrum offer VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC AT wich include software and set of SOFTWARE For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was Kit includes more then different functions for image Kit works in the interactive regime and has include Help for non professional There are next possibility input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family read white image to from disk print image on the printer makes arithmetic with frames filter image work with gistogramme edit include users exe CONTROLLER The function of VS controller is to load TV images into PC VS controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV frame from a field of The clock rate is MHz when loading an image with pixel in the line and MHz when loading a pixels This provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal and vertical The number of gray levels in any input modes is Video signal capture time CONTROLLER The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM PC AT or any other machine of that The controller was created on the base of modern elements including user programmable gate The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different Its flexible architecture makes possible to change technical Instead of TV signal one can process any other analog signal including signals from slow speed scanning devices The controller has the following technical characteristics memory volume from K to Mb resolution when working with standard video signal from to pixels resolution when working in slow input regime up to pixels video signal capture time maximum size of a screen when memory volume is pixels number of gray level clock rate for input up to MHz input video multiplexer input output lookup table LUT possibility to realize scroll and zoom lines for external synchronization an input using external controlling signal electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog digital converter possibility output image to the color RGB One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the controller by reprogramming IMAGE PROCESSOR Image processor allows to digitize and process TV signal in real It is possible digitize TV signal with resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation with two Processor was created on the base of modern elements including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board for Memory volume allows write to the frames with It is possible to accumulate until The processor has the following technical characteristics memory volume to Mb number of the gray level input video multiplexer input output lookup table electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference image size from to possibility color and black white output possibility input from slow scan video
