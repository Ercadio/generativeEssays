From Jesse Lackey Subject Re Fast polygon routine needed In article Alan Christiansen writes I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersecting This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan Complex figure type polygons can be a bit It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave multi outline algorithm but not tremendously I spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about This is all C on HP PA RISC the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as I could tell For any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all Definitely the way to sorry but my code CANNOT be made public jesse Jesse Lackey Eye Ithaca NY
