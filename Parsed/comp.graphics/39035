From Subject Creating FLI FLC Animation Files I am looking for a means to add FLI and FLC animation creation to a Windows I was hoping for something along the lines of AAWIN or AAPLAY by Autodesk but for the creation of these delta compressed I have FLILIB but this seems to be coded for the Large memory model of DOS with Turbo Ideally I would like a DLL or Medium model object library but would settle for anything I've seen other Windows apps with FLI FLC creation did they hack the FLILIB code into submission Any pointers would be appreciated please send mail directly to me and I will summarize the results if there is Andrew Hudson
