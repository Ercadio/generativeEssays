From Dr John S Eickemeyer Subject Re Sphere from points In article qkgbuINN Edward Bolson writes Boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ center and radius, exactly fitting those points I know how to do it for a circle from points , but do not immediately see a straightforward way to do it in D I have checked some geometry books, Graphics Gems, and Farin, but am still at a loss Please have mercy on me and provide the solution Off the top of my head, I might try Given p , p , p , p Find p c center of sphere determined by p , , p , dist p c, p i radius p c is the same distance from our four points, so dist p c,p dist p c,p dist p c,p dist p c,p Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots distsq p c,p distsq p c,p distsq p c,p distsq p c,p Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the x c, y c, and z c terms cancel out, leaving you with three linearly independent equations and three unknowns x c, y c, z c Solve using your favorite method All the best, John Dr John S Eickemeyer The Lord God is subtle, Information Technology Institute but malicious He is not National Computer Board, Singapore Email Albert Einstein
