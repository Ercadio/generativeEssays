From Richard J McDougald Subject Re Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly In article B vmcbrt diablo UUCP diablo UUCP cboesel Charles Boesel writes Yeah, Corel Draw and WordPerfect Presentations pretty limited here, too Since there's no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program, this tracing technique is about it Simple stuff, like b w logos, etc do pretty well, while more complicated stuff goes haywire I suspect even though I don't write code that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares we're using but even so, how come one hasn't been written to my knowledge I mean, even Hijaak, one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion, hasn't attempted it yet Mac McDougald Any opinions expressed herein The Photography Center are not necessarily actually, Univ of Tenn Knoxville are almost CERTAINLY NOT those of The University of Tennessee Things are more like they are now FAX than they've ever been before
