From Karl Schultz Subject Re VESA standard VGA SVGA programming How VESA standard works Any documentation for VESA standard The VESA standard can be requested from VESA VESA North First Street, Suite San Jose, CA Ask for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards VESA also defines local bus and other standards The VESA standard only addresses ways in which an application can find out info and capabilities of a specific super VGA implementation and to control the video mode selection and video memory access You still have to set your own pixels At a higher resolution than x x or x x VGA mode, where the video memory A AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation I heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know nothing on how it is implemented Any advice, anyone VESA defines a window that is used to access video memory This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write, and then you can write as far as the window takes you usually K Windows have granularities, so you can't just anchor them anywhere Also, some implementations allow two windows My interest is in x x mode Should this mode be called SVGA mode What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the above mode How to deal with different SVGA cards This is VESA mode h There is a Set Display Start function that might be useful for scrolling Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions would be greatly appreciated Please send me mail Your best bet is to write VESA for the info There have also been announcements on this group of VESA software Karl Schultz These statements or opinions are not necessarily those of IBM
