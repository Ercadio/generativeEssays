From Dave Watson Subject Re Delaunay Triangulation zhenghao yeh writes Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is Is there any reference to it The Delaunay triangulation is the geometrical dual of the Voronoi tessellation and both constructions are derived from natural neighbor order Aurenhammer, F , , Voronoi Diagrams A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure ACM Computing Surveys, , p Okabe, A , Boots, B , and Sugihara, K , , Spatial tessellations concepts and applications of Voronoi diagrams Wiley Sons, New York, ISBN , p Watson, D F , , Computing the n dimensional Delaunay tessellation with application to Voronoi polytopes The Computer J , , p Watson, D F , , Natural neighbour sorting The Australian Computer J , , p Dave Watson Internet Department of Mathematics The University of Western Australia Tel Nedlands, WA Australia FAX
