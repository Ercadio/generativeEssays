From van Rijt Subject Re Sphere from points There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation The points x y z on a spherical surface with radius R and center a b c can be written as x a y b z c R This equation can be rewritten into the following form R a b c x y z Approximate the left hand part by F x y z For all datapoints determine the parameters which minimise the average error F x y z x y z In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these The best fitting sphere will have center a b c radius R sqrt So at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations I think Quick van Rijt
