From Kouhia Juhana Subject Re XV problems In article A C C L writes Yes XV is an bit program This is not a bug Never claimed it is a bug XV can import bit images and quantises them down to bits This is a handy facility, not a bug Never claimed it is a bug How would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated If you want to do colour editing on a bit image, you need much more powerfull software which is readily available commercially I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth Again, this is not a bug Never claimed it is a bug I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many places so far You also missed what is were wrong with XV However, I did wrote it Juhana Kouhia
