From steve hcrlgw Steven Collins Subject Sphere from points Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets of points and intersecting the normals from This would also define the circle However small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not Supposedly planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not Having thought about this why don't you project the lines onto the plane formed by the Do an intersection calculation in the plane in where you're guaranteed a unique solution unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of This bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in Hope I haven't put my foot in it again steve Steven Collins email Visiting Computer Graphics Researcher phone Hitachi Central Research fax
