From Dave Dennis Subject Re Adobe Type Manager what good is it Peter J Menchetti writes The subject says it I bought Adobe Type Manager and find it completely I ftped some atm fonts and couldn't install What's the use Are you supposed to be able to convert ATM fonts to Truetype If there's anyone out there who has this program and actually finds it useful enlighten me Pete There are some tricks to installing ATM to install them first to dos then run the ATM control panel to get them into The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the Truetype is a failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about keeping their formats Just about any service bureau or print shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document to them for high resolution printing or Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around they are really for dot matrix or your own lazer However you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program to ATM fonts for high end If you are using dot matrix for all your printing you may have wasted your money Dave
