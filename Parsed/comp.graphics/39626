From Dick Wilmot Subject Re Products to handle HDTV moving pircture MB sec writes Hi, I'd like to know if there is any system CPU HD array framebuffer which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime HDTV has about MB frame, so recording playing moving picture will need about MB sec bandwidth I'm thinking to treat the raw data not compressed Finding a disk array that can do MB sec will be difficult The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy IBM also sells these They can attach HiPPI at up to MB sec bit For these kinds of data rates you need more than SCSI for connections Their latest model, the RAID model Gen only does MB sec but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster They are also not idle must be working on newer products that might be faster and are a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces They still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago Maximum Strategy, Inc Buckeye Court Milpitas, CA You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times sustained throughput might come close to maximum burst rate Interesting problem Tell us more if you can If anyone can advise me what kind of product I should look into, please e mail me I will appriciate it The vendor's e mail address, price of the products, actual performance data of the products, any info will help me Thanks in advance, Kaz Sato, Tokyo, Japan e mail Dick Wilmot Editor, Independent RAID Report
