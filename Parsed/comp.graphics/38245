From Daniel Q Naiman Subject Geometry package I am looking for a package which takes as inputs a set of geometric objects defined by unions of convex polytopes specified in some manner say by inequalities and equalities and determines in some reasonable form things like intersections unions Does anyone know where I can find such a thing Dan Naiman Department of Mathematical Sciences Johns Hopkins University
