From Wayne Rigby Subject Re Need gif iff file format In article rkjm i q bigboote WPI EDU rtaraz bigwpi WPI EDU Ramin Taraz writes Could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff file formats are, or where I can get such info Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in or so It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system GIF is limited to bit color but has a built in compression scheme LZW IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe I could be wrong , for the Amiga It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM InterLeaved BitMap but many others exist This format supports bit color images Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof cs rice edu in the directory pub graphics formats Taken from the FAQ for this news group Wayne Rigby
