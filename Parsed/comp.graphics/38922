From Torgeir Veimo Subject virtual sound I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual What i want to do is the following From a fast source a CDROM several sound sources are read each having it's own defined position and other attributes direction Given the listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes Additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity Have someone done this and or written articles on implementing such a system Please post or mail any answers or Torgeir Veimo Studying at the University of Bergen 'm gona wave my freak flag high Jimi Hendrix it would be okay on any other day The Police
