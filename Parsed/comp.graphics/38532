from john j humpal subject re images of earth in article louis van dompselaar writes so they should sue the newspaper i got it from for printing it.
>the article didn't say anything about copyrights. the newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its
entirety. newspapers generally employ legal staffs which make sure
they get permission to use a copyrighted image or text. did you
do the same?
