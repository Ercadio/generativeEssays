From Toby Freeman TJF Subject Re CorelDraw Bitmap to SCODAL Does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert CorelDraw files containing bitmaps to SCODAL as this is the only format our bureau's filmrecorder Jeff Lyall I used this combination for a while A QCR Z recorder I think and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in SCODAL Just select 'EXPORT' on the main file This may not be implemented in earlier versions of course in which case you're on your own Also I seem to think that the s w for the QCR Z at the time did strange and very undesirable things if ANY part of the pic was outside the screen area on I once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow strayed off screen causing my whole slide to be blank The QCR Z also couldn't handle grad fill over grad fill so if you use a graduated colour background if you then grad fill an object on top of this the fill appears on the final slide as a circle I think and TOTALLY IGNORES the shape of the object being filled Of course if the recorder isn't a QCR you can ignore all this and feel suitably Cheers Toby Freeman Glasgow University
