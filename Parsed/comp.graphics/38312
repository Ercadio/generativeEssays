From Spencer Thomas Subject Re cylinder and ray Sketch Rotate so cylinder axis is Z Intersect X Y projection of line with projected cylinder similar to but easier than sphere intersection Result no intersection one intersection or two intersections parameterized along line by and Now look at Z and compute intersections of line with top and bottom planes of This gives ' and ' The interval of intersection is then the bit of the line from INTERSECT ' ' Details left as an exercise for the S Spencer Thomas Info Tech and Networking CFOB Genome Informatician Univ of Michigan Ann Arbor MI FAX
