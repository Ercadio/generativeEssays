From Edward Bolson Subject Re Sphere from points I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code which I will also The intersection of planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't I may be misinterpreting of I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations To get the planes I was taking the midpoint of the line from say to and setting the normal as the normalized vector from to These just plugged into the formula in Graphics HOwever the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all of my test points for different tests My matrix vector math is very rusty but it looks like I need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine I don't have but should be easy to find Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets of points and intersecting the normals from This would also define the circle However small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not Supposedly planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not Ed Thanks to all who answered so Ed Bolson University of Washington Cardiovascular Research preferred if you must
