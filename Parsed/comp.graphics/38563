From John Bickers Subject Re HELP GRASP Quoted from A by Jacques Oberto file, check in the 'graphics' directories under grasp The problem is that the clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of the many pd format converters I have used Any hint welcome The gl p lzh stuff under gfx show on the Aminet sites includes a utility called pic hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle the most commonly used kinds of PIC and CLP files The biggest problem is that the CLP files don't usually contain a palette, so you need to convert a PIC with the right palette first which creates a ram picpal file , and then convert the CLP files Jacques Oberto John Bickers, TAP Radioactivity It's in the air, for you and me Kraftwerk
