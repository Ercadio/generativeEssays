his postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues
of astronautics. plus, he is attentively following the erudite
discourse of the big brains who post to sci.space; is it not
inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from
reading the likes of you and me? [1] like others involved in sci.space, mr. adams shows symptoms of being a
fledgling member of the technoculture, and i think he's soaking it up
fast. i was a young guy with dreams once, and they led me to get a
technical education to follow them up. too bad i wound up in an
assembly-line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day...
