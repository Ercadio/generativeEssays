From Gary Coffman Subject Re What if the USSR had reached the Moon first In article Graydon SAUNDRSG writes In article Gary Coffman says It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose it's possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose but it's most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic Can you put a person base on the Moon for million a year Even if you use grad students You might be able to run one for that put it there Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will be significant commerical activity on the Moon Wishful thinking It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets aside from the semi mythic that might be useful in low grade fusion Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military weapons systems but it holds very minute commercial If space travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction as Everest and the Antarctic have become but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of Luna has an inconvienent gravity It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic Yet it's too high to do micro G Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials heatsink and The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements and volatile compounds and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta v is required to reach We don't use of the Earth now the seafloors and we virtually ignore Antarctica a whole That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a Luna is a much more expensive place to visit or to live and I think we'll use the easier places That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries if not much Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory shielded from the noisy Or as the site of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth or bombarding it as the case may The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental Little ultimate profit Gary Gary Coffman You make it gatech gary Destructive Testing Systems we break uunet rsiatl gary Shannon Way Guaranteed emory gary Lawrenceville GA
