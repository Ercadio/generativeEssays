From Dillon Pyron Subject Re What planets are habitable In article Henry Spencer writes In article Ken Hayashida writes As for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure is in my opinion to the scaling of Everest without oxygen This is quite a feat of physiological Indeed so it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly It is possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere beyond what is induced by the Earth's rotation thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere air cools at poles and descends flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises and this helps just enough to make Everest without oxygen Only just feasible mind you the guys who did it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation and probably incurred some permanent brain Climbers regard metres and up as The Death Zone Even on Oxygen you are slowly At Everest most climbers spend only a short period of time before I've been above Descending as little as feels like walking into a jungle the air is so Everest in winter without oxygen no support party Alpine style That is the ultimate challenge or is it solo Dillon Pyron The opinions expressed are those of the TI DSEG Lewisville VAX Support sender unless otherwise when I'm here when I'm home Texans Vote NO on Robin We need solutions not PADI DM
