Subject Re Gamma Ray Where are they From In article Pat writes What evidence indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away Given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by Why would they have to be at galactic ranges my own pet theory is that it's Flying saucers entering hyperspace but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer pat Well lets took a class on this last fall and I have no notes so I'll try to wing Here's how I understand Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars pulsars are formed from high mass stars M star sun High mass stars live fast and burn hard taking appoximately years before going nova or In this time they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any of these if assumed to be the sources of GRB's will be in the plane of the Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system Pioneer Venus has one either or GINGA and of course BATSE and we do distribution tests on our These tests all show that the bursts have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of homogeneity they do not clump in any one So unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these Now I suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the Well not Remember we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto pioneer so we should be able with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to Here's an analogy You see a plane You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which is the same as The two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a To my knowledge no one has been able to do I should throw in why halo and corona models don't work As I said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts short timescales high energy black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of If this is the case as I said before these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these When you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk but you sample out to large distances say mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic As I said before there is none of these I think that's all of someone needs clarification or knows something that I don't know by all means correct I had the honor of taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was and some VERY outrageous Colliding pulsars black holes pulsars that are slowing like It's a fun Complaints and corrections to or post jeremy
