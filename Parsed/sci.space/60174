From Subject Re DC X Vehicle Nears Flight Test In article Henry Spencer writes In article snap mrc Paul Johnson writes This bit interests How much automatic control is there Is it purely autonomous or is there some degree of ground control The stick and rudder man is always the onboard The computer normally gets its orders from a stored program but they can be overridden from the How is the transition from aerodynamic flight if thats what it is to hover accomplished This is the really new It's also one of the tricky There are four different ideas and DC X will probably end up trying all of This is from talking to Mitch Burnside Clapp who's one of the DC X test pilots at Making Pop a drogue chute from the nose light the engines once the thing stabilizes base Simple and Heavy shock loads on an area of structure that doesn't otherwise carry major Needs a door in the hot part of the structure a door whose operation is mission Switch off pitch stability the DC is aerodynamically unstable at subsonic speeds wait for it to flip and catch it at degrees then light A bit Light the engines and use thrust vectoring to push the tail Probably the preferred method in the long Tricky because of the fuel feed plumbing the fuel will start off in the tops of the tanks then slop down to the bottoms during the Keeping the engines properly fed will be Build up speed in a dive then pull up hard losing a lot of speed this thing's L D is not that great until it's headed up and the vertical velocity drops to zero at which point it starts to fall tail Light Also a bit scary and you probably don't have enough altitude left to try All work is one man's Henry Spencer U of Toronto Zoology Kipling utzoo henry Since the DC X is to take off horizontal why not land that way Why do the Martian Landing Or am I missing Don't know to much about DC X and overly obvious Why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts Parachute in Michael Adams I'm not high just jacked Please enlighten Ignorance is easy to make a mistake and everyone will let you know you messed
