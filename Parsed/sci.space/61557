From Pat Subject Re Space Manuevering Tug was HST servicing mission In article Josh Hopkins writes Pat writes I wrote Pat writes My data shows that the OMS engines hold kg of Of that a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry burn and the So Pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS and extra parts are going If you can make the numbers work out then I'll be After you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS and extra equipment is going to I don't Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is budgeted for the altitude change Henry any figures on the mass full for the EDO pallet plus it's dry weight How about for the dry mass of Bus it was being de classified as i checked Also I current orbital parameters of HST projected orbital parameters after re Discovery's DRY weight HST's Dry I somehow think they could train up a new EVA in First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was because they had They don't like to do that as a general So how long do they need to train a year years somehow I think moths should be Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more Also because they significantly lacked on orbit EVA The HST is designed for on orbit it should be a lot Third they don't have eight They have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it You may think I have a pessimistic I think it's I'm not saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA There comes a time in every project to kill the They can if neccessary re schedule the HST December is not a drop dead date unlike say the LDEF retrieval All they have to do is soup it up Just what does that mean I suspect the BUS may not have enough basic thrust for the HST re it mayu need bigger tanks or bigger My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not a My understanding is the mission needs both a new FOC and work on the electrical system plus another re If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's million No That's million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement costs minus extra operating Somehow i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then and the extra stuff is real NASA has lots of suits MMU's and the EDO pallets are re Oh one double magnum of champagne now there's a couple hundred Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's made to perform this task it also ignores the There is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done about Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door you haven't solved the That door has cycled X times Once after massive G I somehow think they can work ou reliability methods to ensure the door Also please tell me how some sort of sublimated material like or would manage to contaminate the mirror anything that goes to vapor state shouldn't adhere to the somehow the door problem can be maybe they can put a one time spring on what do they do now if the door hangs that door is part of a intrument safing if it hangs up tomorrow it'll be months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix pat
