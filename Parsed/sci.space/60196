From fred j mccall Subject Re nuclear waste In Paul Dietz writes In article fred j mccall writes This system would produce enough energy to drive the accelerator perhaps with some left A very high power 's of MW CW or quasi CW very sharp proton beam would be required but this appears achievable using a linear The biggest question mark would be the lead target chemistry and the on line processing of all the elements being Paul quite frankly I'll believe that this is really going to work on the typical trash one needs to process when I see them put a couple tons in one end and get relatively clean material out the other end plus be able to run it off its own residual Sounds almost like perpetual motion doesn't it Fred the honest thing to do would be to admit your criticism on scientific grounds was invalid rather than pretend you were actually talking about engineering Given you postings I can't say I am surprised Well pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve Now where did I put those sackcloth and ashes I was not and am not 'pretending' anything I am so pleased you are not surprised No it is nothing like perpetual Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion or even that it sounded like perpetual motion the phrase was sounds almost like perpetual motion which I at least consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to Perhaps I should beg your pardon for being too precise in my use of language The physics is well understood the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical Folks have talked about spallation reactors since the Pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research Accelerator design has been improving particularly with superconducting accelerating cavities which helps Los Alamos has expertise in high current accelerators LAMPF so I believe they know what they are talking I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull relatively clean material out the Once the costs technological risks are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the Sure it's possible and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable approach And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy Are we talking ounces pounds or tons grams kilograms or metric tons for you SI fans of material and are we talking days weeks months or years days weeks months or years for you SI fans hmmm still using a non decimated time scale I see The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being built is that there isn't any reason to do Natural uranium is still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks technically Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real Mary Shafer NASA Ames Dryden I don't speak for others and they don't speak for
