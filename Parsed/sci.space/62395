From Pat Subject Shuttle and Pennicillin Pennicillin if i have everything correct, was a highly valuable Myco toxin, discovered during WW It proved to have an amazing Bacterio cidal effect without human toxicity It's immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal Although initially enormously expensive to culture, within years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within years, was not much more expensive then aspirin Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval It promised amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease It consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement, However it works less then in times of administration and costs , per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost The drug thus costs , per useful case, and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin, but to centoxin pat
