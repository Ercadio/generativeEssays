From Paul Dietz Subject Re Gamma Ray Where are they In article Kevin Plaxco writes resolving power of the BATSE is an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counters one on each corner of the Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the Obviously Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be The CGRO is what meters long You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors also as a function of photon energy Each of the detectors does not have isotropic To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto the I believe they have now reduced the error to about Paul Dietz
