From Subject Space Station Redesign JSC Alternative I have MB worth uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal Mark Holderman works down the hall from me and can be reached for comment at or via e mail at Mark proposed this design which he calls Geode rough on the outside but a gem on the inside or the ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and As you can see from file it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank ET in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System SRMS and by the Reaction Control System RCS This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity CG of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the In the current SSF design docking forces are limited to pounds which seriously constrains the design of the docking The ET would have a hatch installed pre flight with little additional launch We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit contrary to some rumors which have circulated here but we've never had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to performance penalties control debris generation and eventual de orbit and impact footprint Once on orbit we would vent the residual The ET insulation SOFI either a erodes on orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen or b stays where it is and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space Option b has the advantage of providing further micrometeor The ET is incredibly strong remember it supports the whole stack during launch and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control while the RCS will be used for gyro The module also contains a de orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de orbit so we don't kill any more kangaroos like we did with Skylab The centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be used for long term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules opposite the ET and the solar This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical data and communication systems getting leverage from the SSF work done to Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City and he reports that he was warmly However the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design you should see his notes in the GIF Instead of posting a MB file to I tried to post these for anon FTP in but it was out of storage I'll let you all know when I get that Ken Jenks NASA JSC Space Shuttle Program Office of the space station is as inevitable as the rising of the Wernher von Braun
