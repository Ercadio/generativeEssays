From Phil Fraering Subject Re Over zealous shuttle critics Ken Hayashida writes Rockwell International in Downey California in conjunction with the other shuttle contractors delivered the world's most important and most revolutionary space Ha One cannot argue with the fact that it flies lands and is Watch It It It gets In my opinion these were the only appropriate specifications for this That's not what they told us back in the ' ' It has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the X program and the later X series lifting It isn't a logical follow A logical follow on would have been either a Russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies or something like MMI's Space Van or Boeing's TSTO or the airbreathing TSTO the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year The engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to develop a system which was man ratable could land reliably and could be These goals were quite visionary for the 's and I would argue that they are challenging even today including for the DC X Keep that attitude and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes along and kicks our ass in the space I do not recall a flight week specification in the final NASA specs for the space shuttle If you have such documents I would find them most revealing and As far as I can tell the only people touting a flight per week flight rate were people on Capitol Hill or selling books to the general Or NASA That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability if we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent which is by now probably a lot more than IMHO political statements in the halls of the US Congress are not admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by NASA DOD and contractors not by Congressmen Senators or Missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering Yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is questionable IMHO so it's a success never mind that you couldn't get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in a thousand The shuttle is the only reusable space This automatically qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering You could argue about its political But engineering wise it is clearly the most advanced machine ever I argue that engineering and technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of Shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of You can get hypersonic flight data with an X or a follow on X type vehicle for much And economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X Then Henry wrote HS Sorry support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers HS that I have some hope of riding some At the moment that's HS DC X's hoped for I was disappointed by this and other similar statements from those vocal in support of the DC X program Your support of DC X is based on My support for the shuttle program is based on The shuttle program has a bad I once had hopes for the shuttle By now I know those hopes were All I have for DC X and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles are But at least I know they aren't false hopes I did support the shuttle way back It didn't do nearly what it was supposed It's time to move on to something that might do the job of orbital delivery Or at I think that it is also important to note that I do not object to DC It is I originally posted I like the DC X and I am really hopeful that it'll be a stunning success Unfortunately DC X'ers are not willing to return that support the proven Shuttle Explain why you folks criticize shuttle when shuttle is exactly what you guys need in order to learn how to operate DC X on We don't want to learn how to operate on It launches it shoves out the payload it It doesn't waste payload hauling up and down EDO pallets and the The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how not to build a Finally that bit about the proven Are you hoping you can tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it I enjoyed your later postings regarding the comparisons between the shuttle and the Soyuz Although I may disagree with your method of You probably will disagree with I think that the total impact of the shuttle program must be judged on the scientific and technical merit not on timelines and schedules do you agree How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent on shuttle had been spent differently As for now we need to stop thinking of DC X and shuttle as mutually Learn about economics and the current budget realities in the United States Thanks for your Phil Fraering Number one good faith You convert you not tortured by demons Mahen missionary
