From Tom Van Flandern Subject Re temperature of the dark sky Henry Spencer writes Does anyone have a reference something I can look up, not just your own recollections I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the night sky as seen from space You'll find that in Allen, C W , Astrophysical Quantities , Athlone Press, Dover, NH, rd edition, pp To the accuracy it can be calculated see specific references in Allen about how it is calculated , the temperature is degrees K Lots of people have remarked on this temperature The first may have been in Eddington's book, Internal Constitution of Stars , Ch reprinted , where he gives the temperature of space as degrees The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially higher than that of the MBR, once you figure in things like stars and the zodiacal light, but I'd like numbers To the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature Some of us think this may not be a coincidence Tom Tom Van Flandern Washington, DC Meta Research was founded to foster research into ideas not otherwise supported because they conflict with mainstream theories in Astronomy
