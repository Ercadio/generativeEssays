From Subject ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe A very simple experiment can demonstrate PROVE the FACT of BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS reactions like Mg O Ca Si C Ca K H Ca CO as described in the BOOK Biological Transmutations by Louis Kervran Edition is and in Chapter of the book THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird Obtain a good sample of plant seeds all of the same Some kinds might work better that Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four Separately incinerate both Weigh the residue from each The residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral Some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen hydrogen carbon nitrogen BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY even in our own Ingesting a source of organic silicon silicon with carbon such as horsetail extract or radishes can SPEED HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si C Ca much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen The two reactions Si C Ca by micro organisms cause STONE SICKNESS in statues building bricks The reaction CO catalysed by very hot iron creates a CARBON MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators and people near woodstoves even properly sealed ones Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN IN SPITE OF the currently accepted laws of physics including the law which says that atomic fusion requires EXTREMELY HIGH temperatures and BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS And Their Applications In CHEMISTRY PHYSICS BIOLOGY ECOLOGY MEDICINE NUTRITION AGRIGULTURE GEOLOGY Edition by Louis Kervran Active Member of New York Academy of Science Pages Illustrated Swan House Publishing Box Binghamton NY THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird Pages Harper Row New York Chapters and are about RADIONICS Entire book is FASCINATING For more information answers to your questions please consult my CITED SOURCES the two books UN altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Information is Robert McElwaine Physics and Astronomy UW EC
