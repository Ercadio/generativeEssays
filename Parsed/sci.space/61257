From EDU AU raymond fairfield Subject Re Surviving Large Accelerations Lan Pham writes in answer to Amruth Laxman are you sure g is the right number as far as i know, pilots are blackout in dives that exceed g g g seems to be out of human tolerance would anybody clarify this please lan Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull out, not the dive, that figure is about right for sustained G, no protection The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are all critical parts of the equation I remember one note about instrumented gridiron players recording peaks about G Stapp, the aviation doctor, either by accident or design, took a short period G in a rocket sled decelleration, eye balls out against a standard 's harness It had to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from mph at that G A bang seat can get up to about G, and you'd better be sitting straight Find the book by Martin Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad it can get if the rate of onset is too high A reclining position and a good G suit can keep a pilot functioning at around G A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a fluid, and high pressure situations are not new Anyone have any figures Ray Fairfield
