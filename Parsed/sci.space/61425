From Subject Re Long Term Space Voyanges and Effect NEwsgroup In article Ken Hayashida writes The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of I mean compared to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about I It think the average joe is interested curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist Not one which he is ever going to participate All of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation I like the idea of the study but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use If you want a general public document you'll need a more general I believe that if any long term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld the spacecraft Only through the careful analyses of engineering chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long duration As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems engineering the microworld isn't the The problem is understanding the basic chemical biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them For example the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and Food synthesis is not very far So we have to orbit a Well that's obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using This is where the engineering comes But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers Like in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponics it turns out that you can't do The lettuce growth is stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as So now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar This means some basic applied scientific And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so We also need to find out how they interact That's where we are So I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long duration First you need to do the literature There is a lot of information out Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term This could be useful especially if we make it available on the Then we can look at methods of analyzing the Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space In essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet and any other source Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real The data base itself could be useful for future That's my response Ken what do you think Tim
