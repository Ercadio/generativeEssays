Subject Space FAQ Data Sources From Jon Leech Archive name space data Last modified Date ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES DATA INTRODUCTION A wide variety of images data catalogs information releases and other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the remainder support some form of file Many sites are listed as providing 'anonymous FTP' This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on the Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP directly but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via Send mail containing only the word HELP to or and the servers will send you instructions on how to make The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Don't even ask for images to be posted to the The data volume is huge and nobody wants to spend the time on VIEWING IMAGES The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly large and I won't attempt to cover common formats GIF To read PDS and VICAR and many other formats on Unix systems running X use XV available by anonymous FTP from

ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and provides uniform access to ground based and space based astronomy data from NASA data centers across the It currently has over data catalogs of radio infrared optical UV and X ray data which can be queried by position or any other parameter in the The ADS also provides tools to manipulate and plot
