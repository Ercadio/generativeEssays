Orbital Flight Handbook parts SP Lunar Flight Handbook parts SP Planetary Flight Handbook parts These might be found in university aeronautics libraries or ordered through the US Printing Office GPO although more information would probably be needed to order Minovitch The Determination and Characteristics of Ballistic Interplanetary Trajectories Under the Influence of Multiple Planetary Attractions Technical Report Jet Propulsion Laboratory Pasadena Oct The title says Starts of with the basics and works its way Very It has a companion article Minovitch Utilizing Large Planetary Perubations for the Design of Deep Space Solar Probe and Out of Ecliptic Trajectories Technical Report JPL Pasadena You need to read the first one first to realy understand this It does include a short summary if you can only find the Contact JPL for availability of these Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics Peter Hughes John Wiley and Celestial Mechanics a computational guide for the practitioner Lawrence Taff Wiley Interscience New York Starts with the basics body problem coordinates and works up to orbit determinations perturbations and differential Taff also briefly discusses stellar dynamics including a short discussion of n body COMPUTING PLANETARY POSITIONS More net references Van Flandern Pullinen Low Precision Formulae for Planetary Positions Astrophysical Supp Series Look in an astronomy or physics library for this also said to be available from Willmann Gives series to compute positions accurate to arc minute for a period or years from Pluto is included but stated to have an accuracy of only about arc Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac MICA produced by the US Naval Valid for years outside US Available for IBM order or Macintosh order From the NTIS sales desk I believe this is intended to replace the USNO's Interactive Computer Interactive Computer Ephemeris from the US Naval Observatory distributed on IBM PC floppy disks Willmann Bell Covers dates Planetary Programs and Tables from to Bretagnon Simon Willmann Floppy disks available Fundamentals of Celestial Mechanics ed Danby Willmann A good fundamental Includes BASIC programs a companion set of floppy disks is available Astronomical Formulae for Calculators Meeus Willmann Astronomical Algorithms Meeus Willmann If you actively use one of the editions of Astronomical Formulae for Calculators you will want to replace it with Astronomical Algorithms This new book is more oriented towards computers than calculators and contains formulae for planetary motion based on modern work by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Naval Observatory and the Bureau des The previous books were all based on formulae mostly developed in the last Algorithms available separately on Practical Astronomy with your

Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula based on studies of cratering caused by nuclear D S S c K W crater diameter in km g p f n S g g gravity correction factor for bodies other than g e t Earth where g m s and g is the surface e t gravity of the target This scaling is cited for lunar craters and may hold true for other S p p correction factor for target density p p a t t p g cm for alluvium at the Jangle U a crater site p g cm for average rock on the continental C crater collapse factor for craters km in diameter for larger craters on Earth K km kT TNT equivalent n empirically determined from the Jangle U nuclear test W pi d delta V projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent given diameter d velocity v and projectile density delta in CGS delta of around g cm is fairly good for an An RMS velocity of V km sec may be used for Earth crossing Under these assumptions the body which created the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona km diameter would have been about meters in More generally one can use after Gehrels Asteroid Number of objects Impact probability Impact energy diameter km impacts year ergs assuming simple scaling Note that ergs tons TNT equivalent or the energy released by the Hiroshima A References Gehrels Asteroids and Physics Today an excellent general overview of the subject for the layman Shoemaker Asteroid and comet bombardment of the Earth very long and fairly technical but a comprehensive examination of the subject Shoemaker Williams Helin Wolfe Earth crossing asteroids Orbital classes collision rates with Earth and In Asteroids Gehrels University of Arizona Press Cunningham Introduction to Asteroids The Next Frontier Richmond Willman Bell covers all aspects of asteroid studies and is an excellent introduction to the subject for people of all experience It also has a very extensive reference list covering essentially all of the reference material in the MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY Two easy to find sources of map projections are the Encyclopaedia Brittanica particularly the older volumes and a tutorial appearing in Graphics Gems Academic Press The latter was written with simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind spherical trig formulae also appear as do digitally plotted examples More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John Snyder's USGS publication Map Projections A Working Manual USGS Professional Paper This contains detailed descriptions of projections with history features projection formulas for both spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth and numerical test It's a neat book all pages This one's You might also want the companion volume by Snyder and Philip Voxland An Album of Map Projections USGS Professional Paper This contains less detail on about projections and Formulas are in the back example plots in the You can order these The cheap slow way is direct from USGS Earth Science Information Center US

software to read and write it see the SKY UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM The Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software systems not distributed because of older media capacity Included were an ephmeris a satellite track and speech synthesis The ephmeris sky is available within AT T and to sites possessing a Unix source code The program is regarded as Unix source Sky is Send proof of

database which specifies right ascension declination and parallax for the Convert parallax into distance using the formula in part of the FAQ convert RA and declination to coordinates on a unit sphere see some of the references on planetary positions and spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this and scale this by the Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright
