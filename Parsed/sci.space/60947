From Andrew Broderick Subject Re Solar Sail Data In article writes I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar Sails I was at an interesting seminar at work UK's Space Science on this subject specifically on a small scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the I'll typein the handout he gave out at the Here goes The Microlight Solar Sail Introduction The solar sail is a well established Harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited In principle such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting This is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical Several attitude control methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cells providing watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail Launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of The craft would be capable of some ambitious For example a It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit b It could be steered into a lunar polar Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base BTW c It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet Impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp edged tube like performing a Returning to Earth the sail acts as an ideal re entry parachute load per unit area gm ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed deg The material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating Contact Colin Jack Oxford Mathematical Designs High Street Oxford England This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seeking details or anything and would be most happy to send you more Andy Andy Jonathan Broderick I have come that they might have Rutherford UK life and have it to the full Mail Jesus Christ
