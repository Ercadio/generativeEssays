from subject re why not give billion to first year long moon residents gene wright wrote announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation : who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. : then you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin : to be developed. there'd be a different kind of space race then! i'm an advocate of this idea for funding space station work, and i
throw around the $1 billion figure for that "reward." i suggest that
you increase the lunar reward to about $3 billion. this would encourage private industry to invest in space, which should be one of nasa's primary goals. -- ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office (713) 483-4368 "better. faster. cheaper." -- daniel s. goldin, nasa administrator
