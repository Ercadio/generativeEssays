from ethan bradford subject re gamma ray bursters where are they walker andrew john writes also,if they did come from the oort cloud we would expect to see the same from other stars oort clouds. that's a very good point. perhaps none of the nearby stars have oort
clouds? alpha-centauri is a multiple-star system; you wouldn't expect
an oort cloud in it. what's the nearest single-star that is likely to
have a planetary system?
