From Doug Page Subject Re Quaint US Archaisms In article C wC B M , nickh CS CMU EDU Nick Haines writes In article A Gary Coffman writes stuff deleted Of course the units of force have the same names as those of weight, but in order to use them you need to keep useful constants like the omnipresent ft sec around Maybe you'd like to go over again how this system is so natural and so easy to use, Gary While you're at it, you can figure out for us the weight of barrels and a quart of foo density lb oz per cubic foot on the moon gravity ft in sec Let's face it, even the imperial system uses a basically metric way of relating quantities i e that would be written as ft sec the only thing you're hanging on to is the right to express the same quantity as inches, feet, yards or chains What everyone else is saying is why do you want to do that Any apparent remaining complexity in the SI system is due to the multiplicity of the aforesaid prefixes In fact what's going on and the fundamental difference between SI and imperial is that you have exactly one unit of each type, and all values of that type are expressed as some multiple of the unit You mean like seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years Remember, the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale Some revisionists tell the history something like this The coldest point in a particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body temperature of a volunteer turns out he was sick, but you can't win 'em all Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into hundredths FWIW, Doug Page The opinions are mine maybe , and do not necessarily represent those of my employer or any other sane person, fot that matter
