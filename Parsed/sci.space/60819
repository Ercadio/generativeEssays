From Karl Anderson Subject Re A WRENCH in the works From another space forum NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a foot altitude then down to splashdown and towing back to NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media It's been a long time since something like this We've lost washers and bolts before but never a tool like The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April Unfortunately the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April launch The free flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster its inch long rope was still The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch Ron's note naaahhh just too easy A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for Karl Anderson DEV Configuration Management Version Control Dept Rochester Minnesota Tie INTERNET PRODIGY To seek to strive to find and not to Alfred Lord Tennyson
