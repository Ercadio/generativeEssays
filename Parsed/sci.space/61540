From David Ward Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for Days In article Pat In article Henry Spencer writes No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a Indeed this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed to the array flapping Why not design the solar arrays to be if the shuttle is going to retunr the HST what bother are some just fit them with a quick I didn't think the bi stem design was used so much for the retrieval as for the ability to launch in a tight size STS This is my own guess based on similar designs flown on other large STS launched s c GRO UARS Also there might be some consideration given to mass requirements bi stems weight less than conventional S A Finally the HST arrays do have the ability to be detached remember they're going to be replaced with new However as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bi stems whenever No half hertz flexible modes no thermal snap no David GSFC
