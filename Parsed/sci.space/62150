From Allen Sherzer Subject Re Shuttle Defects Bizarre DC X In article Ken Hayashida writes Well can I say You've attacked my beloved vehicle If I may offer a constructive criticism perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put I myself think the F is a beautiful aircraft but rest assured I wouldn't even think of flying it in combat Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they We see zero defects operation in many area s of Not to this Calling shuttle flight characteristics bizarre in the same post as touting DC X is Why DC X will also have similar zero defects issues am I wrong Your The DC approach is very tollerent of It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature Shuttle isn't reusable it's salvagable I am thinking of how DC X will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at supersonic The flip over happens at a very low speed not If the DC X shows the flip over works it will work unless the laws of physics How much in DC X is redundant That's the real The final DC will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight Upon re entry for example it can loose about of available thrust and still land Everything we do in life has zero defects issues at times agree Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design SSTO As a doctor I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way You wouldn't for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you While DC X's R D program makes good sense I am less optimistic about DC X as you and apparently others You are very much in the If the DC series fails to make orbit it will still be a very worthwhile It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build But DC X will still have It is the nature of aerospace R Again refering to the DC it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight Shuttle doesn' DC is fault tollerent Shuttle isn' It's successors are not slated to be passenger Not Build a passenger pallet a fairly easy thing to do and it will carry The impression I had when I visited MacDac Huntington Beach's Open House was that the payload space was limited and the man ratable version was decades I would suggest you talk to the DC X crew Their original schedule had an operational DC flying in Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences and medical related As for now it is our only ticket into space and has my Your ignoring the dammage it Mannes space has a reputation for being unreliable and hugely Shuttle supporters only make it easy for opponents of manned space to kill You could change my view on DC X if you could prove the following The only way to prove those things is to build Allen Lady Astor Sir if you were my husband I would poison your coffee Churchill Madam if you were my wife I would drink DAYS TO FIRST FLIGHT OF DCX
