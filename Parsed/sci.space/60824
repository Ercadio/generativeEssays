From goltz James Goltz Subject Orion drive in vacuum how Background The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the Now in an atmosphere I can see The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher But in a vacuum only two things I can see are going to hit the plate fission fusion products barium krypton helium neutrons evaporated bomb casing and electromagnetic radiation gammas mostly some light heat from irradiated fission products Would this work I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum especially given the mass of the pusher plate and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're I must be missing Would someone enlighten me via email Jim Jim Goltz AlterNet Engineer
