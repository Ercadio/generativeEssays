From Lee Hawkins Subject Re Space Marketing would be because of his doubtfull credibility as an Modern ground based visible light astronomy what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The Ahh perhaps that's why we've astronomers have just built meter ground based scopes and are studying designs for larger Seriously though you're never going to get a meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit Also scopes in low orbit like Hubble can only observe things continuously for minutes at a time which can be a serious opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or space based In any case a bright point of light passing through the field doesn't ruin If that were the case the I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent and as bright as the Have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned they are extremely Existing satellites are points of light but an advertising sign that appeared as a point would be useless so I rather think these will appear larger than a 'typical' Also satellite tracks are ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Frank Crary CU Boulder What deparment are you in anyway Philosophy You obviously are not qualified to speak about Lee Lee Hawkins Department of Astronomy Whitin Observatory Wellesley College Wellesley MA FAX
