From Jonathan McDowell Subject Re Shuttle Launch Question From article by Tom A Baker In article ETRAT Pack Rat Clear caution warning Verify no unexpected I am wondering what an expected error might Sorry if this is a really dumb question but Parity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were Yes that is an error but we already knew about it I'd be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote tom My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically known bugs in the warning system software things are checked that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't set till after launch and Rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew 'ok if you see a warning before liftoff ignore it' Jonathan
