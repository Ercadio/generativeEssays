organizations which will for a fee send you pretty certificates and star maps describing where to find your These organizations have absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they assign are not used by anyone It's also likely that you won't be able to see your star without binoculars or a See the back pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact

the thrust power gain G t much greater than Gain values of conventional solar fission electric propulsion systems are always quite small G t With these high thrust interplanetary flight is not possible because system acceleration a t capabilities are always less than the local gravitational In contrast gain values times higher are found for some fusion concepts which offer high thrust

The QED Engine System Direct Electric Fusion Powered Systems for Aerospace Flight Propulsion by Robert Bussard available from Energy Matter Conversion Center Street Manassas VA This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version of the Farnsworth Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion technology to Isp Farnsworth Hirsch demonstrated a neutron flux with their device back in but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising stability of the Soviet Hirsch responsible for the panic has recently recanted and is back working on Jim Bowery PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications by Paul Koloc Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY March Aneutronic energy fusion with little or negligible neutron flux requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at The PLASMAKtm innovation will make this possible its unique pressure efficient structure exceptional stability fluid mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi gigawatt electric output Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest I strongly recommend that people take this guy Bob Hirsch the primary proponent of the Tokamak has recently declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor the spheromak to be one of promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Aside from the preceeding
