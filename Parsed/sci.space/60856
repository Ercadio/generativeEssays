From wingo Subject Re NASA Wraps In article Allen Sherzer In article wingo writes BTW universities do the same They however have a wrap of to again this is over and above any overhead charge Wrong The max overhead charge is ALL of the There is no seperately budgeted overhead in any shape size form or A professor at the University of Virginia told me their wrap was about The subcontracts I have let out and worked on for other universities are about the My employer a non profit research institute does the This is generally reffered to as the I don't care who told you this it is not generally I see EVERY single line item on a contract and I have to sign There is no such thing as wrap at this I also asked around Ther is no wrap at Marquette University of Wisconsin Madison Utah State Weber State or Embry Riddle I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate How do I know I write proposals and have won contracts and I know to the dime what the charges At UAH for example the overhead is Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead Go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the If you have some numbers Allen then show them else quit I did Dennis read the To repeat an internal estimate done by the Reston costing department says Freedom can be built for about a year and operated for per year IF all the money where spent on Since we spend about half a billion more per year it looks like roughly of the money is Now if you think I'm making this up you can confirm it in the anonymous editorial published a few weeks ago in Space No Allen you did You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers where the work is going Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is This Dennis is why NASA has so many problems you can't accept that anything is wrong unless you can blame it on Oh sure you'll say NASA has problems but do you believe it Remember the WP overrun You insisted it was all congresses fault when NASA management knew about the overrun for almost a year yet refused to Do you still blame Congress for the overrun Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being selective with the facts By your own numbers Allen at a cost of million per flight the service cost of flying shuttle to SSF is billion for four flights so how did you get your one billion number I have no idea what your trying to say here Allen If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a You stated that your friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to Dennis University of Alabama in Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do Allen's math for him for a I will have little chance to do
