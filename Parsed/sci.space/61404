From julie moses Subject Re temperature of the dark sky Does anyone have a reference something I can look up not just your own recollections I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the night sky as seen from space Note I am not talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background There are more things in the sky than just the MBR what I'm after is total blackbody temperature what a thermal radiator would see disregarding or shielding against the Sun and nearby large warm I'm not sure if this will help you but the local interstellar radiation field has been measured and modeled by various If I remember things correctly the models involved contributions from three different BB sources so there's no obvious temperature of background radiation in our local However the following references give the interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength and you can integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an effective temperature if you like Witt and Johnson Henry et Mathis et As you can see the references are out of date but they might get you Hope this helps Julie
