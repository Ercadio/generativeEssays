From SCOTT I CHASE Subject Re Vandalizing the In article Keith Mancus That's Five Weeks In A Balloon And if anyone can tell me where to get it I sure would like a reply I've been looking for that book for TEN YEAR and never found Note that I am not looking for a collector's item I'm hoping that someone has published it in modern times either in paperback or I'm willing to spend or so to get a I too am a Jules Verne collector and can tell you that though tough to find it is out I keep my eyes open all the time for his books at various Bay Area used book stores and every once in a while get very You just need I don't know if the book store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area but good I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes to SF every other year though the prices are more in the range than the you want to My guess is that if you find it you won't need to spend even that much since most people don't care about I think I paid about for my dust jacket less but otherwise good condition copy which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate Of course if you re willing to buy blind you can put a advertisement in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter the exact title of which escapes me at the Five Weeks in a Balloon is not the rarest of Jules Verne Someone has it for sale somewhere and the AB is the way to find In fact I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers of Of course that takes the fun out of hunting for it Good Scott New under construction Scott Chase Please be patient SICHASE Thank you
