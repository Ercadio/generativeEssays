From Amruth Laxman Subject Surviving Large Accelerations Hi I was reading through The Spaceflight Handbook and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published in have already withstood accelerations of All this is very long winded but here's my question finally Are accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of If these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration Can this be extended to larger accelerations Thanks is Amruth Laxman
