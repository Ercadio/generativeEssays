From David Palmer Subject Re Gamma Ray positional Henry Spencer writes In article writes Actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me were talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like pounds of Well a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it and alone weighs about pounds Actually the situation is even worse than The total mass of the Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only pounds and most of that is support equipment like power and The mass available for instruments is maybe of I don't think a BATSE will From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet the instrument payload constraints are Mass allocation kilograms lbs Power allocation watts Required instruments Visible imaging system CCD mm fl f optics IR mapping spectrometer HgCdTe array energy resolution UV spectrometer nm nm resolution Radio science ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system ultrastable means This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated to the mission of the In addition the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator and the whole space craft will be about feet in diameter with no booms which means there will be strong gamma lines from Pu and associated schmutz in the background which tends to reduce sensitivity It would still be nice and our group here at Goddard is looking in to David Palmer
