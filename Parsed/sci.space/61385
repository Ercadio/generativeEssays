From wingo Subject Re HyperKnowledge In article tuparev EMBL Georg Tuparev ANNOUNCEMENT The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP Motivation We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages too often claiming to do everything What we need is an object oriented scientific environment where the tools we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system highly interactive and extendable both by the addition of our own specialized objects and by combining the available tools graphically The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work requiring a very short learning phase and practically no user I know this is kinda off the subject of but not really I want to answer this for their as well as everyone else's What these people are proposing by and large already exists and can be purchased It is called labview by National IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis Why re invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist It is a great idea but look out there at what is available The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this All SSME control and simulation studies along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with There are tons of applications with the ability to create virtual instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker With the addition of IEEE support the computer becomes a virtual control station allowing the graphic representation of remote With serial I O support that instrument can be The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT will utilize this Dennis University of Alabama in Huntsville
