Subject Re Gamma Ray positional From In article Kevin Plaxco writes In article David Ward writes Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location rotational of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all sky map's PR material for the other three instruments give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if that's any But I believe that there is a fundamental difference The other x three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the BATSE is an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counters one on each corner of the Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft Since none of the BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to determine Indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about parsec all together now Parallax ARc SECond a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a AU base line If the degree accuracy reported above is true we're going to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming Kevin Batse alone isn't always used to determine WHen a particularly bright burst occurs There are a couple of other detectors that catch it going Pioneer or is the one I'm getting at This puppy is far enough away that if a bright burst happens nearby the huge annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given by BATSE and we can get a moderately accurate Say oh or That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with Actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me were talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like pounds of Well a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it and alone weighs about pounds We decided against jeremy
