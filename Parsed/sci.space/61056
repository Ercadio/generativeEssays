From Rouben Rostamian Subject Re Sunrise sunset times In article Joseph Wetstein writes I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used to compute sunrise and sunset Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length of the You should be able to convert the information here to sunrise and sunset Rouben Rostamian Telephone Department of Mathematics and Statistics e mail University of Maryland Baltimore County bitnet Baltimore MD USA internet Definitions z the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its orbital In case of the Earth z is about degrees I I do not recall the exact In case of Uranus z is almost u latitude of the location where the length of the day is Paris is at about North pole is at a angular position of the planet around the As a goes from to degrees the planet makes a full circle around the The spring equinox occurs at a L daylight fraction duration of daylight duration of a full day On the equator u L is always Near the north pole u degrees L is sometimes one and sometimes zero depending on the time of the Computation Define the auxiliary angles p and q by sin p sin a sin z cos q h tan u tan p q degrees Conclusion L q if q is measured in degrees L q pi if q is measured in radians Wait But what is h The cutoff function h is defined as follows h s s if s if s if s As an interesting exercise plot L versus The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic Rouben Rostamian Telephone Department of Mathematics and Statistics e mail University of Maryland Baltimore County bitnet Baltimore MD USA internet
