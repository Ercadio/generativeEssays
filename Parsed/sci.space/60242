From Richard Buenneke Subject DC X Rollout Report McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC X HUNTINGTON BEACH On a picture perfect Southern California day McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC X rocket ship last The company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit SSTO rocket The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this Flight tests will start in mid Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for SSTO research remains The SDI Organization which paid million for the DC X can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow on To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital DC XA SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and However recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a Today the agency is more interested in using DC X as a step towards a low cost reusable sounding SDIO has already done briefings to other government agencies said Simon Pete Worden SDIO's deputy for But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective agency officials hail the DC X as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology Worden said the DC X illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within He said the program which went from concept to hardware in around months showed how today's engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents' The key is management Worden SDIO had a very light hand on this We had only one overworked major Jess Although the next phase may involve more agencies Worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science Space and Technology This is the direction we're going to have to go said George Brown the committee's Democratic Programs that stretch aout to years aren't hasn't learned it SDIO Dana Rohrbacher Brown's Republican colleague went Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space Rohrbacher whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas also criticized NASA Air Force work on conventional multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on Let's build a spaceship Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO McDonnell Douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its C transport and Space Station Freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro On very large ventures companies put in seed money said Charles Ordahl McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space You need strong government While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC XA they agree on continuing an incremental approach to Citing corporate history they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper DC Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and The first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take off and The second series will send the unmanned DC X up to The third and final series will take the craft up to Maneuvers will become more complex on third The final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged The flight test series will be supervised by Charles Pete Conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo moon Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to Features include automated check out and access panels for easy If the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt Whitney engines used on the DC Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to pounds of thrust Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages the A model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid Worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher The mechanism for the teaming may already be in Pratt has a technology agreement with NPO
