From Al Globus Subject Space Colony Size Preferences Summary Some time ago I sent the following message Every once in a while I design an orbital space I'm gearing up to do another I'd some info from If you were to move onto a space colony to live permanently how big would the colony have to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable Specifically How many people do you want to share the colony with What physical dimensions does the living are need to have Assume living the colony will rotate Assume that you can leave from time to time for vacations and business If you're young enough assume that you'll raise your children I didn't get a lot of responses and they were all over the Thanx muchly to all those who responded it is good food for Here's the edited responses I got How many people do you want to share the colony with What physical dimensions does the living are need to have Cylinder diameter x km long Rui Sousa How many people do you want to share the colony with What physical dimensions does the living are need to have square kms surface divided into city towns villages and Must have lakes rivers amd How many people really isn't that large a number everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year and will probably be sick of everyone else within another What physical dimensions does the living are need to have I am not all that great at figuring it But I would maximize the percentage of colony space that is accessible to Esecially if there were to be children since they will figure out how to go everywhere And everyone especially me likes to go exploring would want to be able to go for a walk and see something different each For population I think I would want a substantial town big enough to have strangers in This helps get away from the small town everybody knows everything syndrome which some people like but I don' Call it several thousand For physical dimensions a somewhat similar criterion big enough to contain surprises at least until you spent considerable time getting to know As a more specific rule of thumb big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on Call that which means a circumference if we're talking a Henry Spencer at U of Toronto Zoology utzoo henry My desires for permanent move to a space colony assuming easy communication and travel Size About a small town size say 'Course bigger is better Population about sq km or So for Less is better for elbow room more for interest and sanity so say max min Tommy Mac Tom McWilliams work Inhale to the Chief hm Zonker Harris in
