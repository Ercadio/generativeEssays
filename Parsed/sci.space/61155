From Subject What counntries do space surveillance Ethnocentric USian that I am I've assumed that we and the xUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track non cooperative objects in low Earth Grazing in a couple of databases recently I found that Japan has some optical capabilities along this line and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects Abstracts of the articles are This leads to the more general question do yet other people than the US Russia and Japan do space surveillance and if so how and why Allen Thomson SAIC McLean VA USA ABSTRACTS Optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite EGS TAKABE MASAO ITABE TOSHIKAZU ARUGA TADASHI Radio Research Laboratory Review ISSN March In Japanese with abstract in This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS experimental geodetic satellite which was launched on August by The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory RRL optical ground station are A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also The accuracy of EGS tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also In addition it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the Japanese amateur satellite JAS which was launched with the EGS was accurately determined by means of a satellite tracking It is clear from this experiment that optical observation data satellite direction data are very useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch Furthermore the results confirm the effectivenes of these two satellite optical tracking MU radar

Baltimore MD RPN AIAA PAPER Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high power VHF Doppler radar MU radar of An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning Although the results are preliminary they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar observations using a much higher It is found that the collision frequency of a Space Station of km x km size at an altitude of km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora EXOS C SATO INOOKA FUKAO Kyoto Japan KATO Kyoto Uji Japan Radio Atmospheric Science In International Council of Scientific Unions Middle Atmosphere Handbook for MAP p Publication Date As the first attempt among MST mesosphere stratosphere troposphere type radars the MU middle and upper atmosphere radar features an active phased array Unlike the conventional large VHF radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements each of solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal division combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer The antenna beam can be switched within microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA EXOS C A receiver named MUM MU radar antenna Monitor on board the satellite measures a CW signal of to watts transmitted from the MU The principle of the measurement and results are Equatorial radar system FUKAO SHOICHIRO TSUDA TOSHITAKA SATO TORU KATO SUSUMU Kyoto

sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to km altitude is now being designed in The radar will be built in Pontianak West Kalimantan Indonesia deg N

product of about x to the W sq m P average transmitter power A effective antenna aperture with a sensitivity of approximately times that of the MU This system configuration enables pulse to pulse beam
