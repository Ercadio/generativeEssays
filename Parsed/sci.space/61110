From Subject Re Death and Taxes was Why not give billion In article writes In my first posting on this subject I threw out an idea of how to fund such a contest without delving to deep into the I mentioned granting mineral rights to the winner my actual wording was mining Somebody pointed out quite correctly that such rights are not anybody's to grant although I imagine it would be a fait accompli situation for the So how about this Give the winning group I can't see one company or corp doing it a or year moratorium on Tom Freebairn Who says there is no mineral rights to be given Who says The UN or the US Government Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars who will stop you The UN can't other than legal tom Can the truly inforce it If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will stop you from doing Maybe not acknowledge you Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is Maybe I am a few years ahead on It is liek the old Catholic Church stating which was Portugals and what was Spains and along came the Reformation and made it all null and What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged and offer your services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids mars moon or what As long as yur sponsor does not get in Basically find a country who wants to go into space but can't for soem reason or another but who will give you a home Such as Saudia Arabia or There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN got to them and offer your services and I know that sound crazy is Also once you have the means to mine the moon or whatever then just do The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else they will not If your worried about the US do the same Why be limited by the short sighted people of After all they have many other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a little bit farther out to do jus ta little bit more and to tell the crown to piss If my ancestors thought the way many today think Id have been born in Central Europe just north of the Black I just read a good book Tower of the Gods Michael Adams I'm not high just jacked
