Subject Space FAQ Introduction From Jon Leech Archive name space intro Last modified Date FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON INTRODUCTION This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups and in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting send email to Jon Leech If you don't want to see the FAQ add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject you're out of luck The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ faq Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given The point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old Better to build on top than start Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the References are provided because they give more complete information than any short Questions fall into three basic types Where do I find some information about space Try your local public library The net is not a good place to ask for general Ask INDIVIDUALS by email if you There are other sources use them The net is a place for open ended I have an idea which would improve space flight Hope you aren't surprised but out of have usually been thought of Again contact a direct individual source for NASA fields thousands of these each Miscellanous These are addressed on a case by case basis in the following series of FAQ SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE Read if you're on Minimize cross references Do you REALLY NEED to Edit Subject lines especially if you're taking a Send mail instead avoid posting follow mail message worth posts Internet mail readers send requests to add drop to SPACE REQUEST not Read all available articles before posting a follow Check all Cut down attributed articles leave only the points you're responding to remove signatures and headers Summarize Put a return address in the body signature of your message mail or article state your institution Don't assume the 'reply' function of mailers will Use absolute Post in a timely Don't post what everyone will get on TV Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping keep lines under characters for those using ASCII terminals use carriage returns INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS I've attempted to break the postings up into related There isn't a keyword index yet the following lists the major subject areas in each Only those containing astronomy related material are posted to indicated by ' ' following the posting number

which inspired and was largely absorbed into this Peter Yee and Ron Baalke have and continue to spend a lot of their own time setting up the SPACE archives at NASA Ames and forwarding official NASA Many other people have contributed material to this list in the form of old postings to and which I've Please let me know if corrections need to be Contributors I've managed to keep track of are
