From Herman Rubin Subject Government and Science and Technolgy Investment In article writes People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and Basically the Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long Historically this role for the Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other In order for industries to compete with government subsidized foreign competitors the Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big ticket or long lead R This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science some of it is relevant in There was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of state universities of state funds for scientific research before The US research position had been growing steadily and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation There were not that many research universities but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for travel to scientific Not that much but it was provided and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as During WWII the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' This is probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution This works in stages and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems the job got The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future and started funding pure research after But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as NSF to do the It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics Also the government did a job on private foundations making it more difficult for them to act to support The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government Suppose as has been the case I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few What do you think happens if I ask for one The answer I will get is Get the money from Now the money at the university level is a few thousand but at the NSF level it comes to about thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting So the government is in effect deciding which projects get supported and how Also the government decided that the wealth should be So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into And instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating reseach As a researcher I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted I may find impossible or I may find that it is too In addition tomorrow I may get unexpected research Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can This is the nature of the beast and except for really vague statements if something can be predicted it is not major research but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to Herman Rubin of Statistics Purdue West Lafayette Phone Internet bitnet purdue pur ee hrubin UUCP
