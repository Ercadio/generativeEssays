From Ron Baalke Subject Galileo Update Forwarded from Neal Ausman Galileo Mission Director GALILEO MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT POST LAUNCH April SPACECRAFT On April real time commands were sent as planned to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna LGA swing Dual Drive Actuator DDA hammer On April the EJ Earth Jupiter sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April to June and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna RRA slew test on April The command loss timer was set to days as a part of this sequence memory On April and a NO OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours its planned value during this mission On April cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer MAG Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received On April an Ultra Stable Oscillator USO test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data long term trend analysis is On April a modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal to Noise Ratio SNR when transmitting at Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre launch selected modulation index is near the optimal On April cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV and Magnetometer MAG Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received On April a periodic RPM Retro Propulsion Module Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed all thrusters were flushed during the Thruster performance throughout the activity was The AC DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes greater than DN throughout this The AC measurement reads DN volts The DC measurement reads DN volts These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC DC special anomaly The Spacecraft status as of April is as follows a System Power Margin watts b Spin Configuration Dual Spin c Spin Rate Sensor Star Scanner d Spacecraft Attitude is approximately degrees off sun lagging and degrees off earth leading e Downlink telemetry rate antenna coded LGA f General Thermal Control all temperatures within acceptable range g RPM Tank Pressures all within acceptable range h Orbiter Science Instruments powered on are the PWS EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS i Probe RRH powered off temperatures within acceptable range j CMD Loss Timer Setting hours Time To Initiation hours GDS Ground Data Systems Galileo participated in a second DSN Deep Space Network acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase Upgrade on April using CTA Compatibility Test Area The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller TGC and the Telemetry Channel Assembly TCA The TGC TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly TPA Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test all ran well on both the MTS MCCC Telemetry Subsystem and the AMMOS MGDS GIF with the exception of The rate had some trouble staying in lock it appears the TGC TCA was not metering the data Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being MVT Mission Verification Test of the TGC TCA system is expected to begin May TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday April the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows Distance from Earth km AU Distance from Sun km AU Heliocentric Speed km per hour Distance from Jupiter km Round Trip Light Time minutes seconds SPECIAL TOPIC As of April a total of real time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Of these were initiated in the sequence design process and initiated in the real time command In the past week real time commands were transmitted were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference uplink the EJ sequence memory load and reset the command loss Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos Being cynical never helps Pasadena CA to correct the situation and causes more aggravation
