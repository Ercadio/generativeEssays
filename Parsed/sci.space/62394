from mary shafer subject re who is henry spencer anyway on sat, may 45:54 gmt, (hans kinwel) said: hans> as somebody replied on whether the space shuttle is connected to
hans> usenet: "no. of course the main flow of information would be up,
hans> unless henry spencer would be aboard, in which case the main
hans> flow of information would be down." gene miya says that henry will never go aloft in the shuttle; the
payload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies. when henry was here at dryden, he was looking pretty covetously at the
sr-71s and the f-104s, even though they don't have much cookie space.
i guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....
