From Ron Baalke Subject Ozone GIFs Available OZONE GIF IMAGES April Two GIF images of the ozone maps over the northern and southern hemispheres are now available at the JPL Info public access These maps were produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite UARS and are courtesy of the Public Information Office at Note that the images are in format so make sure your display software supports this format as opposed to the older format The caption files accompanying the images are appended at the end of this message as well as being embedded in the The images are available by dialup modem at up to bps parameters N or by using anonymous ftp to ftp user anonymous cd news will be moved to the images directory in days files Northern hemisphere Southern hemisphere Also photographic prints of these images can be ordered from Newell Color Lab listed Refer to the P number associated with the images when Newell Color Lab Westmoreland Avenue Los Angeles CA Telephone FAX PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA TELEPHONE PHOTO P April This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide and ozone over Earth's northern hemisphere in February and These maps were produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research The chlorine monoxide ClO maps left are for a layer about kilometers feet above the Earth's surface on February above and below The ozone maps show the total amount above an altitude of about kilometers feet averaged over the period from February to March for the two The Microwave Limb Sounder developed and operated by a team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is one of several instruments on the Goddard Space Flight Center's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite launched in September PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA TELEPHONE PHOTO CAPTION P April This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide ClO and the Antarctic ozone These maps produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite show the amount of chlorine monoxide left and ozone right in the stratosphere at altitudes above kilometers feet Very small abundances of ozone appear where there are large abundances of chlorine monoxide the dominant form of chlorine that destroys Data from September top are compared with those from September bottom The Microwave Limb Sounder developed and operated by a team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is one of several instruments on Goddard Space Flight Center's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite launched September Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos Being cynical never helps Pasadena CA to correct the situation and causes more aggravation
