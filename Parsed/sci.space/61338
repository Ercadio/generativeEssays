From Pat Subject Re Gamma Ray WHere are Well I seem to have struck an interesting discussion Given that I am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i'll have to boil it down a ALl the data on bursts to date shows a smooth random that means they aren't concentrated in galactic cores our or someone If the distribution is smooth we are either seeing some ENORMOUSLY large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena OR we are seeing some phenomena out at like the Oort cloud but then it needs some potent little energy source that isn't detectable by any other current we know it's not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurements on the the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the what i am wondering is this in people's opinion A NEW Physics Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric Copernicus started looking at irregularities in planetary Is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics just a little speculative thinking pat
