from henry spencer subject re temperature of the dark sky in article stupendous man writes henry, if i read you correctly, you may be asking "if i put a blackbody
>in interstellar space ('disregarding the sun and nearby large warm objects'),
>what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
>radiation field?" basically the right question, although i was interested in cases closer
to home where the sun is behind either a natural object or effective
shielding. > if that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and >molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far
>from being blackbodies...
> inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit
>from place to place... good point (and thanks for the references).
