Subject Re Surviving Large Accelerations From Lan Pham Amruth Laxman al andrew cmu edu writes Hi, I was reading through The Spaceflight Handbook and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of g He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published in have already withstood accelerations of g All this is very long winded but here's my question finally Are g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of course If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration Can this be extended to larger accelerations are you sure g is the right number as far as i know, pilots are blackout in dives that exceed g g g seems to be out of human tolerance would anybody clarify this please lan Thanks is advance Amruth Laxman
