From Wyatt Miler Subject Diaspar Virtual Reality Network Announcement Posted to the Internet by The Lunar Tele operation Model One By David Mitchell March INTRODUCTION In order to increase public interest in space based and lunar operations a real miniature lunar like environment is being constructed on which to test tele operated These models are remotely controlled by individuals located world wide using their personal computers for EduTainment Not only does this provide a test bed for simple tele operation and tele presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony tele operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty First century remote learning Because of the nature of the project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and In operation is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele operate real models at the base for experimental or recreational Because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups tele operations and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game developers manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains children the child in all of us OVERALL DESIGN A room feet by feet contains the base lunar The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the The floor is the simulated lunar A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine The initial design has tele operated machinelets An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and A moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on A personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes and also return control The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are The user will receive an image once every to seconds depending on the speed of their data link to Next an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and Finally some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped The entire initial will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software By taking a graphically oriented communications program Dmodem and adding a tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under man PLAN OF ACTION The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that Diaspar is providing the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar Diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV Diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines An initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo session and news conference on April The initial models will be put in A time lapse record will be started for historical It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to images for distribution world wide to major online networks and bbs' A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be Universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony Field trips to can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the Contributors will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return to their A monthly newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the Any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news Having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television Especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the Science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar Using counter weight and pulley systems gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction The long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars CONCLUSION EduTainment is the blending of education and Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation By creating a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in MOONLIGHTERS Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar The following people are already engaged in various parts of this work Dash Hyson Vril Wyatt The Dark One Tiggertoo The Mad Hatter Sir Robin Come join the discussion any Friday night from to midnight PST
