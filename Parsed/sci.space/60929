From Jurriaan Wittenberg Subject Re Magellan Update In APR Ron Baalke writes Forwarded from Doug Griffith, Magellan Project Manager MAGELLAN STATUS REPORT April , Magellan has completed orbits of Venus and is now days from the end of Cycle and the start of the Transition Experiment Sorry I think I missed a bit of info on this Transition Experiment What is it On Monday morning, April , the moon will occult Venus and interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about minutes Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on BTW When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan Not that I am looking forward to that day but I am just curious I believe it had something to do with the funding from the goverment or rather NO funding ok that's it for now See you guys around, Jurriaan JHWITTEN CS RUU NL Jurriaan Wittenberg Department of ComputerScience Utrecht The Netherlands
