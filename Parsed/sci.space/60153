|nope. the decisive triumph of the area rule was when convair's yf-102 --
|contractually commmitted to being a mach 1.5 fighter and actually found
|to be incapable of going supersonic in level flight -- was turned into
|the area-ruled yf-102a which met the specs. this was well before either
|the 727 or the fb-111; the 102 flew in late 1953, and convair spent most
|of the first half of 1954 figuring out what went wrong and most of the
|second half building the first 102a.

| - kipling | utzoo!henry good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there. i seem to recall, somebody built or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
passenger civil transport. i thought it was a 727, but maybe it
was a dc- 8,9??? sure it had a funny passenger compartment,
but on the other hand it seemed to save fuel. i thought area rules applied even before transonic speeds, just
not as badly. pat
