From Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for Days In article Pat writes In article writes In article Pat writes In article Greg Moore writes After all the space walking they are going to re boost the HST's I think right now it's sitting at miles up they would like I don't know the exact orbit As Ben says this re boost idea is all news to us Do you know something we don't Please supply a source it would be nice for the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to These altitude numbers are also way My best source has Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is Kilometers Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is Kilometers Delta ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is Kilometers PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base used to schedule In order to perform the re boost of the HST the OMS engines will be fired for a long Now the shuttle is a heavy THe HST isn't light THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost both HST and SHUttle for a given orbital Could you supply some calculations You might check some recent postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does not now exist so comparing the mass of something that doesn't exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems The contamination threat also or the HST could even get placed into some sort of medium The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing and longer drag Longer drag life I can understand but could you explain the antenna pointing Whatever it is the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on HST Tell me about Although the arrays can be and are moved perfectly well utilizing the second electronics Getting them both working is much desireable so as to reclaim pat I don't mean to jump on you helpful suggestions are always welcome and we all know the more ideas the better but I do want the true situation to be described clearly and correctly lest some get Regards Hathaway
