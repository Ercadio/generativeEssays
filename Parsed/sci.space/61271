From Phil Fraering Subject Re Gamma Ray Where are they writes These tests all show that the bursts have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of homogeneity they do not clump in any one So unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these Now I suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the Well not Remember we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto pioneer so we should be able with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to Here's an analogy You see a plane You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which is the same as The two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a To my knowledge no one has been able to do Uh These burst detectors are just that burst They have no angular Now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort cloud or We have one network and trying to make two networks out of it degrades what angular resolution we Phil Fraering Seems like every day we find out all sorts of Like how the ancient Mayans had Repo Man
