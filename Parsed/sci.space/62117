From Bill Higgins Beam Jockey Subject Why we like DC X was Re Shuttle Defects Bizarre DC X Ken Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you're tackling Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs Good luck In article Ken Hayashida writes Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences and medical related The Russians are in the Free World now or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend I am hopeful that DC X or whatever the follow on is eventually called will perform as you But right now I must admit that I am more skeptical than It will be tough to make DC X succeed and to turn it into an operational orbital Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the only chance we have now or will have for a long time to come to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower There is no Shuttle successor in funded development NASP is dwindling away and ALS NLS Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that per pound Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the er Free World's available space As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to DC X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental X plane It's been to my mind incredibly successful already they've built a complex prototype in under days for under I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in America never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or building the DC I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of I don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs for multi ton payloads anywhere If the DC flops it'll be business as usual in The Nineties and the Double Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties a prospect too depressing to Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different It doesn't lower cost per pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten It's creating its own market for small I read the magazines and I've attended the last two There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some of them as good as or better than There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly You could change my view on DC X if you could prove the following some things I'm not going to prove that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man ratable DC X successor Is anybody seriously proposing this References The DC must be developed in the real world funding climate which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations as well as the bird in the hand argument your common sense tells If DC Y flies at all it flies alongside the Shuttle not instead of Also of course DC Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are not man Most importantly that the DC X will open up LEO to more scientific and technical If a DC X successor can fly a kg payload for or even rather than the it now costs more people will be able to afford more for the same money you can fly several satellites instead of Big outfits can fly multi satellite Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of begging a This is just supply and You should be able to convince yourself that point will be true assuming DC makes a big difference in Do you have some reason to think not O ' ' ' zap Bill Higgins Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Bitnet HIGGINS Internet HIGGINS SPAN Hepnet HIGGINS
