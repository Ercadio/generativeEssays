From Josh Hopkins Subject DC Y trajectory simulation I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of I've transcribed some of my notes Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are Permission is granted to copy this without Note for newbies The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit reusable launch The DC X vehicle is a scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in It is currently undergoing The DC Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching It has not yet been On April Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions here at the University of Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project he has spent time with them recently using his software for their He thus used the DC Y project for most of his While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers I hope they aren't I fell asleep during that part I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but I did not verify The Delta Clipper Y version has engines boosters and The boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in mid Thus one critical question is when to shut them Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time G As ASCII graphs go this is actually fairly The big difference is that the lines G made by the should be curves which are concave The data is only approximate as the graph wasn't up for very G G sec sec As mentioned before a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below Initially all eight engines are As the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration As it gets close to the booster engines are throtled However they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off This causes the dip in accelleration at about Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about and then hold it there until they cut out The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to that Questions from the audience paraphrased Q Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than all at once A Very Worth They have not yet done the Shutting down all four was part of the problem as Q So what was the final payload for this trajectory A Can't tell Read Aviation He also apparently had a good propulsion example but was told not to use My question Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests The second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and the parameter they were trying to maximize was He showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC the DC Y would have about degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about degrees south I would have asked about the landing maneuvers but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight Josh Hopkins Find a way or make attributed to Hannibal
