From Jon Leech Subject Space FAQ Mission Schedules Archive name space schedule Last modified Date SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS LAUNCH SCHEDULES TV COVERAGE SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group and Ken Hollis posts a compressed version of the shuttle manifest launch dates and other information periodically The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE FAQ The portion of his manifest formerly included in this FAQ has been removed please refer to his posting or the archived For the most up to date information on upcoming missions call INFO at Kennedy Space Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual ASC G C says During the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I loaded V rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is Then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved S band look angles and crew view of the The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff MECO target in second This really is a good answer but it's couched in NASA I'll try to We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before Then we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha This causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the Orbiter or the Z direction and this force alleviates structural We have to be careful about those wings they're about the most delicate part of the The new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll performance gain The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the Return To Launch Site decreased abort maneuver complexity The new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the S band radio antennae on the Orbiter improved S band look angles The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve Remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain This all begs the question Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine You can see the effects of this on any daytime The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white Watch for the difference between the top Orbiter side and the bottom External Tank side of the The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn V' A side note the Saturn V's also had a roll Don't ask me why I'm a Shuttle I checked with a buddy in Ascent He added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight The yaw component is used to determine the orbital The total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL NASA SELECT NASA SELECT is broadcast by If you have access to a satellite dish you can find SELECT on Satcom Transponder C Band degrees West Longitude Audio Frequency is stationed over the Atlantic and is increasingly difficult to receive from California and points During events of special interest shuttle missions SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite for these If you can't get a satellite feed some cable operators carry It's worth asking if yours doesn' The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is frequently posted to Generally it carries press conferences briefings by NASA officials and live coverage of shuttle missions and planetary SELECT has recently begun carrying much more secondary material associated with SPACELINK when missions are not being AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle
