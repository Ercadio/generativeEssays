From Jordan Katz Subject Space Foundation Speech Speech by Pete Worden Delivered Before the Space Foundation Conference Colorado Springs Colorado April What a delightful opportunity to cause some For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the Space My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or By I intend to speak of How to lower the cost and make rapid SSRT is to my mind and I hope to convince you the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space Faster Cheaper and Faster Cheaper Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to It is a new thing to be sure but it is also a relearning of old things from past When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics it made no For example Eberhart Rachtin former president of the Aerospace said of SSRT in the Times that it defies the best principles of launching payloads into Well Rachtin you've made us mad What are these principles that SSRT defies Well I'll tell It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space It violates the fact that it takes years to build something And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new old Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to And the X airplane didn't cost It took one of the great engineers of the 's to remind us of these truths Max Max to remind you was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program and old faster better cheaper success Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the ' Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps Build a little Test a Next he persuaded us to do a technology We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements they'd just change every few years not included in the speech The ALS NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as Shape Shifter than Space We didn't spend a lot money this X Rocket only cost When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that And it didn't take a lot of time to build McDonnell Douglas completed it in Finally the government program office consisted of one very over worked Air Force Major motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped on lawn chair if it ran over cost or As I described what SSRT is and isn't keep in mind its only a first There are several more steps and steps that can easily fail before the can field an But each step should follow the same principles a small management team a few years technology demonstration and a modest Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve See charts I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation the giants of the last great space era the 's and ' They went to the moon we built a telescope that can't see They soft landed on Mars the least we could do is soft land on Earth But we do have an We can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to I know there are nay sayers among you those who say SSRT is a It needs more thermal protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land horizontally etc I say to you we'll see you at White Sands in You bring your view graphs and I'll bring my If we do what we say we can do then you let us do the next not included in the speech If we fail you still have your program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and decade long I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea Any Takers
