From Ron Baalke Subject Iapetus Saturn Eclipse Forwarded from John Spencer There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings in May and Please spread the word Here's some information about the events and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of He might also have some money John Spencer Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on UT and again on UT Timing is as follows May A ring ingress egress B ring ingress egress C ring egress Saturn ingress egress B ring ingress egress A ring ingress egress July Saturn ingress egress A ring ingress grazing egress Times could be minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the See Soma Astronomy and Astrophysics for more Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my THERMAL OBSERVATIONS Jay Goguen jdg writes To me the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the July disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia Unfortunately the UT of this event renders it inaccessible except from Even from Calar Alto Saturn is rising through airmasses at Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with a big telescope and um instrumentation that's looking for something to do I'd be willing to make a personal grant of for the Jay and again please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal My impression would be that it's not an easy Iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse so you'll need a big telescope that's a good IR telescope and reasonable um I don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for We need SOFIA for this One possibility would be the IR telescope in India but it's only a jay Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos The aweto from New Zealand Pasadena CA is part caterpillar and part
