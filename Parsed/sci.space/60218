From Pat Subject Re Comet in Temporary Orbit Around Jupiter In article Ron Baalke writes Comet Gehrels which was discovered in was determined to have been in a temporary Jovian orbit from to Comet Shoemaker Levy may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to make some closeup The orbital trajectory for Comet Shoemaker Levy is still being a What about positional uncertainties in S L I assume we know where and what Galileo is doing within a few But without the HGA don't we have to have some pretty good ideas of where to look before imaging If the HGA was working they could slew around in near real time Less speed of light delay But when they were imaging toutatis didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images Also I imagine S L will be mostly a visual so how will that affect the other imaging with the LGA there is a real tight allocation of It may be premature to hope for answers but I thought i'd throw it on the pat
