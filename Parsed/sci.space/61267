Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters How energetic could they be From In article senator John F Carr writes If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic would absorption from the galaxy be expected How transparent is the galactic core to gamma rays How much energy does a burster put out I know energy depends on distance which is An answer of the form X ergs per megaparsec is John Carr I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this little I don't have a calculator but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago so I'll use that and hope it's what you This is a highly simplified problem with a very simple Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use Our burst has a peak flux of ergs cm sec and a duration of During the frst second of the burst and the last seconds its flux is half of the peak It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the Assume that the background flux is erg cm sec Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several different spheres R Oort Cloud Radius R at the edge of the galaxy R or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a R We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the old standby formula Luminosity pi r Fpeak For a radius of pc we found an L around erg Pretty energetic for close for the coronal model we found around erg And lastly for the cosmological model an L That's what you'd call moderately energetic I'd Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy
