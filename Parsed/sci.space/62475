 hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using 
 adaptive optics at the 5 m at palomar for near-infrared 
 observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.

 and isn't the ntt already pushing toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution, 
 from a ground-based site (remember 0.1 arcseconds was one of the 
 selling points of hst).
