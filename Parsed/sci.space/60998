From nickh Nick Haines Subject Re Level In article C Tom writes Nick Haines sez given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level in maturity I strongly doubt that this having lots of bugs is the case Level Out of how many What are the different levels I've never heard of this rating Anyone care to clue me in This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a software process' the entire process by which software gets designed written tested delivered supported See Managing the Software Process' by Watts Humphrey Addison Wesley An excellent software engineering The levels of software process maturity are Initial Repeatable Defined Managed Optimizing The levels are approximately characterized as follows no statistically software process Have no statistical basis for estimating how large software will be how long it will take to produce how expensive it will be or how reliable it will Most software production is at this stable process with statistical controls rigorous project management having done something once can do it Projects are planned in detail and there is software configuration management and quality The process is defined and understood implementation is This includes things like software inspection a rigorous software testing framework more configuration management and typically a software engineering process group' within the Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered and analysed and the process is controlled on the basis of this Software quality is measured and has Defects are prevented the process is automated software contracts are effective and Nick Haines
