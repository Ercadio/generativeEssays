From Ron Baalke Subject Re Comet in Temporary Orbit Around Jupiter In article psfan , Pat writes In article APR Ron Baalke writes Comet Gehrels , which was discovered in , was determined to have been in a temporary Jovian orbit from to Comet Shoemaker Levy e may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to make some closeup observations The orbital trajectory for Comet Shoemaker Levy is still being determined a What about positional uncertainties in S L e If Comet Shoemaker Levy e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will be added to the list of targets We'll have by then over two years of Earth based observations to help narrow down the positions of the pieces of the comet It probably won't be too much different than what was done with Gaspra But when they were imaging toutatis Galileo did not image Toutatis That came from Earth based radar Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos Being cynical never helps Pasadena, CA to correct the situation and causes more aggravation instead
