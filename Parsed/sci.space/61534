From Pat Subject Re Space Manuevering Tug was HST servicing mission In article Josh Hopkins writes Pat writes Given that what i described for the HST seemed to be the SMT and given the mass amrgins on the discovery mission is tight enough that spacewalking has to be carefully No EDO pallets no spare Suits no extra MMU' Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins on the HST re boost A while back i had asked why not carry the EDO pallet up and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they weren't even carrying extra WHy not do this Quick Test Goldins philosophjy of faster cheaper Build a real fast Space TUg to handle the re boost of the HST using clean Cryo fuels and get it ready before the HST Pat this would be slower more expensive and Slower The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in That's less than eight months There is no way you could build new hardware retrain and reschedule the EVA's in that Where's wingo when you need him COme Knock that S T YOu forget that during skylab they did overnight mission planning for the repair EVA' Also during the Intelsat Mission they did overnight WETF I somehow think they could train up a new EVA in And as for building hardware anything can be built if you want it bad YOu forget the BUS is already all they'd ahve to do is soup it up even test it on a delta Don't get into this mode of besides at the rate missions slip the Discovery won't launch on this mission until that's almost a More Expensive Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the In addition you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex Ah but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing YOu forget there is a bum FGS the Solar array electronics are getting hinky and there is still months until the servicing The time for the space walks are growing THis was orignally planned out as spacewalks now they are at EVA's with reserve If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's million If the Weight savings means they can sit on orbit for and handle any contingency problems that's quite a According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle HST and Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle there doesn't seem to be any need for your Of course there wasn't any need for the Saturn V after apollo as for the problems with the aperture door I am sure they can work out some way to handle Maybe a Plug made from Frozen it'll keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh pat
