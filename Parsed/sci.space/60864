From Allen Sherzer Subject Re NASA Wraps In article wingo writes I don't care who told you this it is not generally I see EVERY single line item on a contract and I have to sign There is no such thing as wrap at this Dennis I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of Customers included government including NASA for profit and non profit All expected a wrap usually called a fee Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of The subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of ALL charged fees as part of the Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers they charge a Now I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis but you clearly lack experience in several Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for This isn't a flame jsut a Your employer DOES charge a You may not see it but you Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead Go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the Well there you are As I said they simply include the fee in their Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the No Allen you did You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of Integration Dennis isn't Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers where the work is going Dennis Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce When WP was hemoraging out a billion the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is When you have a bit more experience Dennis you will realize that integration isn't It is the single most important part of a successful large scale Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being selective with the facts The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Suprise The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a You stated that your friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for That comes from the Shuttle What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do Allen's math for him for a I will have little chance to do I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP be Allen Lady Astor Sir if you were my husband I would poison your coffee Churchill Madam if you were my wife I would drink DAYS TO FIRST FLIGHT OF DCX
