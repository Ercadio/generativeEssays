From Craig Keithley Subject Re Moonbase race NASA resources why In article Henry Spencer wrote The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply for more than a brief visit at least is low cost transport to Earth For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a Ah there's the And a catch to For the purposes of a contest you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new Course if a low priced system existed there might be I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work For example would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines And so Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on In other words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support navigation could be developed prior to a low cost launch You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac oops I mean launch system comes on I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next years then perhaps its not 'wasted' If your goal is to explore the moon for under million then you should put of this exploration for a decade or Craig Craig Keithley I don't remember I don't recall Apple Computer I got no memory of anything at all Peter Gabriel Third Album
