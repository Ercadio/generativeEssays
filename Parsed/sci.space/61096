From Ron Baalke Subject Galileo Update Forwarded from Neal Ausman Galileo Mission Director GALILEO MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT POST LAUNCH April SPACECRAFT On April cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer MAG Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received On April a Command Detector Unit Signal to Noise Ratio CDUSNR test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control RFSAGC test were performed using the LGA Low Gain Antenna over DSS Madrid meter antenna and DSS Madrid meter antenna Data analysis is in These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware On April a NO OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours its planned value during this mission On April the first of two suppressed carrier DSN Deep Space Network advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS Goldstone meter antenna The spacecraft modulation index was varied from degrees to degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change greater than DN throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement The AC measurement reads DN volts The DC measurement has ranged from DN volts to DN volts and currently reads DN volts These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC DC special anomaly The Spacecraft status as of April is as follows a System Power Margin watts b Spin Configuration Dual Spin c Spin Rate Sensor Star Scanner d Spacecraft Attitude is approximately degrees off sun lagging and degrees off earth leading e Downlink telemetry rate antenna coded LGA f General Thermal Control all temperatures within acceptable range g RPM Tank Pressures all within acceptable range h Orbiter Science Instruments powered on are the PWS EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS i Probe RRH powered off temperatures within acceptable range j CMD Loss Timer Setting hours Time To Initiation hours TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday April the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows Distance from Earth km AU Distance from Sun km AU Heliocentric Speed km per hour Distance from Jupiter km Round Trip Light Time minutes seconds SPECIAL TOPIC As of April a total of real time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Of these were initiated in the sequence design process and initiated in the real time command In the past week one real time command was transmitted one was initiated in the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command The only command activity was a command to reset the command loss Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos The aweto from New Zealand Pasadena CA is part caterpillar and part
