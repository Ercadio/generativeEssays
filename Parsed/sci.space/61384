From David Palmer Subject Re Gamma Ray WHere are Pat writes we know it's not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurements on the We can only say that they are beyond about AU due to the low accuracy of position determination by single what i am wondering is this in people's opinion A NEW Physics Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric Copernicus started looking at irregularities in planetary Is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics just a little speculative thinking It may be a NEW Physics problem a problem involving new physics However the data is not good enough to rule out the models which use old New physics is a big step and is only tolerated when there is no For example the Dark Matter Problem there's more to the universe than meets the eye is a question of comparable mystery to GRBs but we have much better data regarding Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an experimentalist or several detects them in the David Palmer
