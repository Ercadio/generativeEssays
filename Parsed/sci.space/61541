From Greg Howard Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters How energetic could they be In article A writes In article rgvjsINNbhq senator bedfellow MIT EDU , John F Carr writes How much energy does a burster put out I know energy depends on distance, which is unknown An answer of the form X ergs per megaparsec is OK different spheres R pc Oort Cloud Radius , R pc at the edge of the galaxy , R pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R Mpc For a radius of pc, we found an L around erg sec Pretty energetic for close by for the coronal model, we found around erg sec And lastly, for the cosmological model an L That's what you'd call moderately energetic, I'd say Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy Supernovae put out or i forget which, but it's only an order of magnitude Not in gamma rays, though You'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at Mpc, but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic but closer than Mpc I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think of how to get many gammas out Maybe I should look it up Big radio galaxies can put out erg s continually That's just in the radio there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but bursts Nah Neither of these should be taken as explanations just trying to show that those energies are produced by things we know about greg
