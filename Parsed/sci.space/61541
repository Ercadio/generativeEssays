From Greg Howard Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters How energetic could they be In article writes In article senator John F Carr writes How much energy does a burster put out I know energy depends on distance which is An answer of the form X ergs per megaparsec is different spheres R Oort Cloud Radius R at the edge of the galaxy R or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a R For a radius of pc we found an L around erg Pretty energetic for close for the coronal model we found around erg And lastly for the cosmological model an L That's what you'd call moderately energetic I'd Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy Supernovae put out or i forget which but it's only an order of Not in gamma rays You'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at Mpc but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic but closer than Mpc I dunno SN theory so well but I can't think of how to get many gammas Maybe I should look it Big radio galaxies can put out erg s continually That's just in the there are a lot of gammas around them too but bursts Neither of these should be taken as just trying to show that those energies are produced by things we know greg
