From Josh Hopkins Subject Re Space Manuevering Tug was HST servicing mission Pat writes I wrote Pat writes Given that what i described for the HST seemed to be the SMT Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins on the HST re boost A while back i had asked why not carry the EDO pallet up and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they weren't even carrying extra So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS That's the critical My data shows that the OMS engines hold kg of Of that a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry burn and the So Pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS and extra parts are going If you can make the numbers work out then I'll be After you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS and extra equipment is going to WHy not do this Quick Test Goldins philosophjy of faster cheaper Build a real fast Space TUg to handle the re boost of the HST using clean Cryo fuels and get it ready before the HST Pat this would be slower more expensive and Where's wingo when you need him COme Knock that S T YOu forget that during skylab they did overnight mission planning for the repair EVA' Also during thexD Intelsat Mission they did overnight WETF I somehow think they could train up a new EVA in First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was because they had They don't like to do that as a general Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more Third they don't have eight They have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it You may think I have a pessimistic I think it's I'm not saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA And as for building hardware anything can be built if you want it bad YOu forget the BUS is already all they'd ahve to do is soup it up even test it on a delta All they have to do is soup it up Just what does that mean Don't get into this mode of besides at the rate missions slip the Discovery won't launch on this mission until that's almost a More Expensive Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the In addition you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex Ah but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing The second servicing mission is a You have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your YOu forget there is a bum FGS the Solar array electronics are getting hinky and there is still months until the servicing No Pat I haven't If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's million No That's million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement costs minus extra operating According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle HST and Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle there doesn't seem to be any need for your Of course there wasn't any need for the Saturn V after apollo I'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is as for the problems with the aperture door I am sure they can work out some way to handle Maybe a Plug made from Frozen it'll keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's made to perform this task it also ignores the There is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done about Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door you haven't solved the Josh Hopkins Find a way or make attributed to Hannibal
