From wingo Subject Re NASA Wraps In article Allen Sherzer In article wingo writes I don't care who told you this it is not generally I see EVERY single line item on a contract and I have to sign There is no such thing as wrap at this Dennis I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of Customers included government including NASA for profit and non profit All expected a wrap usually called a fee Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of The subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of ALL charged fees as part of the Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers they charge a You totally forgot the original post that you posted In that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not Now I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis but you clearly lack experience in several Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for This isn't a flame jsut a Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know Your employer DOES charge a You may not see it but you Of course there is a It is for Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not Which is it Allen Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead Go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the Well there you are As I said they simply include the fee in their Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the As you have posted on this subject Allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate You admit here that this is Nasa has a line item budget every I have seen it Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about Until you do that you are barking in the No Allen you did You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of Integration Dennis isn't Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers where the work is going Integration could be done better at the Apollo integration was done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to There is no way that will ever It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried Could you imagine a Reston like set up for Apollo Dennis Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce When WP was hemoraging out a billion the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a Oh you are full of it Allen on this I agree that JSC screwed up They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really Maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the facts are contrary to Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is When you have a bit more experience Dennis you will realize that integration isn't It is the single most important part of a successful large scale I agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the It is called leadership That is what made Apollo Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than That is leadership and There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs Lack of leadership from the White House Congress and at Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems Methinks that you are being selective with the facts The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Suprise The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns No I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have happened in the first If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a You stated that your friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone This merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for That comes from the Shuttle What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do Allen's math for him for a I will have little chance to do I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP be I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
