From Dennis Chamberlin Subject Re PLANETS STILL IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWIST News saved at Apr GMT In article A David McAloon writes ETHER IMPLODES EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe orbital motion Light Years between galaxies is a misnomer The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion defining edge ether spin To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history Well, I'm working on it, but getting a little impatient So far, I've made it through Egyptian, Chinese, and Greek cultures, and up through the Rennaisance But so far, these insights just don't seem to be gelling Perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere In its own right, though, the history is kind of fun Lots of good yarns in there, with varied and interesting characters And, more to come
