is. on the x-15 the aerodynamic control surfaces (elevator, rudder, etc)
were conventionally controlled (pushrods and cables) but the rcs jets
were fly-by-wire. |the nasa habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using

on the hangar deck. the f-14 wings sweep, all the rest fold the
wingtips up at a joint. air force planes don't have folding wings, since the air force has
lots of room. --
