From Steve Derry Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for Days Pat wrote THe limit on space walking is a function of suit supplies MASS and Orbiter In order to perform the re boost of the HST the OMS engines will be fired for a long Now the shuttle is a heavy THe HST isn't light THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost both HST and SHUttle for a given orbital From what i understand the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU' pat I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission but I can't see why the mass margins are What are they carrying up Replacement components WFPC II COSTAR gyros solar panels and probably a few others all sorts of tools EVA equipment and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they This should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission which achieved the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to And HST is now in a lower Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission Steve Derry
