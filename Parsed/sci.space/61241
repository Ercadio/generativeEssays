From PPORTH Tricia Porth Subject Remote Sensing Data I am posting this for someone Please respond to the address listed Please also excuse the duplication as this message has been Thanks REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES VIA THE INTERNET NASA is planning to expand the domain of users of its Earth and space science This effort will o Use the evolving infrastructure of the Global Change Research Program including the Mission To Planet Earth MTPE and the Earth Observing System Data and Information System EOSDIS o Use the Internet particularly the High Performance Computing and Communications Program's NREN National Research and Education Network as a means of providing access to and distribution of science data and images and value added o Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in cooperation with other agencies especially NOAA EPA DOE DEd DOI USGS and USDA o Support remote sensing image and data users and development The user and development communities to be included but not limited to as part of this effort are educators commercial application developers television weather forecasters librarians publishers agriculture specialists transportation forestry state and local government planners and aqua This program will be initiated in Your assistance is requested to identify potential applications of remote sensing images and We would like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of the Implementation PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR We are seeking your ideas in these areas Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in education especially levels K and other noncommercial areas Types of on line capabilities and protocols to make the data more accessible Additional points of contacts for ideas and Addresses and names from whom to request For your convenience a standard format for responses is included Feel free to amend it as Either e mail or fax your responses to us by May E MAIL On Internet ASCII No binary attachments please FAX Ernie Lucier c o RSDWG NASA HQ FAX Survey responses in the following formats may also be placed in the FTP directory ftp pub RSDWG on Please indicate the Acceptable formats are Word for Windows Macintosh Word and and RESPONSE FORMAT REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES VIA THE INTERNET Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images if possible identify the relevant types of data or science products user tools and standards Uses of remote sensing data and images in education especially levels K and other noncommercial areas if possible identify the relevant types of data or science products user tools and standards Types of on line capabilities and protocols to make the data and images more accessible if possible identify relevant types of formats standards and user tools Additional suggested persons or organizations that may be resources for further ideas on applications Please include Name Organization Address and Telephone Organizations mailing lists electronic and paper periodicals to whom a solicitation for proposals should be sent when Please include Name Organization Address and Telephone We would benefit from knowing why users that know about NASA remote sensing data do not use the Is it because they do not have ties to NASA investigators or high cost lack of accessibility incompatible data formats poor area of interest coverage inadequate spatial or spectral resolution In case we have questions please send us your name address phone number and e mail address if you have one If you don't wish to send us this information feel free to respond to the survey Thank you for your
