NASA ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV Centaur in October of After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of Upon arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and The objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of Saturn's satellites and characterize Titan's atmosphere and One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini the first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of Saturn's satellites and the major division in its The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn's Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission

Launched on a Titan III TOS MO is currently in transit to Mars arriving on Operations will start for one martian year days TOPEX Poseidon Joint US French Earth observing satellite launched on an Ariane The primary objective of the TOPEX POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years substantially increasing understanding of global ocean The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ULYSSES European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its Launched in late it carries particles and fields experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers but no Since no human built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity assist manuver in February This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about degrees to the It will pass over the Sun's south pole in the summer of Its aphelion is AU and surprisingly its perihelion is about AU that's right a solar studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is While in Jupiter's neigborhood Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation For a short summary of these results see Science September For gory technical detail

changes based on updated shuttle manifests corrections and updates are Missions o ALEXIS spring Pegasus ALEXIS Array of Low Energy X ray Imaging Sensors is to perform a wide field sky survey in the soft low energy X ray It will scan the entire sky every six months to search for variations in soft X ray emission from sources such as white dwarfs cataclysmic variable stars and flare It will also search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron stars and gamma ray ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development mission that uses
