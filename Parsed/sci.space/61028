From hdsteven Stevens Subject Re Proton Centaur In article Dennis Newkirk writes In article James Thomas Green writes Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a Proton Centaur combo What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other than the obvious instability in the XSSR now The Centaur for the Altas is about meters and the Proton is so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage the Block D which sets inside a shround just under meters I don't know about launch loads but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good it seems EXCEPT the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available Protons are assembled and transported Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad The Centaur that is being built for would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the It is also closer to m in You've hit on the real kicker The Centaur is pressure It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the Additionally the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the On numerous occasions when I was there the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non pressure stabilized The answer a centaur not worth The Atlas Centaur does not require on pad integration however the Centaur I believe the on pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration so maybe something can be done They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads unless the new Proton second stage is actually built and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the US at great These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you The addition of LOX LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts A LHe facility is also I don't know what the proton uses for fuel but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's If there is no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these systems could be big not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to That issue alone might be enough to kill this Stevens Stanford University Email Aerospace Robotics Laboratory Phone Lab Durand Building Bullpen Stanford CA Fax
