from kerry todd johnson subject army in space is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the army that deal with space after i graduate, i will have a commitment to serve in the army, and i would like to spend it in a space-related field. i saw a post a long
time ago about the air force space command which made a fleeting reference to
its army counter-part. any more info on that would be appreciated. i'm looking for things like: do i branch intelligence, or signal, or other? to
whom do i voice my interest in space? what qualifications are necessary?
etc, etc. btw, my major is computer science engineering. please reply to thanks for any info.
