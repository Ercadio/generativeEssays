from henry spencer subject re moonbase race in article tom writes on the other hand, if apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks
>in space, in 1970 dollars, then won't the reward have to be a lot more
>than only 1 billion to get any takers? apollo was done the hard way, in a big hurry, from a very limited
technology base... and on government contracts. just doing it privately,
rather than as a government project, cuts costs by a factor of several.
