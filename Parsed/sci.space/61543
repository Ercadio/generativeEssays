From Isaac Kuo Subject Re Electrical Spacecraft via Magnetic field of earth In article writes Okay the earth has a magnetic field unless someone missed something Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces No if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or move the The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't really significant especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic field is to begin Now the Can you use electricity to power a space low earth orbit vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it Well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth's magnetic field as a magnet can repel another magnet Of course this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably Magnetic repulsion drops off as r and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very It would require some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic And seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps And the physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in our blood among other things In other words forget Can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the electrical field After all the dragless satellite is I might be wrong a suspended between to pilons the the pilons compensate for I think I know what I want to say just not sure how to say A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a I missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus from this little Isaac Kuo o Twinkle twinkle little Keep it less than lines
