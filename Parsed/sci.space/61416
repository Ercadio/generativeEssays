From Ron Baalke Subject Galileo Update Forwarded from Neal Ausman Galileo Mission Director GALILEO MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT POST LAUNCH April SPACECRAFT On April and delta Differenced One way Range DOR passes were performed over DSS Goldstone Madrid meter antennas and DSS Goldstone Canberra meter antennas Initial results indicate the delta DOR pass on April was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April was successfully On April a cruise science Memory Readout MRO was performed for the Magnetometer MAG Analysis indicates the data was received On April the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored These relays were commanded closed by the CDS Command Data Subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge IESD On April cruise science Memory Readouts MRO were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer MAG Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received During the period from April to April a navigation cycle was This navigation cycle provided near continuous acquisition of two way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS DSS and DSS On April real time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna RRA in preparation for the mini sequence slew test on April The RRA was slewed from approximately degrees from stow to approximately Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about degrees which was well within the predicted The RRA was commanded back to approximately degrees from Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about degrees also well within the predicted The RRA motor temperature was at degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to degrees C at its After verifying proper RRA slewing the RRA slew test mini sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April Upon successful uplink a Delayed Action Command DAC was sent which will reposition the stator on May to its initial pre test Also a DAC was sent to turn the Two Way Noncoherent TWNC on April prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini On April a NO OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours its planned value during this mission On April the RRA slew test executed The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about degrees from stow and going to degrees back to degrees then to degrees back to degrees then to degrees and then back to All of the slews were well within the predicted The RRA motor temperature was at degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to degrees C at its After completion of the RRA slews real time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre test The AC DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change greater than DN throughout this The AC measurement reads DN volts The DC measurement reads DN volts These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC DC special anomaly The Spacecraft status as of April is as follows a System Power Margin watts b Spin Configuration Dual Spin c Spin Rate Sensor Star Scanner d Spacecraft Attitude is approximately degrees off sun lagging and degrees off earth leading e Downlink telemetry rate antenna coded LGA f General Thermal Control all temperatures within acceptable range g RPM Tank Pressures all within acceptable range h Orbiter Science Instruments powered on are the PWS EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS i Probe RRH powered off temperatures within acceptable range j CMD Loss Timer Setting hours Time To Initiation hours GDS Ground Data Systems The first Galileo GDS test of the MGDS Command System CMD took place April with DSS Madrid meter antenna The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN Deep Space Network Group Command Processor Assembly CPA The test was successful and the next test for CMD is scheduled for May with DSS Goldstone meter antenna The April System Engineers Monthly Report SEMR Ground System Development Office GSDO MMR was conducted Thursday April A review of current Project and Institutional DSN and MOSO system status was On going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase and delivery schedules past months accomplishments and potential problem areas were No significant schedule changes or significant problems were TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday April the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows Distance from Earth km AU Distance from Sun km AU Heliocentric Speed km per hour Distance from Jupiter km Round Trip Light Time minutes seconds SPECIAL TOPIC As of April a total of real time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Of these were initiated in the sequence design process and initiated in the real time command In the past week real time commands were transmitted were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command Major command activities included commands to perform the initial RRA slew test uplink the RRA slew test mini sequence DACs to reposition the stator and turn the TWNC on reset the command loss timer and execute the RRA slew Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos The aweto from
