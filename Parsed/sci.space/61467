From Steve Willner Subject Re temperature of the dark sky In article richmond Stupendous Man writes If that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are well not too far from being Many different observations including IRAS and COBE have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from to Interstellar grains are not at all close to The large grains have sizes of order micron and absorb visible light with fair However at temperatures below K of the thermal emission will be beyond microns where radiating efficiency is A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have Moreover the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of Grains colder than K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to In the extreme limit grains as cold as K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable Worse still IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small These grains have only perhaps atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but when they are radiating the characteristic temperature is several hundred Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust color temperature K thermal emission from Zodiacal dust Tc K and thermal emission from Galactic dust Tc K At the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively and The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic To find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth In the table below starlight comes from Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to zero mag stars with B V color of No doubt careful work could do much The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E must have been remembering We would be cooked if that were the In any event the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background and I believe that to be Dilution DT Microwave background Galactic dust Zodiacal dust emission Zodiacal dust scattering Starlight The fourth root of is Outside the Solar system the result would be I find these results surprising especially the importance of Zodiacal dust but I don't see any serious Steve Willner Phone Bitnet willner cfa Cambridge MA USA Internet member League for Programming Freedom contact
