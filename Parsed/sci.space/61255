From Eric H Seale Subject Re Surviving Large Accelerations Amruth Laxman al andrew cmu edu writes humans and this was published in have already withstood accelerations of g All this is very long winded but here's my question finally Are g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of course Lan Pham writes are you sure g is the right number as far as i know, pilots are blackout in dives that exceed g g g seems to be out of human tolerance would anybody clarify this please Actually, both numbers are correct The difference is in the direction of the acceleration For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you're facing pulling out from a steep dive, the acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance In this case, you can only put up with about g's even with a pressure suit The record for acceleration, though, is measured along the direction you're facing for lack of a better term As I recall, this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 's and was about g's or so Eric Seale
