From Jon Leech Subject Space FAQ Controversial Questions Archive name space controversy Last modified Date CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community has Please DON'T bring them up again unless there's something truly new to be The net can't set public policy that's what your representatives are WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite a widespread belief to the contrary the Saturn V blueprints have not been They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on The problem in re creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings it is finding vendors who can supply mid 's vintage hardware like guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use so you have no place to launch By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re modify the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being scooped by people uninvolved in the However NASA frequently releases examples in non digital form photos to the public early in a RISKS OF NUCLEAR RTG POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being Numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely Two interesting data points are The May loss of two SNAP RTGs which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach The fuel was recovered after months with no release of In April the Apollo lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP RTG heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to half lives of the Pu fuel or about years DOE To make your own informed judgement some

THE OZONE LAYER From time to time claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters SRBs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study Charles The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by Michael Prather NASA Goddard Institute for Space The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia NASA GISS Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze Atmospheric and Environmental Research The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine Industrial sources kilograms year Natural sources kilograms year Shuttle sources kilograms year The shuttle source assumes space shuttles and Titan rockets are launched Thus the launches would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine The effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar The influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a decrease in globally averaged ozone between and The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present Theoretical results of this study have been published in The Space Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere MJ Prather MM Garcia AR Douglass CH Jackman Ko and Sze

destroyed in an This is a well documented fact see the Rogers Commission report for What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the Kerwin team's medical forensic The astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa and their bodies then spent several weeks Their remains were recovered and after the Kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with Furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low Taking it higher is enormously costly and A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit Yet another concise answer by Henry THE FACE ON MARS There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery much more facelike in appearance and the one more often published with the Sun degrees above western horizon and with the Sun degrees from the west Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an extraterrestrial Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely Other Viking images show a smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society sorry don't know the address to study the The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high resolution camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few In the meantime speculation about the Face is best carried on in the altnet group not or DiPeitro and Molenaar Unusual Martian
