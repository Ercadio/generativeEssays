From Paul Dietz Subject Re Gamma Ray positional In article writes getting at This puppy is far enough away that if a bright burst happens nearby the huge annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given by BATSE and we can get a moderately accurate Say oh or That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with You can do a whole hell of a lot better than or degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary Ignore the directional information from BATSE just look at the time of With three detectors properly arranged one can often get positions down to arc BTW about Oort cloud sources shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future Some of the GRBs have very short rise times ms We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b t c where b is the detector spacing and t the time For t ms and b AU this is on the order of light I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong Paul
