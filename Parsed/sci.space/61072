From thomas hancock Subject Re Proton Centaur Dennis Newkirk writes The Centaur is controlled State Dept will not allow it to be used outside of In article James Thomas Green writes Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a Proton Centaur combo What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other than the obvious instability in the XSSR now I haven't seen any speculation about But the Salyut KB Design Bureau was planning a new LH LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about to Geostationary goes from Gals launcher version to This scheme was competing with the Energia M last year and I haven't heard which won except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia So the early results are Energia M won but this is a guess nothing is very clear in I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their The Centaur for the Altas is about meters and the Proton is so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage the Block D which sets inside a shround just under meters I don't know about launch loads but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good it seems EXCEPT the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available Protons are assembled and transported Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads unless the new Proton second stage is actually built and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the US at great These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you Dennis Newkirk Motorola Land Mobile Products Sector Schaumburg IL
