Subject Space FAQ Network Resources From Jon Leech Archive name space net Last modified Date NETWORK RESOURCES OVERVIEW You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers so much of the material below may not apply to In general however systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three categories Internet Usenet or Electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers' The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the In addition to the general lists for space called SPACE Digest for Internet users and SPACE on BITNET there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews' This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name' The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' and ' ' Contributors 'post' submissions called 'articles' in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby Similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was Gateway machines redirect the Usenet group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing
