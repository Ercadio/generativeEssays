From Ron Baalke Subject Re Magellan Update In article A , Jurriaan Wittenberg writes In APR Ron Baalke writes On Monday morning, April , the moon will occult Venus and interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about minutes Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on The gravity data is collected in real time and it not recorded to the tape recorder However, you only need to collect the gravity every rd or th orbit, so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for a short while BTW When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan Not that I am looking forward to that day but I am just curious I believe it had something to do with the funding from the goverment or rather NO funding The aerobraking starts May and is expected last about days If the funding is provided million dollars to extend the mission for the high resolution gravity data, then the mission will last through October Otherwise, the mission will end this coming July Ron Baalke Jet Propulsion Lab M S Telos The aweto from New Zealand Pasadena, CA is part caterpillar and part vegetable
