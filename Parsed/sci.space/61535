From Henry Spencer Subject Re Combo Propulsion System In article writes How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on the way out to the outer planets but once in near to orbit to use more normal If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration sure you can use chemical rockets for that but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major We're talking seriously high cruising velocities taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit isn't easy with chemical Incidentally solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration system for something like They don't go anywhere I speak as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project although that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun resembles a high speed collision Henry Spencer U of Toronto Zoology between and Dick Dunn utzoo henry
