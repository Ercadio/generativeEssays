From Ethan Bradford Subject Re Gamma Ray WHere are In article writes I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the event and the r So if the r law is incorrect assume some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us The even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays being shorter then the thickness of the disk of the I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma ray sources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to be significantly
