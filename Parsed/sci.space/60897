wasted on the moon. it's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000r?) bills
to fuel their moon-dozers. the money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged. it's a way of funding
high-tech research, just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country, or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to
fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-european
cooperation. now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of
money (in fact, i'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as
investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at
the size of that multiplier :->). nick haines
