From Subject Re Vandalizing the Newsgroups Subject Re Vandalizing the excerpts from posting on this topic In article Enzo Liguori writes Now Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile long inflatable billboard in low earth the real purpose of the project is to help the environment The platform will carry ozone monitors I can't believe that a mile long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky Venus is visible during the day but nobody complains about Besides it's in LEO so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright and even if it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time as it goes zipping across the I've seen satellites at midnight they're not only in o From the book Prodigal Genius The Life of Nikola Tesla by John O'Neill This remarkable conductivity of gases including the air at low pressures led Tesla to suggest in a published statement in a system of lighting on a terrestrial scale in which he proposed to treat the whole Earth with its surrounding atmosphere as if it were a single The whole Earth would be transformed into a giant lamp with the night sky completely making the night as bright as Now my comments I'd like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional Some of what I would complain about is rooted in Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine sacred unsullied by the actions of The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time none of which had any connection with the petty matters of Any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief in an The Space Age changed all The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo on this view could only happen To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin Yes I know aircraft are almost always in I have to live in a very populated area miles from an international airport currently where light pollution on the ground is The impact of humans is so extreme here virtually no place exists that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels or rats I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend getting away from it all paved roads indoor plumbing malls and it felt good for a while then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles miles to the Their 'security light' didn't help matters much But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air So I know the skies are rarely But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some I mean they've been TRYING this forever like concerning Tesla's idea to banish night wow I don't watch commercial television but I can imagine just how disgusting beer truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so If ya' gotta make a buck on it displaying products in heaven at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern To be open about this though I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend tonight Friday at EDT it will reach an altitude of degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore I'll be trying to see it if I can it is my mealticket after So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by Be that as it may I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid even if it can't ever be perfectly Regards Hathaway Baltimore MD
