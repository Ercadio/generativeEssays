From Subject Blow up space station easy way to do This might a real wierd idea or maybe I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard Why not do the same thing for a space Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons spin then around I know a problem in micro gravity let them dry cure harden and cut a hole for the docking attaching ring and bingo a space Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering heat shield and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint covering of the inner wall would have to be human Maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and Sorry for any spelling errors I missed school grin Why musta space station be so difficult why must we have girders why be confined to earth based ideas lets think new ideas after all space is not earth why be limited by earth based ideas Michael Adams I'm not high just jacked going crazy in Nome Alaska break up is
