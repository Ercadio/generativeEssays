Subject Re Comet in Temporary Orbit Around Jupiter From Robert Coe bob COM writes Also, perihelions of Gehrels were April jupiter radii August jupiter radii Where Jupiter radius , km , mi AU So the figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove Is that the case for the figure as well Sorry, perijoves I'm not used to talking this language Hmmmm The prefix peri is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited That's why it's perihelion rather than perisol , perigee rather than periterr , and pericynthion rather than perilune So for Jupiter I'd expect it to be something like perizeon Bob bob COM Robert K Coe Churchill St, Sudbury, Massachusetts
