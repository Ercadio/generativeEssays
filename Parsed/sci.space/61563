From David Ward Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for Days In article David Palmer You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost and you don't want to clip off the panels each The artist renderings that I've seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended with a cradle holding HST at a degree angle to the I think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved so I'm not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or However it doesn't appear that an array retraction was necessary for For the Gamma Ray Observatory one of the design requirements was that there be no stored energy mecahnisms springs explosive squibs gas shocks used for This was partially so that everything could be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay and partially for safety I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they Thanks for the input on GRO's S A design That would explain the similar design on Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to orbit of per pound everybody designed things for easy Heck the MMS project used to design missions with servicing in The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on orbit replacement for the instrument module on That way you get two instruments for the price of one spacecraft bus the Explorer Platform A second on orbit replacement was also considered with the FUSE David Palmer David GSFC
