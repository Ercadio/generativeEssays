From Gary Coffman Subject Re Philosophy How Boldly In article David Palmer writes Gary Coffman writes Lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing That means that much more energy would be required for the creature to The bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral That's why you don't find large active boneless creatures on Hydraulics can make rigid No energy required just for Hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a This is one of those yes but It's true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it's straight on compressive strength is high and it's torsional resistance increase is practically On the other grasping member there's no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in Tree roots are an Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure It's interesting to note that on land creatures are either two legged or legged with tiny insects having or legs but never legged though that would be a stable It can be argued that legged creatures Kangaroos are The specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some The panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs especially fully functional Kangaroos limbed I don't think If you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are I think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than I don't know much about panda thumbs so I'll ask is it opposable Thermodynamic considerations of surface volume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range similar to what we see about inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely as do those much larger than the Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent Yes I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far space aliens are also Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent but I'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don't think it's First let me say that when I say intelligent I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way it will do That's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the There's room for a large brain though no indication that one ever One reason this may be true is neuronic The electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large So there's little selection pressure for such Instead a simpler distributed network This doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that Then there are the thermodynamic A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume I contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise That argument may be somewhat The dinosaur's problem is the reverse it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm But for a creature the size of a brontosaur it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste Whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is IE monkey I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much Gary Gary Coffman You make it gatech gary Destructive Testing Systems we break uunet rsiatl gary Shannon Way Guaranteed emory gary Lawrenceville GA
