From Steinn Sigurdsson Subject Re Gamma Ray WHere are In article Ethan Bradford writes In article Steinn Sigurdsson writes The problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been It would have to involve new physics as far as I can Closest to conventional Oort sources is a model of B field pinching by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at least it was a good So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis which had a lot of problems We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of Hmm the superbowl burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis from what I've read and I haven't seen the papers only the press I'd say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract To get a copy of this Here is the abstract of that indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list although there is no known mechanism for generating GRBs from cometary Unlikely as it may seem the possibility that GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is This does not propose a mechanism for GRBs in the Oort and no anti matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation Big That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known in particular comet aphelia which are not well known are not a good measure of the Oort cloud Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory standard disclaimer The laws of gravity are very very strict And you're just bending them for your own benefit
