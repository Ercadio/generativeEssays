From Matt Riddle Subject Sony DAT Retrospect Ci Problems Hi, I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work I'm using Retrospect Ci, and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci, which has now unfortunately gone to another department Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra setup I can't seem to get the Retrospect software to recognize the media at all When in the Devices dialog, it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly 'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown' This does not happen with the Mac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready' I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some solution I know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra, but they have a Mac IIci which they can use THE SYMPTOMS System software is , also didn't work with I have tried the following Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI required Tested on a variety of machines Quadra, IIsi, and LC at least Connected no other SCSI devices Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc Replaced the DAT unit with a new one Yes we got that desperate Read the Retrospect manual EVEN MORE DESPERATE Replies via email would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance I'll post any solutions to this group Cheers, Matt Matthew Riddle Science Multimedia Teaching Unit Tel Faculty of Science Fax University of Melbourne AUSTRALIA My opinions are my own
