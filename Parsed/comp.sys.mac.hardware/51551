From David Joshua Mirsky Subject Re Desktop rebuild and Datadesk keyboard In article C I w oE cs uiuc edu Terry Thiel writes Ijust got a new Datadesk E keyboard to go with my new Centris and have a problem doing desktop rebuilds I hold down the Command and Option keys and restart but nothing happens The DIP switches are set the right way and the Command and Option keys seem to work on anything else I'm running btw Anyone know what the problem is Terry I am resending this message because my news program may have goofed the first time Terry, I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk E I don't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable and it worked with the other keyboard The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise I checked the dipswitches and they are fine Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works I am annoyed with Datadesk I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection repair replacement The technician on the phone said they have a day turn around time meaning you should receive the inspected repaired keyboard in that time Well, they have had the keyboard for over weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it It's annoying because it cost me to send them the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free tell me if you have a similar experience with them David Mirsky
