from marc matteo subject why the drive speeds differ hi all, i just got a la cie meg external hard drive. speed tests show that it's
substantially faster that my internal 105 meg quantum hd. supposedly the 105
and the 240 (both lps drives) are roughly rated the same speed. why such a large difference? marc.
