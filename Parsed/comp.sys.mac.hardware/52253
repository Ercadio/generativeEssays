From David Joshua Mirsky Subject Re Datadesk keyboard Centris Hi Its me I couldn't agree with you I finally received my Datadesk keyboard a month after sendng it to Datadesk to have it They didn't tell me over the phone that you had to wait before pressing the shift key to disable Actually they did but not until a day before my keyboard But a month earlier they were of no help at I really think they need to put a disclaimer on their keyboard David
