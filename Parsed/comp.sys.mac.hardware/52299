From Ted Schreiber Subject Flaky Large Memory SIMMS on 's In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 's has a Mb Simm and the other a Mb simm Both are about months old, bought from different vendors and installed by different people Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the Memory Chimes Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer In both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback, my marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution If somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving I've had no problem for the past weeks by replacing my Mb simm with a Mbsimm although this is NOT desireble solution Please email any resp and or post if usefull to the rest of the world Ted Ted Schreiber Mechanical Enginering Northwestern University Tel FAX Email
