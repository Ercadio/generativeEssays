From Subject Re cd question In article h sav dsyibm desy de Michael M Savitski writes Hi, there I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD I've been told, however, that The double speed of CD is achievable only on machines with SCSI Wrong, the CD external is just a plain ol' SCSI device The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession capability, which I need No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing Its just that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability Multisession means that when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can read and display them Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data excluding sound at around double the speed Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD CD is not multisession capable This means that you lose the ability to add any more pictures after the first time must buy a new CD Finally, since the CD is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer data excluding sound Michael M Savitski Tel DESY Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Fax Notkestr , D Hamburg , Germany Internet DECNET VXDESY SAVITSKI
