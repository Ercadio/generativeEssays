From Subject Re question In article Michael Savitski writes Hi there I have a MAC LC and consider buying I've been told however that The double speed of is achievable only on machines with SCSI Wrong the external is just a plain ol' SCSI The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession capability which I No multisession capability and double speed are two different Its just that the newer CD ROM drives have both Multisession means that when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session the drive can read and display Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data excluding sound at around double the Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with say is not multisession This means that you lose the ability to add any more pictures after the first time must buy a new CD Finally since the is not a double speed drive it will require twice as long to transfer data excluding sound Michael Savitski Tel DESY Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Fax Hamburg Germany Internet DECNET VXDESY SAVITSKI
