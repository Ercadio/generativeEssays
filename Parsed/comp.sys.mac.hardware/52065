From Brian V Hughes Subject Re Monitors should they be kept on hours a day Jim Smyton writes Paul Nevai writes Yes, I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldn't I keep them on hours a day Any advice Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your electric bill when you are looking at your computer set up, especially if you have a large or greater color monitor Generally what I do is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my office I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being displyed on the monitor's tube Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day Really What makes you think this The Q file server in my office has been on for the last months, straight, and it hasn't had any problems Note I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off when I'm not actually working on the server itself Hades
