From Rainer Menes Subject Re Quadra clock chip followup I have replaced the osz to MHz yesterday and no truble at My Quadra now works at MHz stable for more than I have also tried a MHz osz but after hour my Quadra I am not sure what was the reason for that but it is to risky to run it to Most of your Quadras should work at MHz without any But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to During my MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working So once again do a backup befor you start Now the speedometer results after replacing the Speedometer Report for menes Prepared April Machine Record Version User Comment Quadra and Ram Disk MByte RAM MByte VRAM System Information Computer Mac Quadra CPU FPU Integral FPU MMU Integral MMU Color Quickdraw Bit QD System Version Finder Version AppleTalk Version LaserWriter Version Laser Prep Version Not Found ImageWriter Version ROM Version ROM Size Bit Depth Horizontal DPI Vertical DPI Primary Screen Size x Physical RAM Logical RAM Results Uses Mac Classic as CPU Graphics Disk Name of Hard Disk tested RAM Disk Math Performance Rating PR Benchmark Results Uses Mac Classic as KWhetstones Dhrystones Towers QuickSort Bubble Sort Queens Puzzle Permutations Fast Fourier Matrix Multiply Integer Matrix Multiply Sieve Benchmark Average FPU Tests Uses Mac II as FFPU Fast Fourier FPU KWhetstones FPU Matrix FPU Test Average Color Tests Uses Mac II as Black White Colors Colors Colors Color Test Average Very interesting are the graphics results Graphics couldn't belief this but it is Two points which my cause problems are the MByte Ram solder on the The are only Rams and run at the upperlimit with The next part which may cause trouble are the Video I have the orignal VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat I would say After running my Quadra for more than hours the heat sink is really A MHz with heat sink is mutch warmer than the in the Quadra so I didn't see any The room temperatur was Celsius F If you living in a area were it is hot F C and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe Hope you will have the same success than I had Rainer email
