From Rainer Menes Subject Re Quadra clock chip followup I have replaced the osz to MHz yesterday and no truble at all My Quadra now works at MHz stable for more than hours I have also tried a MHz osz, but after hour my Quadra died I am not sure what was the reason for that, but it is to risky to run it to fast Most of your Quadras should work at MHz without any problems But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade During my MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again So once again do a backup befor you start Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz Speedometer Report for menes rainer Prepared April , Machine Record Version User Comment Quadra Mhz and Ram Disk MByte RAM MByte VRAM System Information Computer Mac Quadra CPU MC FPU Integral FPU MMU Integral MMU Color Quickdraw Bit QD System Version Finder Version D AppleTalk Version LaserWriter Version D Laser Prep Version Not Found ImageWriter Version D ROM Version C ROM Size Bit Depth Horizontal DPI Vertical DPI Primary Screen Size x Physical RAM K Logical RAM K P R Results Uses Mac Classic as CPU Graphics Disk Name of Hard Disk tested RAM Disk Math Performance Rating PR Benchmark Results Uses Mac Classic as KWhetstones Dhrystones Towers QuickSort Bubble Sort Queens Puzzle Permutations Fast Fourier F P Matrix Multiply Integer Matrix Multiply Sieve Benchmark Average FPU Tests Uses Mac II as FFPU Fast Fourier FPU KWhetstones FPU F P Matrix Mult FPU Test Average Color Tests Uses Mac II as Black White Colors Colors Colors Color Test Average Very interesting are the graphics results Graphics couldn't belief this, but it is true Two points which my cause problems are the MByte Ram solder on the board The are only ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with MHz The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams I have the orignal ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink I would say NO After running my Quadra for more than hours the heat sink is really cool A MHz with heat sink is mutch warmer than the in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems The room temperatur was Celsius F If you living in a area were it is hot F C and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side Hope you will have the same success than I had, Rainer email
