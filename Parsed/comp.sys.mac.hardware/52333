From Peter Bell Subject Re LCIII or used IIci which should I get In article C no J Char Aznabul writes In article A Erik Adams writes I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci Prices The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and greater memory capacity Depends on the price you can get the ci for Educationally speaking, the LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under Add in roughly for a monitor Last I'd heard, an mb LCIII simm went for I think you're in a win win situation No matter what you decide, you'll most likely be happy with it James Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the M harddrive configuration When I got my lowly classic II, the options were or M harddrives, and it was clear that buying another M of harddrive space would cost much more than the difference in price between the two config uartions There is an analogous break in the LCIII and prices, and you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a several MB up to partition, or if you are generating large files with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix like os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful when you are pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much it would cost you to add more storage down the road Might be a useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over M, though I must admit that I am such a packrat that within months of getting my computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, softPC or trying any unix os Peter
