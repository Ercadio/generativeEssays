From Ray Fischer Subject Re patrickd Lazer writes I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E mail me the following if you only know one that's fine Specs for the how it compares to the Pentium Specs for the can fill a page Some highlights bit address space w bit data bit integer registers bit floating point copyback capable caches way set Typical clocks integer clocks for a floating point interesting aside the can multiply two bit floating point numbers in less time than it can multiply two bit integers Specs for the with estimated cost release date More of the same but with multiple instruction Figure about clocks per instruction typical my guess But the Motorola guys are pretty bright it may be I'm interested in speeds systems it can run Windows NT RISC or whatever costs bus info register All the technical Call I'm not typing it all I am hoping that the can win yet another battle against the intel I'm predicting that both the and lines are reaching their New experimental processors have bit data pathways and can schedule up to out of instructions each clock That sort of trick can't really be done with CISC I finally saw some details on the Pentium and was not greatly They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to speed but otherwise it's only going to be a And to get that they're using two integer units larger caches and a branch target Yes I know they're talking about Big Designing a board is difficult and really Priced memory chips lately Ray Fischer Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than Friedrich Nietzsche
