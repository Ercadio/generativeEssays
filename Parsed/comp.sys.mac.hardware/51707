From Ray Fischer Subject Re Specs patrickd wpi WPI EDU Lazer writes I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E mail me the following if you only know one, that's fine Specs for the esp how it compares to the Pentium Specs for the can fill a page book Some highlights are bit address space w bit data width bit integer registers bit floating point registers K copyback capable caches, way set associative Typical clocks integer instruction clocks for a floating point multiply interesting aside the can multiply two bit floating point numbers in less time than it can multiply two bit integers Specs for the with estimated cost, release date, etc More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching Figure about clocks per instruction typical my guess But the Motorola guys are pretty bright, it may be less I'm interested in speeds, systems it can run Windows NT, RISC, or whatever , costs, bus info, register info All the technical info Call Motorola I'm not typing it all in I am hoping that the can win yet another battle against the intel people I'm predicting that both the x and x lines are reaching their ends New experimental processors have bit data pathways and can schedule up to out of instructions each clock cycle That sort of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures I finally saw some details on the Pentium and was not greatly impressed They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a x speedup And to get that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch target buffer Yes, I know they're talking about MHz processors Big whoop Designing a MHz board is difficult and really expensive Priced ns memory chips lately Ray Fischer Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies Friedrich Nietzsche
