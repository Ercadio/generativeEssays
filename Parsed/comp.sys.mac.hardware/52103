From Guy Kuo Subject Quadra clock chip followup My recently modified Quadra with a socket for clock oscillators has now completed nearly hours of error free operation at mhz with a mhz clock oscillator I have also tried a mhz CMOS clock and that works as well On the more stupid side, I've discovered you can use a mhz clock and make your Q as slow as a Centris However, a mhz clock which would have yielded a mhz Quadra Who'd want one didn't work at all Impatiently awaiting a mhz clock, Guy Kuo
