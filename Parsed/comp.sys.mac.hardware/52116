From Steven Adams Subject NEC FGe vs NEC FG We were told that the resolution on the FGe could only go to x And that the FG could go to x Has anybody tried running these higher resolutions Somewhere I thought I read that the x on a monitor may make the type too small to read Any help would be appreciated Steve
