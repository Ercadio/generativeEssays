From Who Me Subject Re Good Hard Disk driver for non Apple drives Sys compat In article JARTSU A , Jartsu wrote Hi there What is your recommendation for a good hard disk driver software for non Apple drives I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media drive, but maybe for some normal drives too FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition HDT Hard Drive Toolkit , which is what I own This is less fancy than the full version, but good enough for what you and I want to do Casa Blanca offers Drive , but I'm not that familiar with it I think that both Drive and HDT PE can be had for around US I've used Silverlinging at work v , and I like HDT PE much better IMHO it has a better interface, and easier to understand Any Drive users James
