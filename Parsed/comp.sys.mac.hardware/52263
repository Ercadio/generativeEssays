From Davidson Subject StyleWriter II Dying I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago and lately when I print something I notice white lines or gaps running through the line being It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when advancing I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem but the lines are still Has anyone else noticed this problem What's the best way to get rid of it Brian Davidson Internet Rochester Institute of Technology BITNET RITVAX
