From Tom Dickens Subject Re iisi clock upgrades I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower stock speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any I don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if I can switch without any lock up problems then I could switch to when needed and put it back to idle MHz when not This would further reduce the wear and tear on the CPU even with a heat Of course I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother I haven't started probing around inside my si Does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators Tom Dickens Boeing Computer Services These statements are mine and not Boeing's
