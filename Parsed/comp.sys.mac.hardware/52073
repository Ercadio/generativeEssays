From Subject PB and Extended Keyboard Hello I saw this question posted a week or so ago but as far as I could tell no answer appeared on the What is the good oil on connecting the Apple Extended Keyboard to a PowerBook The earlier questioner wonderd if this would be too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I am I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an external But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it Any help gratefully I will summarise to the net if Thanks John I am thinking of a but I assume that this would apply to all PB'
