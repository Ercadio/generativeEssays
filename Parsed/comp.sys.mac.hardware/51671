From Jartsu Subject HELP WANTED Monitor problems NEC IIvi Hello all For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync predecessor of to work properly with the internal video of Mac With a VGA adapter as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video it works only some minor interferences occur small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible But because the scanrates stuff of are well enough for emulating Apple RGB I first made an adapter then got one fron the local distributor of With both adapters I can get a picure which looks excellent most of the time or every now and But with radical changes on screen opening palettes large windows there are major interferences in The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up Even when it is clear there are some spiky interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull downs With the self made adapter almost identical to the VGA one only sense pins differ it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from With the adapter from NEC everything is well most of the time but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely But not nearly as often as with the self made I know with self made adapters there can always be interference but with the one provided by where's the source of this interference I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess and I hope that you can at least someone please try figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged especially syncs and Yes I have checked that the monitor is not defective it works perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to pixels and also Atari monochrome which I am using now with Here are the pinouts stuff pin mini D sub NEC pin D sub Mac at least Quadra Red Video Red GND Green Video Red Video Blue Video Composite Sync GND Sense GND Green Video Red GND Green GND Green GND Sense Blue GND NC NC Blue Video GND Sense GND GND NC Blue GND GND NC SHELL GND SHELL GND Connection suggested by Apple for VGA SVGA sense pins changed to emulate Apple with Multisync my self made adapter Multisync mini D sub Mac D sub grounded to sync GND Connection measured from an adapter to make NEC emulate Apple adapter provided by NEC representative NEC mini Mac SHELL GND same as above Not Connected Well I am waiting for your And thanks Jartsu
