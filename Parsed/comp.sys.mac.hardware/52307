From SAURABH MISRA Subject Re LCIII or used IIci which should I get According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa is not the same as an LCIII It only has a Mhz while the LCIII has a Mhz Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge about Macs as I do about DOS machines Saurabh
