From David Sachs Subject Re What's that chime In article A , willie chang writes It happened to my classic ii once At startup, after the usual powerup tone, there were chimes kinda like do st mi st sol st do nd or st C st E st G nd C on the music scale , and it hanged before giving the happy mac I had to re powerup This was asked before but I can't remember the answer I've tried to find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail Can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean A spurious memory check error Thanks willie Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose Next time you power down the computer, check that all cables are on tight
