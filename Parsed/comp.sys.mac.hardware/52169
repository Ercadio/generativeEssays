From Povl H Pedersen Subject Re SE bit card does not work with mb In r kve Ossip Kaehr writes I have a SE and a Generation Systems bit PDS card for a screen It worked great until I upgraded from to mb ram Now with Sys and MODE or enabler it does not boot a tech support person said the card does not support these bit fixes I guess he is right Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either, but they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free ROM upgrade from RasterOps BUT when pressing the shift key while booting when the ext monitor goes black after having been grey the system SOMETIMES boots properly and then works ok with the mb and full graphics WHAT's HAPPENING Very easy If you boot without the MODE control panel, then it will disable or rather not reinstall the bit clean patches So when you run OK you must be in bit adressing mode Check About this Macintosh and see if you havce a MB system Thanks a lot for any advice please answer by mail sent seperately Ossip Kaehr voice Ossip Kaehr Hermannstrasse D Berlin Germany Tel or EMail Povl H Pedersen Macintosh specialist Knows some DOS and UNIX too Finger me at for PGP Public Key
