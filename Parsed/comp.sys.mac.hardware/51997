From Andrew Geweke Subject LC II Slowdowns I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three LC IIs, a Mac Plus with MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX My problem The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace These LC IIs have MB RAM, K VRAM, and a Quantum LP S HD installed I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit , and it gives a very respectable overall rating to this drive, so it's not the drive I have reinstalled System , MS Word a, MS Works , and so on, all from the master disks In short, I have done everything I can think of in software I am not a hardware hacker, though I pop cases fairly often But nothing works The problem is intermittent and unpredictable The mouse always moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, for about hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on a MHz , not a MHz It is VERY frustrating and makes it nearly unusable It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity Has anyone encountered this problem before Has anyone got any ideas They would be much appreciated Andrew Geweke Andrew Geweke The Firing Squad BBS, public access Usenet mail and news Saint Paul, Minnesota
