From Mats Bredell Subject Re Rumours about New Duos Brian Hughes wrote Mats Bredell writes In the official paper I got from Apple about the new docking station Apple themselves called it the DuoDock Plus What paper is that It's been on the price list here at Dartmouth since they released it and it has never been called the DuoDock It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products the new docking station was only one of them and the paper arrived before it showed up on the price I don't know if it's still called the DuoDock Plus in the price list it could be a mistake by someone at Apple Mats Mats Bredell Uppsala University Computing Center UDAC Ph Department of medical systems Fax Sweden Think straight be gay
