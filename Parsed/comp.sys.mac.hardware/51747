From Ravikuma Venkateswar Subject Re How do they compare Ray Fischer writes Dave Kitabjian writes I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck and neck for crunch power but for a given clock speed how do we rank the following from to How about some numbers here Some kind of benchmark If you want let me start it While you're at it where will the following fit into the list Pentium PowerPC fastest then Pentium with the first versions of the PowerPC somewhere in the Numbers Pentium PowerPC Note this is the Alpha just for comparison And about clock speed Does doubling the clock speed double the overall processor speed And fill in the 's below MHz MHz Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor clock Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I O As processor clock rates go up the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system If you have a processor it can be reading another word from memory every Sure you can put all memory in your computer but it will cost times as much as the slower Not in a clock doubled There isn't a doubling in performance but it is quite Maybe about a increase in Besides for wait state performance you'd need a cache I mean who uses a processor that runs at the speed of SIMMs Note that this memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of And roughly the is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the Numbers Ray Fischer Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than Friedrich Nietzsche Ravikumar Venkateswar A pun is a no' blessed form of
