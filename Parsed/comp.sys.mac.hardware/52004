questions about system The third part is posted every two weeks in Tables of contents for those two pieces are included Please familiarize yourself with all three sections of this document before All pieces are available for anonymous ftp from in the directory pub usenet Except for this introductory FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as general the name of each file has the format of the last part of the group name followed by the FAQ for is stored as system and the FAQ for is stored as misc RTFM stores files as compressed BINARY If you leave off the at the end of the file name when getting the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to You can also have these files mailed to you by sending an E mail message to with the line send pub usenet macintosh name in the body text where name is the name of the file you want as specified above general faq You can also send this server a message with the subject help for more detailed I HAVE A Congratulations You've come to the right Usenet is a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions How do I lock a floppy disk to queries that would make Steve Jobs himself run screaming from the room in I used ResEdit to remove resources Init WDEF and nVIR from my system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string as a patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box would be a nice shade of Everything worked fine until I installed SuperCDevBlaster and now when I use the Aldus driver to print from PageMaker to a Linotronic my system I'm running System on a PowerBook Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other relevant on line resources listed below in question especially the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups and RTFM Read the Friendly Manual before posting your We realize that you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen of your newly installed twenty megs of RAM but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before and it's developing tired Finally before posting to any newsgroup Macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT WHERE CAN I GET IT is currently divided into multiple pieces a general introduction which you're reading now and specific lists for the newsgroups and FAQ lists for and are in When ready each part will be available in its respective All pieces are available via anonymous ftp from in the pub usenet macintosh Except for this document itself which is named general the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by faq system misc The means the file is stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either MacCompress StuffIt Deluxe or the UNIX uncompress command to decompress However if you leave off the extension when you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at It's not always obvious especially to newcomers where a particular question or comment should be Please familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of Which questions appear in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong To jump to a particular question search for section number enclosed in For example to find Where can I FTP Macintosh software search for the string To jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup and Four other files are worthy of particular note Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup It's posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from in pub Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for available in that newsgroup and from in mac faq where the file you're reading now is also irregularly archived This list answers many frequently asked questions about networking UNIX and the Mac telecommunications and foreign file Norm Walsh has compiled an excellent FAQ for that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross platform conversion and It's available in or by ftp from in pub norm FAQ Finally Jim Jagielski maintains a FAQ for covering Apple's UNIX environment A It's posted every to weeks in and It's available for anonymous ftp at WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO There are no stupid questions but there are misplaced You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one would you So don't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft Word is in the Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an If you want people to help you you need to learn their ways of Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering For instance the most common and glaring mispost one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic asking a question about networking anywhere except normally produces no useful Posting the same question to ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software Please post to exactly ONE Do not cross If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs it's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time For the same reason should not be used as a catch all The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs Specifically questions about productivity applications software you bought your Macintosh to run not software you bought to make your Macintosh run better should go to unless the application is covered in a more specific Communications programs games HyperCard compilers and databases all have more topical Post questions about non communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to Questions about MacOS system software belong in Questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in Questions about A UX go to Detailed questions about Appletalk belong in Direct questions about HyperCard to Non HyperCard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to ResEdit questions may be posted either to or but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of are considerably more practiced at the art of resource A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's Recent example How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages might be better addressed to the programmer For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to and We understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded Mac to get the for a PowerBook but trust me anyone who wants to buy it will be reading Political and religious questions The Mac is better than Windows Is not Is too Is not Is too Hey How 'bout the Amiga What about it Is Not Is too belong in Anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the newsgroups the appropriate forums for your Many questions about modems in are much more thoroughly discussed in Questions about Mac MIDI are often better handled in even though it's not a Macintosh specific Shop Usenet's a big place and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR TWENTY MEGABYTES OF SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent Unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in System could eat memory private E mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future I do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that lets me send PWFAQ's people with frequently asked questions the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get FTP WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE The three major North American Internet archives of shareware freeware and demo software are sumex and which mirrors the other two sites and several Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site Rascal was notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the less efficient BinHex format common at the other Unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above To keep traffic on the Internet manageable Scandinavians should try connecting to or Those in the should look first at Continental Europeans can try and Australian users should try to find what they want at which mirrors info mac and Japanese users will find sumex mirrored at A fourth very important site is This is Apple's semi official repository for system software developer tools source code technical notes and other things that come more or less straight from Apple's Some material at this site may not be distributed outside the or by other sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple system Please read the various README documents available at for the detailed info if you're connecting from outside the or if you wish to redistribute material you find CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E MAIL The info mac archives at sumex aim are available by E mail from LISTSERV alternately The listserver responds to the commands MACARCH HELP MACARCH INDEX and MACARCH GET Mac archive files are available from Send it a message containing the words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may You can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at For details send it a message with just the text help no quotes WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an E mail message addressed to archie with the subject Archie servers are located at America the original archie server in Canada Australia Scandinavia and the and the continent These sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous Login as archie no password is needed and type prog filename to find what you're looking for or type help for more detailed For instance you would type prog Disinfectant to search for a convenient ftp site for If the initial search fails to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of the For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with prog Disinfectant you might try prog disi Substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of To avoid many erroneous matches add a to the end of the substring prog Most Mac software available on the net ends in but almost no UNIX or PC software Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE asking where you can find a particular piece of If you follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from that was corrupt or missed at your Please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous FTP archie and automatic E mail WHAT IS Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer First they're compressed to make them faster to download and then they're translated to either a binhex or MacBinary format that other computers can The Macintosh uses a special two fork filing system that chokes most other BinHex files are bit ASCII text files while MacBinary files are pure bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary How a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its Normally a file will have a name something like indicates how it was compressed and indicates how it was To use a file you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the Most files you get from the net require a two step decoding First change the binhex or MacBinary file to a double clickable Macintosh file then decompress Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh files as they are Suffix Extractors StuffIt X X X X X Compact Pro X X Packit X UUTool X MacCompress X SunTar X X X X BinHex X BinHex X DiskDoubler X X UnZip X DiskCopy X macutil X X X X A few notes on the decompressors StuffIt is a family of products that use several different compression The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff all of Versions of StuffIt earlier than StuffIt StuffIt Classic UnStuffIt and StuffIt Deluxe and will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt StuffIt Lite and Deluxe consistently makes smaller archives than any other Macintosh compression To allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net bandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with StuffIt UUTool MacCompress and SunTar handle the popular UNIX formats of uuencode compress and tar The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac products so use them instead when that's an Translators that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a Since UNIX stores files differently than does the Mac macutil creates MacBinary files which should be automatically converted on It can't decompress In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt However if you need only one or two files out of an archive for instance if you want to read the README to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it macutil is It can be found at sumex aim in the info mac unix A few notes on the compression formats These are MacBinary Always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them never ASCII or Most files on the net are stored as Only rascal stores most of its files in Most communications programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they'll be downloading MacBinary This format is normally used only for system software so that on line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer Instead of using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies you can use Steve Christensen's freeware utility MountImage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy MountImage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in files don't merit a position in the above table because they're self They may have been created with Compact Pro StuffIt or even DiskDoubler but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double For some unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self extracting archives created with their payware products SuperDisk and More Disk Instead they append either or to self extracting HOW CAN I GET BINHEX STUFFIT By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for If you're at a university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo Sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of Once you have StuffIt any version you don't need If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy of StuffIt from a local bulletin board If you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp then I suppose I'll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by far the hardest way to get Ftp to and Type the word Hit Type cd mirrors compression and hit Then get StuffIt Expander SEA bin and hit Of course it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something If you've ftp'd straight onto your Mac you should now have a self extracting archive which will produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double If you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first you still need to use a modem program to download it to your Just make sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary If you need more details on the last step consult the FAQ list for and the manuals for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications HOW CAN I GET BINHEX STUFFIT FROM A PC You can' There is absolutely NO way to get an executable Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous You MUST beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another I realize this may terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement since you got an Apple II in but eventually you're going to need to link up with some human being other than your though I suppose if you're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for While you're gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight please don't bother the net by asking this question There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh programs from a PC or other non Macintosh computer onto a Mac without software that is not bundled with most TROUBLESHOOTING WHAT TO DO BEFORE POSTING WHEN THINGS GO WRONG While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific problems there are far more problems that aren't covered These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for You should probably also perform the ten step preventative maintenance routine described in section four especially rebuilding the desktop and resizing the system heap Following these steps may or may not solve your problem but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to IDENTIFY THE Microsoft Word is crashing doesn't say What were you doing when it crashed Can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash The more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions preceding it Step the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the For example Sometimes QuarkXPress crashes with a coprocessor not installed is not nearly as helpful as QuarkXPress crashes when I link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain The former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given The latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it's still there or READ THE READ ME Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their READ ME Often these aren't documented in the Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound CHECK FOR Run Disinfectant or another anti viral across your Virus infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT For half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to This can cause all types of unexplained unusual Restoring from original masters will normally fix REINSTALL THE SYSTEM Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as See question for a detailed procedure for performing a clean If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these steps chances are you've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the So it's time to ISOLATE THE You need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert Here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash Run only one application at a Occasionally applications do conflict with each If the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the If you're running System turn off If you're running System allot as much memory to the application as you can Sometimes programs just need more memory especially when performing complicated If you're running System turn off virtual memory and bit There's still an awful lot of System hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no Can you say Microsoft Word boys and girls I knew you Some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are Boot from a virgin system If the problem disappears you likely have an init You need to progressively remove extensions until the problem Use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to If the problem occurs when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang If the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a Once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set Continue until you've narrowed the conflict down to one When you think you've found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the CONTACT TECHNICAL By now you should have a very good idea of when where and why the conflict If a tech support number is available for the software call If you're lucky the company will have a work around or fix If not perhaps they'll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE You wouldn't drive your car miles without giving it a tune A computer is no Regular tune ups avoid a lot of Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to charge you or more for the equivalent of an oil change there's no reason you can't change it The following nine step program should be performed about every three TRASH UNNEEDED FILES Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard If you're at all like me you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have archives of software you've dearchived shareware you tried out and didn't like announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer If you're running System you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can Throw them away and empty the RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your If you don't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up you're probably better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every For instance if you only read PC disks once a month there's no need to keep AccessPC loaded all the Cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid REBUILD THE DESKTOP The Desktop file database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created It lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display Depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop As applications and files move on and off your hard disk the Desktop file can be become bloated and Think of it as a Congress for your Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an One warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you've stored in the Get Info Under System Maurice Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments across a CommentKeeper also works with System but only if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and as your extensions finish loading depress the Command and Option You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that This could take a few Click It will take more than a few The more files you have the longer it will If you're running System you may want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance you may want to use Fifth Generation's freeware init Desktop Desktop Reset completely deletes the Desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly corrupt data ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK All Macs from the original Thin Mac to the Quadra contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot Unfortunately this parameter RAM can become corrupted and cause unexplained To reset it under System hold down the Command Option P and R keys while restarting your Under System hold down the Command Option and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the Apple Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General Control Panel you should now reset them to whatever you The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the date and time but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they All these extensions and most applications too need space in a section of memory called the System If the System Heap isn't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked All this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the If you're using System your Macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary but if you're running System it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and By default this size is set to way too small for most Macs with any extensions at The system heap size is stored in the normally non editable boot blocks of every system Bill Steinberg's freeware utility BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be If you're running System get BootMan use it and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE System files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file I recommend doing a clean Here's how Boot from the installer floppy of your System Copy any non standard fonts and desk accessories out of your System file into a temporary Trash the System file on your hard Also trash the Finder MultiFinder DA Handler and all other standard Apple extensions like Control Panel and These will all be replaced in the new If you're running or installing System move everything in the Extensions Control Panels and Preferences folders into the top level of the System Rename the System Any name other than System Folder is Double click the installer script on your System Then choose Select the appropriate software for your model Mac and You could do an Easy Install instead but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't need that waste your memory and disk Once installation is finished move everything from the temporary folder you created in step into the new System If you're asked if you want to replace anything you forgot to take something out in step You'll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step You should now have a clean defragmented System file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system DISK UTILITIES Much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data Apple includes Disk First Aid a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its System It's also available for anonymous ftp from in the directory dts mac Even if you have an earlier version you should get the latest version from and run it on all your hard Several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything that Disk First Aid The three most effective for general work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe Fifth Generation's Public Utilites and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh A department or work group should have all of these as well as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others For individuals MacTools street is about half the price of Norton street or Public Utilities street so features and ease of use being roughly equal I recommend All of these products occasionally encounter problems they can't When that happens it's time to backup and reformat BACKING UP This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a LOT more often than every three The simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable If you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it's easy to only back up those folders which change Nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard A number of programs are available to make backing up Apple included a very basic full backup application with System With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder onto The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the Mac and MacTools Deluxe include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive network server or removable media device to use for backups you should check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux street doesn't support tape drives and Diskfit Pro street There are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD Backup from System DISK DEFRAGMENTATION As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large Therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard As files become more and more fragmented performance can There are several ways to defragment a hard The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while you're at See question and restore all the A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place without erasing Although the ads for all these products brag about their safety once you've bought the software and opened the shrink wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go There are NO freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the net by asking for REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold You don't need to reformat every three months but when your system is crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate Reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of Not all hard disks are created Some can hold more data than To facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks megabytes is the average formatted Your mileage may Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive When you reformat there's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize Most hard disks come with formatting Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup a minimal disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard Normally this will be all you
