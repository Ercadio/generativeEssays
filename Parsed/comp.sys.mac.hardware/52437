From Jeff Masud Subject Formatting more than Possible A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD Apparently it rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or something that allows it get more space out of a normal HD floppy It supposedly gets upto Megs so something like I don't have the program since I can't use it and its supposed to be called something like or something like My question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not possible is it due to hardware A developer friend of mine said that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field Thanks for any information Steve
