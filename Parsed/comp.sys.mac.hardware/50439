From Lex van Sonderen Subject Re CD ROM multisession In article writes As I said I know a multisession CD ROM is necessary if you do more BUT what if it is just a writable CD ROM drive and do a second session do you need one for that too If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi session capability to read the second Whether it is photos or just data or Here is a simplified way of looking at it The first session has the directory structure burned at some The second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc older systems look only for 'the' directory not taking multiple directories into Lex van Sonderen Philips Interactive Media
