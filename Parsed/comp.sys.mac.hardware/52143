From Alexander Samuel McDiarmid Subject Re SVGA Monitors and Centris the real story What is the real story here Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the Centris internal video Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not come with one Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing such The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than that of their mac mike having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is at least for the you can get an adaptor called Mac VGA Q from James engineering and this will let you display and if the monitor is I think the requires horizontal I use this on my sony gives a slightly wider screen than the hope it helps
