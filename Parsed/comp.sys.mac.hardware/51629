From Jason S MacDonald Subject Re LC Ram Upgrade will be SLOW Andrew Geweke writes I cannot speak for Dale But I am quite sure that the Macintosh uses the full bit or bit data path to its full advantage That is, it is running as fast with two or four pin SIMMs as it would with one pin SIMM Now, it may be that longword accesses assuming a bit data path here get the first byte from the first SIMM, the second byte from the second, and so on This would mean that each longword of memory is actually split among four SIMMs, one for each byte On the other hand, it could be that the SIMMs are interleaved by word or longword not just by byte , or they could be successive in memory, and the memory controller deals with the eight bit data path that each one has I suspect, though, that they are interleaved to some extent so that bits can be read or written at once This would indicate a byte level interleave I am NOT confusing this with the new machines' longword interleave with two pin SIMMs of the same sort, although that seems to be the same sort of idea There, you get an essential bit data path ro excuse me, to RAM instead of just a bit one Yes, the CPU can't handle it, but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something up So, Dale, am I right pin SIMMs are interleaved by bytes, allowing the full data bus Or, as is common with Usenet and me in particular, am I as clueless as everyone else What conclusion can be drawn from this I'm trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the LC III bit datapath would be fastest Any ideas Thanks, Jason MacDonald Jason Scott MacDonald Technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic Cats exist so that we Arthur C Clarke may caress the lion
