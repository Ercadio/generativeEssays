to work for your setup (too bad). i've daisy-chained 4 scsi devices off my
mac without a problem (limit is 7 scsi devices in the daisy-chain). if it
isn't working for you, it's really better to state the problem (unless all
you really intend to do is try to get nasty e-mail, in that case perhaps you
would be better off posting to alt.masochistic type of newsgroup). /`-_ { }/ joel e callan hey, why do you think i have the answer? \ ./ 2909 n. 44th street may you sit on the tack of success |___| milwaukee, wi 53210 and rise to the occasion!
