From Carter Gregory Subject Re PDS Nubus was Re LC III NuBus Capable In article bchase Bret Chase writes In article Sellers writes Bill Higgins Beam Jockey wrote In article Brian Hughes writes Marvin Miller writes My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot The LC family of Macs can only use PDS They are not able to use Ah but why Can some technically hip Macslinger tell us what the difference is between PDS and Nubus Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a Nubus card cage At least Marvin's friend has not been able to locate one and neither have What is the fundamental reason for this I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the Of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there is no problem building an expansion Apple uses the IEEE Nubus standard for their bit backplane I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago Well almost NuBUS anyway comprehensive bus contention between processors is not supported in the current Macintoshes could be wrong However I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself don't ask Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the NuBUS Very interesting possibilities indeed other stuff deleted Hope this helps Bret Chase internet Macintosh bellnet Smile It won't kill you snailnet wpi box institute Worcester MA Greg
