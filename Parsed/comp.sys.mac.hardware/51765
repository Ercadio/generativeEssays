From University Bookstore Subject Re Why does Apple give us a confusing message In article C nGII BG Monthian Buntan writes Hi there, Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C regarding fpu In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C has the message fpu optional I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all C have the fpu built in except the configuration Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list I'm planning to buy the C cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not Why say optional if it's built in Please, anybody help me understand this game Regards, Thian If you get the Centris with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with a RC processor that has built in math coprocessor support My understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the Centris without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non FPU system to become an FPU system And, it is unclear whether the ' processor on the non FPU system a LC can be replaced with a RC supplied by another vendor Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris , which ONLY comes with a non FPU LC processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again, according to Apple's memo Hope that helps Kevin Lohman University Book Store, University of Washington Buyer for the UW Apple Computers for Education Program
