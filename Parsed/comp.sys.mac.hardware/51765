From University Bookstore Subject Re Why does Apple give us a confusing message In article Monthian Buntan writes Hi there Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for regarding fpu In all Mac price lists I've seen every has the message fpu optional I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all have the fpu built in except the Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list I'm planning to buy the cd pretty soon but I'm now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or Why say optional if it's built in Please anybody help me understand this Regards If you get the Centris with CD configuration you are getting a Mac with a processor that has built in math coprocessor My understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the Centris without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non FPU system to become an FPU And it is unclear whether the ' processor on the non FPU system a can be replaced with a supplied by another Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris which ONLY comes with a non FPU processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to Apple's memo Hope that Kevin Lohman University Book Store University of Washington Buyer for the UW Apple Computers for Education Program
