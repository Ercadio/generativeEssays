From Dale A Dale Adams Subject Re Q Video RAM Questions In article A joseph a brownlee writes Could someone post a definitive answer about the VRAM configuration for the Q and presumably the C and C as well There seems to be a lot of confusion about this issue I'd like to know What kind of SIMMs are the VRAM SIMMs i e pin, etc There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs unlike DRAM SIMMs which come in many, many sizes and pinouts , although they do come with differing amounts of VRAM on them The ones you need are KB SIMMs, are organized as K x , and have two K x VRAM chips on them This is the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use How many VRAM SIMM slots are there Two What rules if any must be followed in filling the slots e g in pairs, sizes must match, etc Both SIMM slots must be filled putting a SIMM in only one slot does nothing for you How fast must they be ns for the Q and C , ns for the C Is there any other relevant information There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible with the Quadra and Centris video hardware Make sure that the source you get them from guarantees compatiblity In general, if it works in a Q , it will work in a Q Please don't reply unless you have the correct information Many thanks in advance for helping to eliminate some noise from this group Trust me Dale Adams Apple Computer, Inc
