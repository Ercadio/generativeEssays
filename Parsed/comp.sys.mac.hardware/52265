From Mario M Subject Re The MHz IIsi I have done several of these upgrades about IIsi's, and Quadra , and the best thing to use would be some sort of heat sink compound If possible, you should look for the silicon free stuff There's a comany who makes the stuff called Tech Spray, their address is P O Box , Amarillo, TX You should be wary in using most kinds of tape and definately don't use duct tape that stuff is for ducts When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small space between the heat sink and the CPU Mario Murphy From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG The message contained in this posting does not in any way reflect BMUG's official views
