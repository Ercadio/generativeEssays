From Steve Bollinger Subject Re Stereo sound problem on mac games In article isy Ingemar Ragnemalm writes Enter game The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making The Sound Driver is pretty ok since it's Sound Manager used by the book is useless Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth It's too Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon If you are trying to write a game you shouldn't be using Instead make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on It works You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting Before it gets The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Unfortunately System supports it poorly making programs crash The moral of the story is to developers DON'T CHEAT Well I want my code to work on old systems I don't know about sys but at least on there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang with no error message This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods necessary for performance and play many sounds stopping sounds Callbacks seems not to be Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel QHead I think it was and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify Callbacks are very reliable I found them reliable even under System I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System with the IM V You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels of course you didn't get In general if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you don't work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of You need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it and the sound manager doesn't work for games remember Spectre uses And it works If Spectre can spare the CPU time you can One little disclaimer There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work I'm not sure either way but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work correctly on every other machine using the Sound Steve
