From Sidney W Kitchel Subject Re Rumours about New Duos J E King writes Since we are on the subject of chip power consumption, I heard from a very reliable source that the DEC Alpha chip uses the power that Intel's Pentium chip does, and it still whips the Pentium's butt Makes you wonder why Intel ever made a chip to begin with Wouldn't you like a PowerBook Alpha running about MIPS Cool idea Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt Sorry wrong It would be an extremely hot idea at least with the current Alphas The available Alphas run up to MHz But they produce quite a bit of heat In fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat sinks Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead of a deal with DEC Sid Sidney W Kitchel , Data Parallel Systems, Inc DPSI E Morningside Drive Bloomington, Indiana, USA FAX
