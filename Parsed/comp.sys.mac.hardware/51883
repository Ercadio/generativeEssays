From Charles Cox Subject Calling all Mac gurus Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM I put VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra in the slots closest to the RAM SIMM slots and I got no results I have been told that the built in video should support at least and maybe color on a Macintosh Color However the Monitors control panel still lists colors as the highest Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in Do you have to do something to activate them Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel BTW I am running System with Megs of Charles Cox Computer Engineering Case Western Reserve University
