From Char Aznabul Subject Re LCIII or used IIci which should I get In article A Erik Adams writes I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci Prices The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and greater memory capacity How important is this How many NuBus cards do you have plan to acquire How much memory do you really need I've got a ci, and mb of ram That's plenty I also have a bit graphics card on the NuBus I'm a sucker for pretty pictures I think the LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can not have At least, not out of the box The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs is the IIci bit clean , and would have sound input I also like the pizza box case The ci is bit clean I solved the sound input problem with a MacRecorder But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder Performance wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the LC III being a little slower The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over So, which should I get Depends on the price you can get the ci for Educationally speaking, the LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under Add in roughly for a monitor Last I'd heard, an mb LCIII simm went for I think you're in a win win situation No matter what you decide, you'll most likely be happy with it James
