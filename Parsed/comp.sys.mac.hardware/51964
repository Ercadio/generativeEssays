From Geoff Peters Subject Re Mac Plus is constantly rebooting Tae Shin wrote Basically the Mac Pluses are constantly rebooting themselves as if the reboot button were being Sometimes the Mac is able to fully boot and display the desktop but it is only a matter of time before it reboots At times the frequency is as high as several times a I wonder if your Mac has those little RESET INTERUPT switches They are plastic devices that push on the switches which are inside the Or mabey those switches are bad and need I wish I caught the original post but anyway The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply sometimes referred to as the analog sweep board is on its way Apart from a board swap bikkies to Apple there's not much the average Joe can do to fix You can of course try and re adjust the voltage levels the rail should be as close to as you cn get it but this is more often than not a temporary A copy of Larry Pina's Macntosh Repair Upgrade Secrets is a worthwhile investment for the serious do it yaself Geoff Peters
