From Kris Tina Schroeder Subject AppleOne Scanner and Printing Quality We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our However I am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing a scanned photo on a LaserWriter I have tried scanning at a higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very However the printed version is coming out ugly Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer Or are there tricks involved to get better quality Or should we be getting something like PhotoShop to pretty up the image I will appreciate any Thanks in advance Kris Kris Schroeder AI KBS Lab Michigan State University
