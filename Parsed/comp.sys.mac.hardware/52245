From Terry Thiel Subject Re Centris flaky Jay Scott writes A rep at the dealer actually it's a university order center so they don't have any immediate financial interest told me that they have been having lots of problems with their Centris He didn't go into details but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the He's not recommending the Centris to anybody he says to consider a Centris or a Why he would recommend a IIvx over an LCIII I don't know but that's what he So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky machine or did Apple send the out the door too early Is your working just great or is it buggy too My is working I haven't heard of any Sounds to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking It's pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris on the basis of problems with one Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII doesn't make a lot of sense If this person is so convinced the is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming it's a problem with all of them Terry
