From CHRIS WERA Subject Centris clock adjustment I was reading a review of the Centris in this months MacWorld and the reviewer said that for you could make an adjustment on the clock speed of the chip and change it from mhz to mhz I haven't heard of this before, and I don't think that this is the chip replacement with fpu that I have seen so much talk about Anyone have any ideas
