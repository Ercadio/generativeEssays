From Subject Re SE rom Gosh I wish people would read the postings that they are 'following up' In article Doug Ashley writes writes In article William Wright writes Anyway I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale or could To use the grayscale features I believe you need a Mac equipped with colour I was told this somewhere or other but it's I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images loaded with the proper However the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on The original poster W G Wright posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz bang Laser Printer from Apple a Select I think which can print He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible This is the one major bugbear about doing a party SE upgrade compared to Apple's SE to SE upgrade you will never be able to run Color It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND SEs CAN print some COLOUR this is because Quickdraw the original non colour version has the right hooks for eight Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers there are lots of Mac Pluses Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to and processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw but they wont and parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs Nutek et Just one Caveat I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer that you would be able to do so whatever Mac you were And I am pretty sure that the Select is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer correct me if I'm wrong Phil Ryan Melbourne Australia
