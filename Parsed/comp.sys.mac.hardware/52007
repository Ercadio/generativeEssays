From Jeff Budzinski Subject Apple Monitor Woes I have a month old that seems to have acquired the jitters of late The Apple color monitor that I'm using with an LCIII sort of jiggles to the left and right all the time now I have attempted to relocate the monitor to make sure the problem isn't interference from something else, but the problem seems to remain no matter what I do Has anybody encountered this problem Thanks, Jeff Budzinski
