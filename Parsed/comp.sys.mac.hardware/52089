From Anthony Dunstan Subject LW Select doesn't work out of box Hello Net People, We have a LaserWriter Select standard Mb RAM connected to an LC III The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type fonts or any TrueType fonts in the System The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct but this printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out of the box IMHO, an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event The installer disks for the printer install LW Select driver v , PrintMonitor v and backgrounder v on a System LC III Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer configuration, because we really need some help on this one Thanks, Anthony
