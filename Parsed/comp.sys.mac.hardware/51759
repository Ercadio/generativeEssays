From Eric Choi Subject Re Educational Pricing gray market eu Apple does not authorise sales through Mail As a result mail eu order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey eu eu This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who eu have more machines than they can They come into this state of eu affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a eu better wholsale price from In either case they often obscure eu the serial nunber to protect their As a result the warranty eu is I have ordered several Macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero You have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell Macs with authentic serial numbers There are value added dealers nothing to do with VAT no flame please that are very CDA unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent Apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to Eric Choi Internet
