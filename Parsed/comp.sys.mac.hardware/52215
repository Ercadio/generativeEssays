From Christopher Bruce Kidwell ck andrew cmu edu Subject Re Hardware that Fits mail order I ordered an external floppy drive from them years ago When I placed the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day A week passed and no drive I called them up and they said they were out of stock and my drive should ship in weeks or so Since I needed the drive right away both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead I cancelled my order and haven't dealt with them since Chris Kidwell
