From Fred G Martin Subject Re Adapter for IIsi and a vga monitor In article A Dongseok Choi writes I understand that if I have a correct adapter then I can use a vga monitor with my IIsi Are those adapters working with specific brands Is adapter for NEC or Sony working with other brands I will be using a vga monitor with IIsi for a month soon I don't have any clue what monitor will be Here's the story The IIsi cannot supply a VGA output However Some VGA type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the Mac uses to drive the Apple or inch high resolution color display i e , Apple's own x mode So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you need a an adapter that converts from the Mac DB connector to the VGA style high density DB connector, but tells the Mac to use it's own x mode, not the VGA x mode, and b a VGA monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac x mode over the VGA x mode which as I stated in above, the IIsi cannot produce As far as a above is concerned, contact James Engineering, Inc Fairmount Ave El Cerrito, CA FAX They can probably get you the right adapter Remember you do not want the run of the mill Mac to VGA adapter, because it will try to have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all Instead, you want an adapter that connects between the Mac style and VGA style connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple x mode Sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction As far as b is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of KHz and a vertical retrace rate of Hz These are the spec's of Apple's x mode For comparison, the VGA standard x mode uses a KHz horizontal bandwidth and a Hz vertical retrace rate The monitor will probably need to have auto synch'ing capability, as the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes in the PC compatible world Good luck Fred Martin Fred Martin Ames St Rm E Epistemology and Learning Group, MIT Media Lab Cambridge, MA USA
