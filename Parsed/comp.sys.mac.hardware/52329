From Fred G Martin Subject Re Adapter for IIsi and a vga monitor In article Dongseok Choi writes I understand that if I have a correct adapter then I can use a vga monitor with my Are those adapters working with specific brands Is adapter for NEC or Sony working with other brands I will be using a vga monitor with IIsi for a month I don't have any clue what monitor will Here's the story The IIsi cannot supply a VGA Some VGA type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the Mac uses to drive the Apple or inch high resolution color display Apple's own So if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi you need a an adapter that converts from the Mac DB connector to the VGA style high density DB connector but tells the Mac to use it's own mode not the VGA mode and b a VGA monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac mode over the VGA mode which as I stated in above the IIsi cannot produce As far as a above is concerned contact James Engineering Fairmount El Cerrito CA FAX They can probably get you the right Remember you do not want the run of the mill Mac to VGA adapter because it will try to have your IIsi produce the VGA mode which it cannot the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all Instead you want an adapter that connects between the Mac style and VGA style connectors but tells the Mac to use the Apple Sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this As far as b is concerned make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of KHz and a vertical retrace rate of These are the spec's of Apple's For comparison the VGA standard mode uses a KHz horizontal bandwidth and a vertical retrace The monitor will probably need to have auto synch'ing capability as the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes in the PC compatible Good luck Fred Martin Fred Martin Ames Epistemology and Learning Group MIT Media Lab Cambridge MA USA
