i'd give you the address of alberta computer cable in calgary, but a: i'm
in victoria (b.c., canada) and b: i don't think an address in calgary would
help you too much....basically however i just phoned them up, and they
charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made adb extension cable for my mouse. hope this helps... dave maclachlan nightfall software inc.
