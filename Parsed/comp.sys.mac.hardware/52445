from grey mull subject help formatting nt disk array i have a northern telecom disk array dated that has two 253mb drives
units in it and i cannot get it formatted. i set the scsi id on 1 and my
software recognizes the unit, but i cannot mount it or anything - do i have
to use both drives in the array? any help with these drives or possibly newer software than what i'm using
(fwb hdt1.0 and 1.1) will be greatly appreciated! -grey grey mull ****************************************** * smoke pot, dodge the draft, cheat on * * your wife, become president ... *
