From Chris Gatenby Subject How do I expand RAM on a Plus I have a mac plus with MB RAM I have just bought an extra MB so that I can have the max MB RAM that a plus supports However, I can't get it to boot after I install the extra SIMMs Instead I get a sad mac Sorry, but I can't remember the code Looking at the motherboard, I can see that resistors have been snipped off where it says Kb path row I assume that was done when the first MB SIMMs were added So, my question is Are there any other resistors that need snipping or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged Any and all advice will be appreciated Chris Gatenby
