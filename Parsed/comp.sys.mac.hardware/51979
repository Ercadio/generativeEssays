From Chris Gatenby Subject How do I expand RAM on a Plus I have a mac plus with I have just bought an extra so that I can have the max RAM that a plus However I can't get it to boot after I install the extra Instead I get a sad mac Sorry but I can't remember the code Looking at the motherboard I can see that resistors have been snipped off where it says path row I assume that was done when the first SIMMs were So my question is Are there any other resistors that need snipping or Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged Any and all advice will be Chris Gatenby
