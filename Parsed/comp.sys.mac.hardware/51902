From avery Avery Wang Subject Serial Line connection between Duo and PC In article petrack writes I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a Mac Duo and a I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac I have used Procomm Kermit and Softerm on OS on the PC or PS I have used non Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking And know MY hands are shaking from the Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo fast Like via a modem or via a sys ex dump Could anyone with a Duo help me out I am going absolutely I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo or all Duo or all Duos or just Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was trying to use I was building a serial connection between my Duo and my I think the problem was in the Basically you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both A safe place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either One problem is that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong and only a reset will clear I don't know the But this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the It could very well be that you are doing things right eventually but one wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further correct actions until the next machine I have wedged my Mac and also my NeXT that Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any problem and at pretty high speeds I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses but I think the Zilog is pretty Hope this helps Avery
