From Guy Kuo Subject Re Q at MHz, it's fine I have had my Q running with a MHz osc for a few months I have a number of SCSI devices connected Quantum LP , Maxtor , Toshiba MK F via Emulex adapter, Pioneer DRM and have had no trouble Is this being done with the motherboard's SCSI interface If this is possible then a bit of experimenting with just plain old clock oscillators may be in order Give us some more details please The Mad Clock Chipper in Seattle
