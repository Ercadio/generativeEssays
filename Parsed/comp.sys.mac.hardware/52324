> i don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the mac superdrive can read ms-dos disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the next and a mac by using ms-dos formatted disks since the next *can* read/write that format. and if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it over the serial port using kermit. cheers,
