From avery Avery Wang Subject Re Can Mac Superdrives read Unix disks In article Warren DeLano writes Does anyone know of a program or utility that will enable the Mac to read Unix NeXT disks Thanks Warren I don't know the answer to your direct question but if the Mac Superdrive can read MS DOS disks can it then you can transfer files between the NeXT and a Mac by using MS DOS formatted disks since the NeXT can read write that And if you're interested in transferring files you can also do it over the serial port using cheers Avery
