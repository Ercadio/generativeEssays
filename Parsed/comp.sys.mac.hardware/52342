From Carter Gregory Subject Re Computer Engr Computer Science In article Chung Hsiung Yang writes In article tecot Edward Tecot writes A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about meaning the Engineer makes more than The is not just a joke Scott For the most part this is a bunch of I've got a Computer Engineering degree yet I've spent the last years writing software that people actually Moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect I received job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were year lower My advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take emt Well here is my Advice from a grad I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about In my five years of education in this field though brief compare to alot of people I had to think about this kind of question a Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS The more I go thru school the more I believe that this kind of question is Interesting as I think computer technology is now becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position which must require a I know of several people I work with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have a BS degree in comp yet they make a They also didn't have to pay grand to thier local University I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade practice than a truly specialty It will be even more so in the If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you choose CS as I did I suggest checking out the emerging field of Software The difficulties for example of designing scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person can handle to million lines of code all by himself in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment is truly a gigantic going to be solved any time soon hey you could be the person that provides the missing key for some good groundwork I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for Everything is interwoven and CS CE and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each My advice is don't limit yourself but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as Beside I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her his sophamore Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case you suffer a little more and go to grad About the Don't look at the averages if you are good you are going to earn more money than anyone If you are a superstar programmer you will earn Like wise if you are a hotshot computer Well if your like the poor slobs in the me you are in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out of a Top comp sci The trick is to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the rest of your ME its the best way to if you don't get a TOP Which I have always been a poor slob throughout school but if you follow this rule BOOK SALARY FOOD SHELTER you should always have a computer and you won't go What else could a man want Chung Yang Greg Carter
