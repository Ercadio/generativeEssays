From Subject Re AD conversion Brian Clark writes In article wrote I am working a data acquisition and analysis program to collect data from insect sensory stuff deleted Another alternative is the use of the sound input Can you really make due with the non existent dynamic range of an bit converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps AC coupled as well It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency maximum about action potentials per seconds and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal So the resolution of about you get with an bit convertor is more then AC coupling does not have to be a problem either since in many cases you are not interested in the DC My pre amplifier is AC coupled The critical point is the lowest frequency that will If the cutoff point is to high the action potentials will be slightly But even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is However I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start battling with the toolbox to get it As yet I have no clue were to start looking for the technical
