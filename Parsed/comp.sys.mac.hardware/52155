From Dale A Dale Adams Subject Re pin SIMMS for Q , be careful before buying In article C w v FCE news cso uiuc edu Marty Sachs writes I purchased x MB pin ns SIMMs for my Quadra from Chip Merchant I've been very satisfied with them in the past Either one alone works, but both together fail I called Apple for advice and was told that there was a problem with Composite SIMMs Only non composite SIMMs should be used with the Q Chip Merchant confirmed that they presently sell only composite pin SIMMs So, Q SIMMs need to be both ns and non composite MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many most MB SIMMs are pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting the use of Mb DRAM devices the same ones used on MB SIMMs to be used for two MB banks on one SIMM I can't imagine that it would be cheaper to build an MB SIMM using Mb DRAMs as the Mb parts reached and exceeded bit for bit price parity with the Mb parts some time ago It's probably possible to build a single bank MB SIMM using Mb parts this could cause problems in a Q I'm not sure why you'd want to do this, though, as a dual bank MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a single bank composite one Dale Adams
