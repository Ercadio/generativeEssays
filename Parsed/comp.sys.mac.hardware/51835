From Wilisch Wolf Subject ImageWriter II at Hz Hi A while back there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe in countries with Hz AC current The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work As I will be moving there this summer I called Apple to make sure and they told me today that the IWII as bought in the will definitely run on Hz AC current as long as a step down converter is employed if V current is used The same info turns out can be found in the IWII manual in the version but I didn't really trust Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary Just Chris
