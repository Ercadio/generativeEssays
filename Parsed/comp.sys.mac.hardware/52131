from eric choi subject re mac portable vs powerbook answers can the internal hard drive of the macportable upgraded to larger capacity? what is the specs? a 3-1/2" drive? lps model? is there any third party modem greater than 2400 bps? with fax option? p.s. i notice the macportable batteries are avalable thru the apple catalog.
