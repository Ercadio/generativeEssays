From Marcus Bointon Subject Sony problems Info please Anyone out there have a Sony I have one and it's very nice however If I run it in mode the picture won't go very I end up with about gap either side and top I suspect an internal adjustment would fix Anyone tried it Another problem is sub brightness Areas that are meant to be black or off the main raster are not very The real raster is quite visible when the screen is This is not too severe but it is just not as good as other Trini screens I have If I turn the brightness contrast down so that the raster is not visible the real image virtually disappears The raster size is just right if I use but is a bit too much Oh and I am using a RasterOps Thanks Marcus Bointon Marcus Bointon Tel Fax I used Windows for a week once but I feel better now
