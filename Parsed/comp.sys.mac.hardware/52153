From UC M Eaton Subject Q Way to connect PB , IIsi, P LW LS Is there a way to connect a PowerBook , Mac IIsi, and Personal LaserWriter LS so that I can not necessarily silmultaneoulsy print from either the IIsi, or PB, and file share between the IIsi and PB I know I can get the expensive LW NT upgrade for my LS, but I can't afford that Thanks, Mark
