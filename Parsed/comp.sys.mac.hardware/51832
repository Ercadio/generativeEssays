From Fred Walsteijn Subject Re built in video problems on Mac IIsi In A Fred Walsteijn writes I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines all with Mb RAM installed or ns SIMMs If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated on the screen The lines translate to the top of the screen and have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings they are a few millimeters apart I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly, especially if the environment i e the rest of the room is a bit dark Applications which produce this effect are the previewer of DirectTeX i e DVIReader Kaleidagraph FPU Another program which produces this effect is SpyGlass Transform while contouring a big array Thanks for any information about this problem, Fred Walsteijn Internet Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research FAX Utrecht University, The Netherlands Phone
