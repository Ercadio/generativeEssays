From Mick Mueck Subject Re OK to set lbs on top of Centris I had the same question for my NEC The Apple guy said that their monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment beyond I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to thinking the monitor has a small tilt swivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with Apple's I don't know the area of the base of their tilt swivel Additionally the CDROM drive is in the So I cut a piece of thick wood to about x covered it in a cream covered cloth and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top and the monitor Mick Mueck I HATE CHIPSOFT'S MacINTAX
