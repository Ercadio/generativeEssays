From GRUBB Subject Mac IBM Info Version Send follow ups to Sorry about the header but the Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a year of This sheet is also available by FTP on sumex in the info mac report as mac ibm Mac IBM Info Version The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the information out there so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate about what they are saying about their Since computer technology is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will be lacking or incorrect on So please just don't say the sheet is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to make the needed All prices are in US To keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to a As this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to Finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected For example OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware so no more of the 'but it is supported in OS disk software' data for the hardware section please Thank Note for proper reading off line this document should be in point Special thanks to ANDREW Chihuahua Charlie Andrew Klossner bell peter

the Mac these chips are not Years only appear with dead CPUs and indicate first to last year used as a Cache note both IBM and Mac use caches external to the These external caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of In most of the present Macs there are external caches built in while with IBM they are optional Though machines are generally sold with them installed Since there are many different external caches CPU Mac and IBM SCSI video disk and static RAM Mac each having a different effect on CPU performance and they are machine static RAM cache in IIci IIfx and IIvx seller

CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS Windows OS and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen A UX UNIX and later Pink Taligent OS by using emulators or if necessary the OSes themselves in a 'shell' how SoftPC or OS does Hardware In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you add something' requirement for add in cards drivers video and operating systems in the IBM world Intel Microsoft and other hardware and software developers are working out 'plug and play' standards PC Week Color Support Display Mac MHz Pixel Clock All present Macs support the use of bit color through bit color QuickDraw in bit color QuickDraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X bit images in Y bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y bit color Where X and Y independently are or regardless of monitor resolution dpi color to dpi PaletteBook or monitor type including autosynchronous VGA MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including hz vertically and kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor MacUser Aug Older machines that supported color SE II IIX and IIcx had only bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use bit color MacUser Special To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only or bit display capability built in but most of those can be expanded to display bit Presently QuickDraw is optimized for dpi display QuickDraw QX will change In addition QuickDraw allows in Macs with a NuBus slot more then one monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the VRAM Video Standard for present non PowerBook Mac's handling of built in video from a bit color palette VRAM provided runs a bit color display expandable to bit color or a bit Sound output Standard in all Macs since the Stereo sound became standard with the SE IBM Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware Nan Zou the use of drivers bypassing BIOS video hareware inconsitancies see Super VGA below and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware OS and program interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question Faisal Nameer Jawdat In addition IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present Matt Healy nor a standardized screen drawing toolbox like Mac's QD As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program OS print driver and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode OS and monitor type card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an For example one cannot edit a bit color picture done on a OS with a SVGA monitor on a with VGA bit color palette and DOS and still have ALL the colors one started out with Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators faster processors and modular upgradeability and may have built in sound cards CD ROM and Ethernet PC Week MDA Monocrome Display Adapter original character mapped video mode no graphics CGA Color Graphics Array colors or b w color palette bad for the EGA Enhanced Graphics Array colors from color palette and some lower res some versions could run at colors bearable on the VGA Video Graphics Array at colors at colors and some others these two are the most commonly All modes have a CLUT from a to bit IBM or a bit Mac color MHz Pixel Clock Mel Martinez Monitors use analog input incompatible with TTL signals from EGA CGA MCGA Multi Color Graphics Array subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA CGA but lacks some EGA and VGA modes like VGA Dictionary of Computer Terms DCT Common on the initial PS implementation from IBM and some PS SVGA Super VGA This is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a 'catch all' category for a group of video As such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is In an effort to make SVGA more of a standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units but things are still a Video is either or today resolution of and at and colors are common newer ones since have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC giving bit colors at some of the very newer ones can do bits per pixel usually at Speedwise too much variation some very slow Western Digital Paradise based for example some very fast based for example some are so so like Tseng a very popular chipset Some limiting factors overcome by VL Bus 's linear address mapping were MHz ISA bus AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a window Other non SVGA standards a IBM's own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw polygon fill in Some clone implementations from ATI are the fastest video available today though some clone models do not have high end graphics co processors usually some do bit speeds up vector oriented graphics like XGA eXtended Graphics Array newer and faster than a only available for MCA bus based PS clones are coming out Emulates VGA EGA and CGA DCT Max resolution at same as a also some bpp XGA Accelerates graphics functions up to times faster than standard VGA in Windows and OS including line draws bit and pixel block transfers area fills masking and X Y Has an intelligent way to detect and co exist with other XGA cards so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be far Since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth isn't fixed IBM implements only bit color while other companies can have bit color through IBM technical licenses Refresh rates up to Hz ensures flicker free rock solid images to reduce visual discomfort and is VGA Up to on OS some monitor types usable by Mac See Mac section above for specific Expansion Both Mac IBM SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CD Main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM SCSI devices per SCSI bit asynchronous s ave and synchronous s max Difference is due to SCSI software Fast SCSI is a misname for bit SCSI in SCSI mode see SCSI for details SCSI devices per SCSI controller in SCSI SCSI is fully SCSI compliant and bit SCSI tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that and bit SCSI Transfer speeds are s with s burst bit s with s burst bit and s with s burst bit wide and fast Since bit SCSI can use SCSI software drivers and hardware at bit SCSI speeds and as such is limited to devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast SCSI bit fast SCSI requires a SCSI software driver and SCSI electronics but can still use the SCSI Wide bit and bit SCSI require a different SCSI port electronics and software driver from SCSI Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces Mac SCSI asynchronous SCSI built in standard since the Even though Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI As a result present SCSI Macs use bit SCSI as a fast asynchronous SCSI Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI controller chip built in Digital Review Oct though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide SCSI port Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI older NuBus Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and Rumor some Cyclone Macs June will come with a wide fast SCSI port standard and have a rewritten OS SCSI IBM SCSI SCSI is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as add on EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable Like the Mac bit SCSI is used as a very fast SCSI by most controllers out Unlike the Mac IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for Mac Memory expansion with a few exceptions the Mac has used non parity pin bit SIMM memory expansion since the While pin bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs only special IIcis could make use of the parity feature By convension both SIMM types are called pin SIMMs The IIfx used pin parity The LC III and all use a new pin SIMM that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing reading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem Since Macs made before Feb managed memory baced on data path SIMMs had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of bit The Centris and Quadra eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a If the SIMMs are the same size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting in a performance boost on RAM access MacWorld Apr Printers ADBs and modems built in interfaces Monitor interface and sound input built in on most present PDS Available in SE all

Architecture is identical to that of VLBus Byte Burst mode s Byte In CPU expansion handled either through the PDS or the Unlike PDS Nubus CPU cards example Radius Rocket allow use of multiple processors at the same This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved Each NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with RAM SIMMs on the card standard IBM Memory expansion parity SIMMs non parity SIMMs some newer models do a Mac like SIMM memory check or a dozen or so different types

Asynchronous s max and synchronous s max currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized Can have more than one hard ESDI Enhanced Small Device Interface s generally considered better interface than SCSI in many ways but not common enough for practical Outside of hard drives device choices are very limited compared to SCSI BUS interfaces New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working with old cards InfoWorld PC Week Vaporware ISA bit interfaces Has bit data path limit which produces a limit for which there are software workarounds PC Mag MB s Byte Uses edge triggered interrupts can't share them hence comes the IRQ Limited busmastering capabilities some cards aren't bandwidth limited COM ports LPT ports game ports MIDI card while

fonts Multifinder and multiple application Mac to of OS and hardware commands have been put into This allows Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS QuickDraw menu commands print mouse SCSI sound drivers etc in ROM which require clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks Which requires access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM chips Plus vs Classic for With key hooks for the OS support interface in ROM programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller This also allows Apple greater control over hardware software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and with some of the tookbox command code in

WorldScript support speedier and less RAM usage than MacWeek PC Week To run in bit mode on older machines it requires the 'Mode ' or ' Bit Enabler' Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades Bundled with new machines for upgrades otherwise The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system This can eat up any RAM benefits and cause other Apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system A UX UNIX Needs RAM suggested hard drive and a or equivalent to This bit preemptive multitasking OS is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac Price Note sound output was supported in OSes to by many formats including the following snd WAVE ASND FSSD QSSN SMSD SOUN and In the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats though most still IBM Machiness have little GUI code data and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into In addition what little ROM code there is also read into RAM a process called Shadow ROM This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' In addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is Side note The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS Undocumented Windows and There is deliberate code in Windows NT Beta which causes the install to abort if OS Boot Manager is present Gregory Hicks Info IBMPC Digest Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no Rumors the FTC will presue the matter likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new In addition the government has turned down Microsoft's copyright of Windows which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks PC Week

OS Number Crunching Mel Park Mac Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment SANE or Standard Apple Numerics Environment Floating point numbers are bits long when an FPU is present and bits Exceptions such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent produces the internal representation for infinity INF produces The above treatment of occurs in an FPU equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and the FPU programmed IBM Floating point numbers are bits with a hardware FPU bits when The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a On older DOS complilers exceptions could cause program aborts and would abort to the DOS prompt at the point where they Most present compilers handle this Result there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS Windows and OS programs nor between programs for just one Networking Includes printing WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript Mac Hardware Built in LocalTalk network port and a built in printer LocalTalk has moderate speeds Kb s requires special connectors for each machine and up and can be run off of either the printer port to include very old macs or the network port standard today Built in Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at about for each These cards provide three connectors and transceivers thick thin and for The Macintosh

DECNet Windows Work Groups AppleTalk protocols and AppleShare subset of AppleTalk Each of the MS DOS networking schemes are in general totally incompatible with the Once you have chosen one you are pretty much locked in to that product line from then Windows Work Groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this Novell Netware is the biggest percent of the corporate and in general is more powerful and offers better control management security than AppleShare but it's also more complex to set up and This will change due to the use of the Mac finder and file management system by PC Week InfoWorld Dec MacWeek Printing Very OS dependent DOS If it's a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and don't worry about it Tweeking may be needed with poorly written software Network Printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one software program to the Windows supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they are This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net because there's no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right Windows for Workgroups is more Mac like and intelligent about OS Mac like the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the Printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do not have WYSIWYG This is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the OS Price issue This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build in features than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars by both The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to handle ALL the variation in When one adds all the standard Mac hardware features to an IBM built in input
