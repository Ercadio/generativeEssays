From super bill russell Subject IMPORTANT SE users only We are having problems with a bunch of SE 's in one of our Labs The fault is that the machines either bomb or freeze when attempting to write to their internal floppies The internal floppies have been tested on their own and are fine, which means that it is a main board fault The machines all come from the same batch The date code on the back of the machines is December Do you own a machine from this batch Has any user had experience with this fault Was it a warranty repair Any feedback would be appreciated and I will post the results to the net Bill Mail William A Russell, Computing Science Dept , Tel x Glasgow Univ , Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G QQ, UK ARPA bill USENET JANET useBANGnet mcsun ukc dcs glasgow ac uk bill
