dept. at (609) 461-2100 and quote some plastic. if you forget the number,
it's included in the statement of ownership, which is on the contents page of the copy i have. a one year subscription costs $99.00 in the u.s,
canada, or mexico. i was told my first issue would arrive in 4-6 weeks. leslie jones
