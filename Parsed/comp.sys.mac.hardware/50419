From Howard P Marvel Subject Re your opinion of the LaserWriter Select My wife has one of I have not had much chance to fiddle with it but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines she complains that the print is too light for her The difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select is adjusted to the darkest possible I don't find it objectionable and indeed rather like it but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write black write white engines when dealing with TeX Is something like that going on here
