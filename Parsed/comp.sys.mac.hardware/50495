From Victor Panlilio Subject Re Whats this Thermal Recalibration on Quantum Drives In article writes Whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the makes a disk seek noise every This is consistent and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered Even if I disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity continues at second Someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a Thermal Recalibration Not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest disk drive I guess I might believe Whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every sec I can only comment on thermal recalibration in Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data Basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and so was used primarily on very large capacity mechanisms but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long term reliability and MTBF I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing say audio or video to hard Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk Hope this Victor
