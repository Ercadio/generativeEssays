From OZ AU Anthony Pun Subject Re Why HP printers rated so low Eric Gailloux writes I'm about to purchase a laser printer for my Mac and I read the MacUser Buying Guide special issue All HP printers except IIISI are rated very low compared to other noname bargain priced printers Why is that so On the PC, HP printers are THE standard amongst printer manufacturers PS My personnal favorite budgetwise would be the IIIP The IIIP has just been superseded by the M, which is the one I am using at work The quality of the print is execellent, beating dpi printers hands down In Australia the price of the M is about comparable with that of the III series, so HP are trying to get people to buy the new one Anthony Pun
