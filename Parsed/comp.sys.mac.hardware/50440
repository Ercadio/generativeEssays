From Subject Disappointed by La Cie Approximately four months ago I purchased a Quantum HD from La Cie for After two months the drive started having First there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then Silverlining wouldn't even recognize the So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned Well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having Often when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question Sometimes if I then insert the Silverlining program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the I've called La Cie again and they've given me another Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware Given that this is the second bad drive in four months I asked La Cie to send me a new one but they said Also within three weeks after I purchased my original drive La Cie dropped the price on it by over I can accept that a drive or two may be And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price Nevertheless taken together the convergence of these facts events have left a bad taste in my I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me for data It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be I feel a little helpless about all I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even But c' Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie They didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the What's the moral of this story I'm not But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the Bill Krauthammer PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the
