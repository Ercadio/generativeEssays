from richard ross subject powerbook with a math coprocessor i really want to buy a powerbook and would like one that can run mathematica. so i need a coprocessor but i can not afford a pb180.
(who can?) is it possible to put a mcp in a pb160? the guy at the bookstore says no but i didn't think he had too much of a clue. please respond by e-mail: thanks in advance, richard
