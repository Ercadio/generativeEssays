From Subject serial pinout to connect to PC Sorry this must be a FAQ but it's a quick fix that I need to take care of before a demo in less than hours from now Couldn't think of a better place for a rapid answer than I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac PC to the printer port of a Mac Does anyone have handy the pin pin routing for the cable that would allow this connection The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE How would this map to the of the Mac serial I tried one of those really short cables that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the pre MacPlus This cable didn't do Do I need a null modem adaptor as well on the side of things I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins thanks kindly Atau Tanaka
