From Jon Wtte Subject Re x x How do they compare In C npy LI Ravikuma Venkateswar writes Not quite MHz Pentium SPECint , SPECfp MHz MC SPECint , SPECfp But the interesting comparision is how fast clock cycle chips you can get an Alpha is WAY slow at MHz, but blazes at MHz As far as the DX goes SPECint , SPECfp But the is or will soon be available in MHz version, making it comparable to a DX Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola equivalents although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance is something that is highly debatable I think you have that one turned around they have faster clock cycles but less power behind each cycle Not to mention that the Intel instruction stream is BYTE oriented longest Intel instruction is bytes what an odd number which makes it hard to do any intelligent memory subsystem Cheers, h Jon W tte, h nada kth se, Mac Hacker Deluxe This article printed on recycled electrons
