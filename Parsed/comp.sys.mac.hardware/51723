From Kaneda Subject SUMMARY ZyXEL Strings I write I recently got a ZyXEL U It's great but I'm still having some problems figuring out what strings to use in what I basically need strings for Z term FirstClass client and Telefinder I've been able to get FirstClass and Z term working by using another modem's settings in FirstClass and copying them for Z However it still has problems Z term for example will list 'ERROR' the first time I try dialing after starting the If I cancel and try again it works Telefinder is even worse I can't get it to even wake up the So if anyone uses a ZyXEL for any of these programs I'd greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use Thanks in advance yoshio writes For zterm I initially did the following at at Then I set my init string to That's it RSMITH Rod Smith writes I can't help you with FirstClass or Telefinder but I've been using ZTerm and a ZyXEL for close to two weeks Here's what I did Once in ZTerm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to You've probably already done Then I typed at at w The first line sets the modem to ignore the DTR line necessary for hardware handshaking with most though not all Mac hardware handshaking cables The second stores this setting in non volatile memory in the modem so it's the default when the modem In the modem preferences dialog I have the modem initialization string set to at M which just insures that the stored setting is used useful if starting ZTerm after using something like the fax software or MacWoof which change the settings in other ways Alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the ZTerm initialization string to at M which would accomplish the same thing IF the modem is always on before you start ZTerm and IF other programs don't modify the Or at M would work even if other programs modify the modem's I do it the way I do because I sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching ZTerm and this way I'm assured of having the correct DTR handling when the modem's powered After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide I came up with M This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Quick summary of each commmand Reset modem to User Profile Speaker volume at fairly quiet Ring volume at fairly quiet Display connect info according to setting see manual Assume DTR computer is always on Dial speed at as fast as ZyXEL can handle In FirstClass I used this same string with the addition of right before the command in the setup This disables the auto answer function of the modem for I based my modem setting on the Supra and just changed the above mentioned In Telefinder I based my setting on the Zoom HH I changed the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass and everything seems to work Sorry it took so long to get this summary If someone wants to forward this to the info mac reports directory at sumex aim it might save other newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and also save the net some redundant If anyone else has something to add feel Marcus Marcus Lobbia
