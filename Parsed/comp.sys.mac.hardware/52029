From Richard Ross Subject Running Mathematica on a Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments from the gallery about How much slower does the program run on a machine without an FPU namely a versus a machine with an FPU namely a What types of calculations get bogged down the I primarily due moderately simple algebra integrals which can be dealt with analytically and plotting including d I don't do a lot of numerical Would a with a lot of memory and the very nice video port be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this type of work Is a with faster than a with or All comments Please respond by email
