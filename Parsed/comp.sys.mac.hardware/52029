From Richard Ross Subject Running Mathematica on a PB Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments from the gallery about this How much slower does the program run on a machine without an FPU namely a PB versus a machine with an FPU namely a PB What types of calculations get bogged down the most I primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with analytically and plotting including d plots I don't do a lot of numerical work Would a PB with a lot of memory and the very nice video port be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this type of work Is a PB with Mb faster than a PB with or Mb All comments appreciated Please respond by email
