From Terry Thiel Subject Datadesk keyboard Centris I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the command option keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift After absolutely no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech They tried it out on their Centris and had the same They immediately offered to get a new keyboard try it on their Centris and ship it to me overnight if it I could send them my keyboard back after I got the one that This is from a guy in Tech support named It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command I really like this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep On the other hand Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great Terry
