From Charles Herbig Subject Re Monitors should they be kept on hours a day Gary Sager gsager wrote BTW when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on There was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power This may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in I'm not an expert but having spent much too much of my life looking for the power switch or the brightness control or the de gauss it is my firm belief that the only reason any controls switches knobs whatever in places where they are hard to reach is because the designers put them there The real question is weather this is because of stupidity or Charles Herbig Unable to locate coffee Operator Halted
