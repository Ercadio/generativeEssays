From Art Beattie Subject Re Quadra SCSI Problems In article katinka FenK wau nl Katinka van der Linden writes I would like more info on this if anybody has it Our Exabyte tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra We have been trying it since September , replaced cabling, inits, I don't know what all All the industry experts we phoned the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software dealer all say it's our fault, or they don't know The last thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator Anybody know more Thanks, In article A , Mark H Nodine wrote In article C L , Bill Johnston writes In article A Mark H Nodine writes I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my Q and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive cartridge drives My solution was to get Silverlining None of the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives in fact the only loop that worked was the Macintosh Software loop whatever that means I doubt this is a Quadra specific problem I had to get rid of my venerable Bernoulli last year with enough cartridges purchased at each to make the whole thing worth more than my whole computer The tech support guys at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third party drivers might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn't format mount partition for A UX All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my Mac Plus and my Powerbook It was for this reason I assumed the problem had something to do with the Quadra Even with the Quadra, they mostly worked OK The problem occurred when I ejected a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes saying This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware even though there was no cartridge in the drive Mark I have been using the PLI SONY MO drive and now a Sharp color scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD terminator on my Q No problems If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end Some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and others are socketted These count If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets If you have boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled , etc I am sure that this has been covered by the experts My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each Good luck Art Beattie I only speak for myself
