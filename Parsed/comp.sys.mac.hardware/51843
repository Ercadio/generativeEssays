From Altan Stalker Subject SE Hard Drive Problem I have an SE with a meg HD which dates back to April When I originally purchased it I experienced the failure to boot This was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard Lately a similar problem has been When the computer is powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given the no disk to boot from However upon turing the computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just Furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot button the same problem But as I said turning the power off and on always This problem is different from the boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to come up to speed Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the HD Thanks Altan Stalker Indiana University Computer Science
