Subject Re Monitors should they be kept on hours a day From Jerry Stubbs Yes, I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldn't I keep them on hours a day Any advice Thanks Take care Paul I vote for turning them off at night THe stress of off on is a little harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but turning them off for hours or overnight is a good idea The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along with heat We have a lot of year old machines in the basement that still work, but who cares they are off hours a day
