From Tony S Subject Re DeskWriter Drivers How to install Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW go where and for what purpose What can be left out, for instance, if you don't want to do background printing As far as I can remember, all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and printing using the driver is to drag the driver itself either serial or appletalk depending on your needs to the system folder You don't need the fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward, bare bones, basic printing I don't have anything else installed and can still print on a Deskwriter using sys and HP driver Tony The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only BBS Number MacContent is Victoria s first Iconic BBS
