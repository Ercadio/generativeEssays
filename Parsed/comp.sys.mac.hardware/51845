From Laura Lemay Subject Recommend me a PS printer I'm in the market for a laser Used printers are fine non apple printers are fine but whatever printer I get must fit the following Required features PostScript dpi emough memory to download fonts The cheaper the I'd prefer under Nice things anything over pages per minute scsi output for a font disk smallish footprint Don't Care About PostScript Level II networking its just for me and always will be color I know about Freedom of Press but I've also heard that its painfully I can tolerate about ppm but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it I also infinitely prefer laser over ink I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm The page will include multiple fonts PS graphics scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures not sure yet The quality doesn't need to be spectacular but it needs to be clear and Printers I've been looking at used LaserWriters The plus the NT the Its my understanding that only the NTR has a SCSI out for a True Personal LaserWriter LS and NTR I have access to the Apple Employee discount I work for one of Apple's spinoffs so I can get these reasonably I've heard bad things about the LS comments I'm leaning towards the Personal NTR cause it has a nice small LaserWriter Select I hear it doesn't have PostScript but I haven't seen anything for I heard mumbles once about a postscript Used HP I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform and they were painfully Are they that bad on the mac I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite Any comments on this printer I hate the styling too many ouput trays but if its a decent printer I'll consider Thanks for any Laura Lemay writer of trifles in shadows and blood
