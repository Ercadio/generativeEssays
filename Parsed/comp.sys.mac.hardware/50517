from peter cohen subject re comparative scsi performance kurt tiedtke wrote could someone direct me to information on scsi performance for each mac?
: (max throughput, etc.) max thruput on a centris or quadra is about 3.3 mb/sec.
max thruput on iici or iifx or equivalent is about 1.4 mb/sec
max thruput on slower machines is slower.
