From David C Blume Subject Cannot move data fast enough I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around megabytes sec for very large data Around I have a Quadra I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at MB using block mode transfers I have a high speed disk array no asynchronous PB calls that can achieve MB Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer then transfer all the data from the buffer to MB s then MB s result in an overall MB Too slow So I tried the following scheme For an n megabyte transfer Step Load the MB from disk to Step Asynch send MB out card Load the MB from disk to Step Asynch send MB out card Load the MB from disk to Step n Asynch send the n MB out card Load the nth MB from disk to Step n Send the nth MB out Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all It is using the buffer tho' each of the steps through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after So there is no improvement in the Why Is the mac RAM dual port So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same Is the problem that the two devices card and disk driver both have to use the same bus to mac RAM Is there anything I can do David David Blume I get tired thinking of all the things I don't want to Bukowski Barfly
