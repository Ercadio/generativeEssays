From Arthur Gorski Subject Quadra PDS Video Cards A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra maybe with all but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video He reports bit video is too slow for good real time display of what he needs to He also reports that the built in video is even He's not a Mac guru and I haven't seen the system so this is about all I I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded and think improvements might come from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video Does this sound right Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats worth looking at Any other suggestions Thanks in advance email Arthur Gorski snail The MITRE Corporation NASA Road One Houston Texas
