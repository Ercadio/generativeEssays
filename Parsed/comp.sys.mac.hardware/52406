From Mr Stress Subject Hosed HD Hey All We have an old external HD attached to the Plus in our lab It had given us flawless service until last week The problem Someone in our lab has an old that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an aftermarket SIMM SCSI setup Digigraphics SIMMer the DB SCSI plug runs through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a pin rectangular connector Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine, to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug Since the pin connector is symmetrical not keyed he may have reinstalled it upside down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB He came in and asked if he could try out our HD on his SCSI port it had never been used Naive fools that we are, we said o k His computer failed to recognize the drive Now, none of the computers in our lab will recognize it We tried Disk Doctor, and it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain Could installing the SCSI upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board The drive seems to spin up all right and unpark itself upon powerup The events are too coincidental to attribute the problem to stiction Any help greatly appreciated James NeXT Mail
