From Guy Kuo Subject Quadra Clock Modification Long Here is how I modified my Quadra for higher Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher Your mileage may The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before My personal has tested fine up to mhz thus I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher Parts Clock Oscillators pin TTL variety You will need a selection of speeds beginning at mhz on The CPU will run at the oscillator The original one is a mhz I recommend getting a mhz clock in case you damage the existing I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey for less than Some of their part numbers are mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part Don't get the half size clock They won't There are also CMOS clock I haven't tried one in a They work fine in IIsi's Socket Obtain a pin socket which is in the same form factor as a pin DIP Alternatively use machined socket pins from an Augat style Just cut them out of the Cooling Fan A very small volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto It had a pass through connector which tapped into the hard drive power You should rig up something similar or risk frying your Procedure Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings Remove the top lid of the You will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic Follow the usual anti static precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do Unplug ALL cables wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power You may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power Leave that The plastic tab from the tower is all you need Look at the rear of the tower You will see the flat ribbon SCSI connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy Disconnect all these from the The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount Look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic A phillips head screw is at the Remove it taking care not to drop it into the A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the This tab prevents the tower from sliding Slide the entire tower assembly cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the Remove the interrupt switch It is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left front edge of the Pull the middle rear plastic prong up and The entire device will Unplug the speaker Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the Remove the motherboard form the Lift the front right corner of the motherboard about This allows it to clear the clear plastic Power light Slide the motherboard forward about The motherboard then comes directly Locate the mhz clock It is a small metal box near the CPU Note and remember its The new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin in the same Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock Some of the pins may be bent Simply desolder then unbend Be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this This is NOT appropriate for a first soldering The motherboard is a multi layer design with very fine traces easily damaged without proper Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once Put a mhz clock oscillator into the new You could use the old clock but it has solder on its This may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems I suggest using a new mhz Install your cooling fan system to complete the Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board Plug the speaker wire back into the Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about cm posterior of its intended Lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the Once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into Reconnect the motherboard ends of the DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY DRIVE Replace the phillips head screw Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic Reattach your cables and power Cross your fingers and turn on the It should make the usual power on If it doesn't something is Immediately turn of the power and recheck your If all is not well you have my sincere Hopefully all will work Turn the machine back off and replace the mhz clock oscillator with a faster Reboot and be You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly With my VSO a machine lock up might take hours of operation to In the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator hours I have not had a single Good Luck to all who attempt this There is a small but real risk but you could well reach Quadra speeds or higher with less than in Guy Kuo
