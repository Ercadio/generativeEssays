From RUTIJOH USERS Subject Re Re RE x video on Q adaptor pinouts This does not make sence why would the FG work but the FGx not work it is the same monitor without accucolor and digital controls works fine at x with SVGA what's the deal anyway you can get a SVGA with mm and x for at Damark are you saing that it probably would work while a NEC won't The FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of KHz, so driving it at KHz to get x on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance The FG is spec'ed at KHz, so going KHz is only above the minimally guaranteed figure I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at x Like most things, you get what you pay That's the deal John Rutirasiri P S I wouldn't have posted if I wasn't sure
