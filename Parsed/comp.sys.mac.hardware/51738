From tecot Xenon Stanford EDU Edward M Tecot Subject Re Computer Engr vs Computer Science A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about meaning the Engineer makes more than the CS Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that people will use, i e database, graphics, word processors, etc , while an engineer writes for machines or control systems, i e the computer in your car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc In other words CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is P S The is not just a joke Scott For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk I've got a Computer Engineering degree, yet I've spent the last years writing software that people actually use Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect I received job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were year lower My advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them emt
