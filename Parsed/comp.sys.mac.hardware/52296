From Beth Corbo Subject Re StyleWriter II Dying In article Davidson writes I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago and lately when I print something I notice white lines or gaps running through the line being It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when advancing I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem but the lines are still Has anyone else noticed this problem What's the best way to get rid of it Brian Davidson Internet I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I the original Have you tried cleaning the print heads With the SWII driver it's and option in the Print dialog Sometimes I had to do it several times to get the crud Yes it wastes ink but it beats those white annoying Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big black It can help to get the ink Good luck Beth Corbo
