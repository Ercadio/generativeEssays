From Paul Woodman Subject HELP FDHD failure in IIcx REPOST DUE TO NET PROBLEMS Hi I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM revision I had reports that this Mac was having trouble formatting disks and by the time I got to it the FDHD just would not respond although all other functions were I checked the voltages on the external drive connector and pin showed no volts with and giving The power supply is an Astec and I sent it away for With the power supply reinstalled I now get the following error With the internal FDHD connected the Mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays The disk is unreadable do you want to eject it For every combination of response the alert reappears within approx seconds and this error is The FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable of ejecting the This error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or Pin on the external connector shows pins and show With the internal FDHD disconnected the Mac boots fine and works great MacEKG reports no errors The external connector now shows no voltage on pin but pins and show Now the internal FDHD may be fubar but I have an apple external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external or the internal connector at after suitable surgery to the external drive The voltages at with the internal FDHD disconnected are as follows PIN Volts PIN Volts This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG I have tested all diodes and pica fuses and can find no Does anybody have any ideas Best wishes Paul Woodman Praxis plc the software engineering company of Touche Ross Manvers Street Bath Tel Fax
