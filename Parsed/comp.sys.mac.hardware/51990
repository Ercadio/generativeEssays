From David Schwarze Subject Re DAT Kelly Roy Heth wrote Hey I'm about to purchase a DAT Does anyone know which mail order vendors offer DAT drives with HP's mechanism What other mechanism is available out there Good bad points We bought one from Relax BIG The drive had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first and the software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive it was the new compression model and worst of all when I opened the drive up to fiddle with the jumpers I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL FILINGS Sorry to Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive This was a HP drive by the way and is now working fine knock on wood no thanks to Relax Hey your mileage may vary but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax Technologies even though their prices are usually about the Dave Dave Schwarze or NeXT mail Opinions expressed are just that
