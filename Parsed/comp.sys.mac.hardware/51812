From C Andy Cohen Subject Re My IIcx won't turn In article Pilon wrote Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard switch The one in the back of the machine doesn't work The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long TJ This problem is most likely the same that all cx users are Thanks to one very adventurous USENET reader sorry I can't remember the guy's name Somebody please post deserves the credit for saving us all it is easily fixed if it is the same Best I can figure it is due to time heat and repeated warmup cool downs in the power bad solder joints in the power supply circuit Go get a desolder tool from radio shack a low wattage iron and some good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit card with the AC plugs facing away from get someone to do it for It took me less then minutes and saved me at least for a new supply
