From MOHIT K GOYAL Subject Data transfer rate of the new series FS Micropolis hd's I have a question for y'all I'm looking at an ad for the new FAST SCSI drives from Micropolis in the June, , MacWorld I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions in IBM PC magazines Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI interface, but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is megabytes second, max How can this be I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI it had to have a DTR of megs a second I am assuming the megs sec claim by Micropolis is from the k cache I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can read write data at megs a second Thank you
