From Ray Fischer Subject Re x x How do they compare Dave Kitabjian writes I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck and neck for crunch power, but for a given clock speed, how do we rank the following from st to th While you're at it, where will the following fit into the list Pentium PowerPC fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC somewhere in the vicinity And about clock speed Does doubling the clock speed double the overall processor speed And fill in the 's below MHz MHz No Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor clock speed Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I O speed As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed If you have a MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every ns Sure, you can put all ns memory in your computer, but it will cost times as much as the slower ns SIMMs And roughly, the is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the Ray Fischer Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies Friedrich Nietzsche
