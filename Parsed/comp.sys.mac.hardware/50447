From Miller Subject RESULTS of Mathematica Speed Tests Well here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to this The test was the following command x y x y x y x y PlotPoints I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and The results are posted below Machine System Math of trials time min PB with tuneup RAM for Mathematica DEC Ultrix for DEC RISC IIsi cache RAM for w RAM Cache for Sparc Station RAM SGI Iris RISC processor version Sparc IIsi NeXT NeXTSTEP Cube based w coprocessor NeXT NeXTSTEP ave Cube MB RAM IIsi for Enha w NeXT RAM MHz Workspace Manager Funny how the IIsi running at MHz is slower than other equivalent machines lots slower in Perhaps the version of Mathematica makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did Basically though I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this It seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of I was just curious how different machines would measure Well if you have any questions or if I forgot something just drop me a line at Chad PS If the spacing of the above table doesn't come out right on your machine tell me and I'll mail you a copy of this in a binhexed Word
