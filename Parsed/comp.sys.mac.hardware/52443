From Jon Nielsen Subject Re Centris flaky In Jay Scott writes A rep at the dealer actually it's a university order center so they don't have any immediate financial interest told me that they have been having lots of problems with their Centris He didn't go into details but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the He's not recommending the Centris to anybody he says to consider a Centris or a Why he would recommend a IIvx over an LCIII I don't know but that's what he So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky machine or did Apple send the out the door too early Is your working just great or is it buggy too Jay Scott Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell given that a is way faster and is comparable in an LCIII is about the same speed and is way So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people that IIvx's are a much better buy than a just so he can get rid of all his old stock No disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended Jon Nielsen Department of Computer Science University of Western Australia
