From Brian Hughes Subject Re Installing RAM in a Quadra Scott Truesdell writes This is an aside to Brian Hughes's please let's lose the cute phony names everybody posting about adding memory to a Quadra What phony names My name is clearly visible in the headers and I sing the post with my account If you have a problem with that then you will have to get over I've used this account name for over years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last generally recognize Hades as my account I have no intention of changing the way I I installed a couple of SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed by the general complexity of the operation compared to for example the wonderfully designed LC It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how to do it in the User's Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble the devise in question it's the same for adding memory to LaserWriter Pro's It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with it's That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to I personally like the design of the and applaud Apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive I like it a lot better than the design except for those people who need Drive I do however agree with you about the LW Pro The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were offered but Apple leaves you working Again its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non certified service people to fool around with Apple hardware even if they did buy Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac just don't get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no longer After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs came into contact with the plastic case Mine actually contacted the framework with quite a lot of pressure enough so that the assembly of the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required some I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as I have not had problems with RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed SIMMs into an LC back before low profile SIMMs were readily The standard SIMMs would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the LC but it did close and work just One of the nice things about Logic Boards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of Hades
