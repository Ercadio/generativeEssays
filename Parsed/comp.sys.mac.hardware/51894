From Mikael Fredriksson Mikael F Subject RE Re Quadra SCSI Problems In article C L , Bill Johnston writes In article A Mark H Nodine writes I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my Q and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive cartridge drives My solution was to get Silverlining None of the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives op that worked was the Macintosh Software loop whatever that means I doubt this is a Quadra specific problem I had to get rid of my venerable Bernoulli last year with enough cartridges purchased at each to make the whole thing worth more than my whole computer The tech support guys at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third party drivers might fix the problem in my case the cartridges wouldn't format mount partition for A UX hat the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my Mac Plus and my Powerbook It was for this reason I assumed the problem had something to do with the Quadra Even with the Quadra, they mostly worked OK The problem occurred when I ejected a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes saying This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware even though there was no cartridge in the drive Mark t to format I have this confirmed from Apple Computer in Sweden I work for a Apple dealer as a service tech We had problems that Quadras wanted to format a diskette or a Syquest when ther was nothing in the drive This problem was fixed sytem Mikael Fredriksson email Mac Exchange BBS PL S Lindome Sweden BBS lines FAX FIDO Disclaimer Mac Exchange BBS cannot be held responsible for the contents of this message
