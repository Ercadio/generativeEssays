From Brian Clark Subject Re DSP or other cards for FFT's, anyone In article qjnpi , Thomas Koenig wrote We are doing heavy duty image processing with some seriously underpowered Mac's Mac IIsi, for example Most of the CPU time is burned in doing FFT's What cards are out there which would allow us to take away that part of the load from the CPU Any DSP or i cards out there, for example They'd have to be callable from Think Pascal, to replace the one and two dimensional FFT's routines in an already existing program Check out the National Instruments NB DSP This uses the Texas Instruments TMS C chip, which is a true bit floating point DSP It's pricey, however
