from state edu jt subject powerbook questions why, or how actually, can a powerbook have a x 400 pixel display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the 72 dpi resolution? (i assume that it doesn't, and i don't mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions) 2. any info on price drops or new models (non-duo) coming up? thanks,
jt
