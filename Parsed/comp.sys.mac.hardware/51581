From Andy Sun Subject Re Centris to Decstation E net adapter Dennis Wilkinson writes Not necessarily a thrid party adapter Apple does manufacture transceivers for thinWire and twisted pair cable media as well as an AUI Attachment Unit Interface They run at If you use thinWire or you'll probably also need terminators Apple's transceivers are self terminated if I remember correctly but I have no idea about DECs The third party media adapters are usually cheaper at least in Toronto than Apple' I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Joseph Gurman writes The DECstation Models and come with ThinWire only can't say for certain about the Models and so your best bet That's not Only the DECstation comes with a Thinwire BNC coaxial Ethernet The and all have a single pin AUI Ethernet connector I distinctly remembered this because when got the first and I thought all of them are going to be I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs DEC's oversized version of an AUI to BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable for the rest of the My advise to the very original poster Beverly is If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add machines to it EVER go for Thinwire regardless of the media Going for UTP unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which means extra money and I believe these units come with at least As for Thicknet it's a nightmare and cabling is Avoid it unless you have no choice the two machines are two floors parts On the Mac side you will need one Thinwire media adapter from Apple or third party MacX make sure you get version won't run on System MacTCP which comes with MacX if you get MacX you should be getting MacTCP with Don't use earlier versions on a Centris you may or may not need a terminator depending on the Thinwire media So just ask the sales if the adapter is self terminated or configure MacTCP to use Ethernet On the DECstation side you will need for a Model you will only need a T for Models you will need an AUI to BNC Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the This way you save the cost of a transciever cable a pin AUI male to a pin AUI female cable get a Your two machine network will look like this T DECstation Centris OR T DECstation Centris terminator T T connector Thinwire coaxial cable AUI to BNC Thick to Thin adapter Thickwire media adapter assuming self terminated Andy Andy Sun Taddle Creek Road Toronto Computing Coordinator Ontario Department of Industrial Engineering Phone University of Toronto Fax
