From Subject accelerated Mac Plus problems Hello I recently accelerated my Mac Plus MicroMac MHz accelerator and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk It boots fine from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I cannot get it to boot from the hard drive I installed a new driver, so I don't think that is the problem This poses a rather large problem I only have Meg of RAM, and I need to run Mathematica, which requires Meg I was hoping to use system virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica However, I can't run system from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM Any suggestions Thanks for your time C
