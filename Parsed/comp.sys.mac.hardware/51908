from tom verhoeff subject deskwriter drivers how to install i recently upgraded to system and now i also upgraded my
deskwriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1. i got the software from sumex,
but it is not clear to me where to install what. can someone tell me which of the files that come with dw-3.1 go where
and for what purpose? what can be left out, for instance, if
you don't want to do background printing? thanks, tom
