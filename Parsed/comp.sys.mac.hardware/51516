From SYG Subject Re AD conversion I am working a data acquisition and analysis program to collect data from insect sensory Another alternative is the use of the sound input Can you really make due with the non existent dynamic range of an bit converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps AC coupled as well It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data for some purposes resolution with or without calibration curve Otherwise the other possibilities would be get a digital voltameter with serial output connect to serial port on mac collect data with some communications Buy an A D chip from Analog devices Burr Brown etc connect to a parallel to serial converter use serial port for acquisition too much soldering and trouble shooting Get a board from National Instruments Data Translation Omega The finest solution but possibly the most To the original poster if the signal is too large why not use a voltage divider Two resistors cost very george
