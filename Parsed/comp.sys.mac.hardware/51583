From Les Ferch Subject Re LCD Overhead Projectors In A Jan Vandenbrande writes I am looking for one of those color LCD screens you place on an overhead projector and control the presentation with a Mac Can you recommend me a particular brand What price are we talking about For a good display, you must get an active matrix panel and a very bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel i e stage must not get too hot I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked it, but I needed a brighter projector I used it with a M It is also too expensive for what you get, IMHO Prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year something to do with tarrifs being lifted I think In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about to and a good overhead projector about to For that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam projector, but sacrifice portability Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that light wash out your display at the front of the room Tricky to get right
