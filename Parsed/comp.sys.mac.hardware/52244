From HK MLR forsythe stanford edu Mark Rogowsky Subject Re cd question In article , h sav dsyibm desy de Michael M Savitski writes Hi, there I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD I've been told, however, that The double speed of CD is achievable only on machines with SCSI This is completely false The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession capability, which I need This is also false What you need for multisession capability is multisession capability which is based on the firmware and electronics, not the drive speed I'll admit, though, that I have not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD The above , proves to be false Any comments The Apple CD is an excellent double speed multi session PhotoCD capable drive So are drives based on the slightly faster Toshiba XM Some companies selling such drives are Spin Peripherals a bargain at and PLI a company I hate and Relax Technologies a company I know little about other than that they are a longtime player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign The NEC CDR is also a good choice NEC's own mechanism, I think ClubMac sells it for around Thanx Your welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany Most of the mailorder info does you little good, I guess If not Spin Peripherals Club Mac Relax Tech Nothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony mechanism and speed identical to the NEC The Toshiba's speed advantage is very slight in average access time a minor plus and in data transfer rate a slightly more important plus Good luck, Mark
