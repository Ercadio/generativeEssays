From William Euerle Subject Re Centris flaky I've been playing with a centris for the last couple The only problem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are incompatible with the 's processor cache so I have to run with it turned Actually the main thing I don't like it is that it doesn't have a software powerup powerdown and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE I haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk but some tired night I'm going to be really upset with that design In all no problems with floppy and printing have been just printing is done across a localtalk net not a directly connected printer Bill
