From Brian Clark Subject Re High Resolution ADC for Mac II In article Rob Douglas wrote In article Charles Cunningham cec imager writes I would like to buy a bit ADC card for the Mac II with digitization rate of at least kHz preferably I would prefer one with good differential and integral linearity and DMA would be a Other than National Instruments do you know of any other vendor who sells such a card Instrutech Corp has a nice looking bit A D and D A board that can run at the speeds you The ITC doesn't have DMA but it does have a good sized FIFO that can buffer your Instrutech can be reached at or FAX I don't know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S N ratio of many of the bit boards out The NI boards are very clearly specified in terms of monotonicity S N ratio accuracy etc and the NB and NB have all the dyynamic range and freedom from distortion that you'd expect from a good true bit This is not true for the Spectral Innovations boards for
