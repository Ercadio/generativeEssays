From Chung Hsiung Yang Subject Re x x How do they compare In article BD C A zeus ieee org Michael A Michael Ameres writes I believe it goes or will go powerPC Pentium I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things I mean how can you say a is faster than a without giving is operational conditions Can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions Knowing that does not have transidental functions building in to its FPU and does, can you say that is still faster Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure processor architectural issues Or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design, then we can get somewhere with our discussions Chung Yang In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a mHz accelerator was slightly slower than a mHz accel But, this is using a system designed for the So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an ie quadra would do better So overall I'd figure or so Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system at the level of a fast quadra, but system or whatever will allow times the speed of a in the powerPC based systems and wait for the I think it laps the pentium pro life pro women Michael Ameres Internet Michael A
