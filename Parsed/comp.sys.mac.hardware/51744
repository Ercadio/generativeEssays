From Chung Hsiung Yang Subject Re How do they compare In article Michael Ameres writes I believe it goes or will go powerPC Pentium I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other I mean how can you say a is faster than a without giving is operational conditions Can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental Knowing that does not have transidental functions building in to its FPU and does can you say that is still faster Anyway I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its Or how fast a processor is based on its name because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it But if we restrict our arguements to for example pure processor architectural Or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design then we can get somewhere with our Chung Yang In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a accelerator was slightly slower than a But this is using a system designed for the So It stands to reason that a system designed for an ie quadra would do So overall I'd figure or Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system at the level of a fast quadra but system or whatever will allow times the speed of a in the powerPC based and wait for the I think it laps the pro life pro women Michael Ameres Internet
