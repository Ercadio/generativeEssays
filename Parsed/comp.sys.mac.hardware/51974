From Andy Sun Subject Asante Ethernet Adapter for LCIII Math Chip Hi, I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional socket on the board My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself Intuitively, the math co processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but I am not sure how good Apple's so called processor direct slot is when it comes to throughout Does anyone know the answer to this or have any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter Thanks in advance Andy Andy Sun Taddle Creek Road, Toronto Computing Coordinator Ontario, Canada M S A Department of Industrial Engineering Phone University of Toronto Fax
