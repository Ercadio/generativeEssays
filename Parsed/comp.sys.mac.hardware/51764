From Ravikuma Venkateswar Subject Re How do they compare Holger Skok writes In article Ravikuma Venkateswar writes stuff deleted Besides for wait state performance you'd need a cache I mean who uses a processor that runs at the speed of SIMMs Note that this memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of more stuff How do you calculate that figure I'd assume even in personal computers the board designers would use bank switching to optimistically quadruple the access speed or am I missing something here The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use SIMMs in a machine but that you could use SIMMs in slower I just pointed out that if you could only use SIMMs in a machine you can't use SIMMs in anything faster than a MHz Bank switching and caches were not considered in either example although both would help memory access HSK Ravikumar Venkateswar A pun is a no' blessed form of
