From Paul Montanaro Subject Re cd question In article , h sav dsyibm desy de Michael M Savitski wrote Hi, there I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD I've been told, however, that The double speed of CD is achievable only on machines with SCSI The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession capability, which I need Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD Any comments Thanx Your source is wrong The double speed CD is still slow compared to a typical hard disk The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI unless you get a SCSI Nubus Card You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD It's just faster reading images off of a disk I think that the CD can handle PhotoCD, but only single session The CD can do multisession PhotoCD Paul
