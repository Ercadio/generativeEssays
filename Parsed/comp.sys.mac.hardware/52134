From Marty Sachs Subject pin SIMMS for Q , be careful before buying I purchased x MB pin ns SIMMs for my Quadra from Chip Merchant I've been very satisfied with them in the past Either one alone works, but both together fail I called Apple for advice and was told that there was a problem with Composite SIMMs Only non composite SIMMs should be used with the Q Chip Merchant confirmed that they presently sell only composite pin SIMMs So, Q SIMMs need to be both ns and non composite Marty Sachs USDA ARS Agronomy UIUC internet S Turner Hall msachs UIUCVMD bitnet S Goodwin Ave phone Urbana, IL FAX
