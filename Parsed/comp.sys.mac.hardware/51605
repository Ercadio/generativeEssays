from michael smith subject re desktop rebuild and datadesk keyboard my datadesk mac e keyboard has similar problems i have found that
holding down the right-hand shift key at startup will work (disable
extensions), but the left-hand shift key won't (which is unfortunate, since
the left one is the one i instinctively reach for). similarly, i have trained myself to hold down the right-hand pair of
command-option for desktop rebuilds. i *is* irritating. cheers,
michael.
