From Brian V Hughes Subject Re Quadras VRAM Question Daniel Salber writes I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers On one hand, we have a Quadra with a monitor, which is capable of bit color How much VRAM does it have To display Millions of colors on a monitor you need MB of VRAM in the Q On the other hand, we have a Quadra with a monitor, which is capable of bit color only, so it must have Ko of VRAM Correct This is the amount of on board VRAM that the Q comes with I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the and put them in the so that both machines have bit color capability Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the Yes this is possible Technically, you only need to take out of the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the cannot really do anything with MB of VRAM It only knows MB and MB From the documentation I have, the Quadra must get Mo VRAM to have bit color, is that correct Yes, this is correct You get to MB by putting k VRAM SIMMs into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q 's motherboard Bonus question where do VRAM SIMMs hide From the documentation, they seem to be behind the power supply Do I really have to take off the power supply to access the VRAM SIMMs Yup You have to take off the power supply It's only a couple of screws so you should be ok Just make sure that everything is disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges
