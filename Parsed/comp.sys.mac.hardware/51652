From Paul Montanaro Subject Re IIci Q upgrade In article A , Gregory Dudek wrote In article C HA LOGIN austin ibm com writes A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra , and opinions on the Q upgrade of a IIci vs an accelerator card So far no responsed that I've noticed Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade paths Cost, efficiency, pros cons, etc Thanks Complete Q are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of MacWorld or MacUser My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors vis a vis a IIci are as follows MHz Mhz data path don't recall this for sure, but it's slower than Q style machines for sure Ethertalk card on board Audio in out MB RAM on motherboard SIMM slots NuBus slots More flexible build in video than the CI Uses VRAM In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you audio or ethernet or the same video options With a accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I think it ends up costing more Greg Dudek Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar MHz is cheaper than upgrading to a Q MHz The accelerator costs about whereas the upgrade costs just quoted from my dealer However the Q upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to with bit depth and up to at bit depth with additional VRAM It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're better off getting the Q upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an accelerator Paul
