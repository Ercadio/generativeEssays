From avery gestalt Stanford EDU Avery Wang Subject Re Powerbook Duo Memory system SLOW In article C yJ L LC dartvax dartmouth edu Espen H K Espen H Koht writes In article Apr leland Stanford EDU avery gestalt Stanford EDU Avery Wang writes Hi Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture Apple uses in the powerbook Duos Or in the powerbook in general What are the factors that make the Duo so slow compared to a desktop machine running the same processor at the same speed MHz How many wait states are in the memory system, etc What kind of a data bus does it use bit or bit Huh Where did you get this idea from I think you got this backwards The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop machine by and the rest of the powerboks I think the explanation for this was that it can refresh faster in instead of cycles I believe Things that could affect performance would be factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU which the Duo doesn't have undocked Extensions and background applications can slow your computer down too Real life differences in speed are likely to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen depth you are running etc Espen PS The Duo is bit through out Thanks for the enlightening post Is there a Technical Note on this The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac, but rather, any of various workstations that use the MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs I used to own a NeXT cube But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system on it Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power Also, you're right software does make a HUGE difference I have the misfortune of using MS Works on my Duo When editing relatively small K files, cut or copy takes several seconds, often more than seconds This happens with power cycling turned off As usual, MS software is maggot infested feces I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing Avery
