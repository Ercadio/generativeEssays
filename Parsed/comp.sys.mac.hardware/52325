From avery Avery Wang Subject Re Powerbook Duo Memory system SLOW In article Espen Koht writes In article avery Avery Wang writes Hi Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture Apple uses in the powerbook Duos Or in the powerbook in general What are the factors that make the Duo so slow compared to a desktop machine running the same processor at the same speed How many wait states are in the memory system etc What kind of a data bus does it use bit or bit Huh Where did you get this idea from I think you got this The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop machine by and the rest of the powerboks I think the explanation for this was that it can refresh faster in instead of cycles I believe Things that could affect performance would be factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU which the Duo doesn't have undocked Extensions and background applications can slow your computer down Real life differences in speed are likely to be influence by the software you are running what kind of screen depth you are running Espen PS The Duo is bit through Thanks for the enlightening Is there a Technical Note on this The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac but rather any of various workstations that use the such as old Suns or old I used to own a NeXT But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system on Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power Also you're right software does make a HUGE I have the misfortune of using MS Works on my When editing relatively small files cut or copy takes several seconds often more than seconds This happens with power cycling turned As usual MS software is maggot infested I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text Avery
