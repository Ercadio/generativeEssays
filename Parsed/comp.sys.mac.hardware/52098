From Guy Kuo Subject IIsi clock Poll Results Long This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their IIsi clock I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous of machines were able to run at mhz when no add on boards were This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work Thanks to all who contributed to this Issues Speed mhz to mhz appears to be the norm for machines without add on All reported machines were able to use mhz as long as no add on cards were Several Apple Nubus cards were in No machine with the Nubus adapter was able to go faster than One wasn't even able to achieve mhz with the Nubus adapter in place At speeds of and mhz the startup sound is distorted and hi density floppy disk problems have been Note Unless specifically listed below machines were not tested with a higher speed clock to Hence the mhz operational machines may well work at higher Damage One user reported pulling out the plating of one This was repaired and the machine is One other reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator during There is one second hand report of a user putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering No reports of static discharge No reports of high speed operation causing Then again I also don't have any reports from users of defective Add on boards Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus Several other add on boards have been used with See case histories Heat Sinks Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink These were often the TO style power transistor Some used Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacrylate There was also use of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the Case Histories All speeds are the effective CPU speed of clock oscillator All reported CPU versions were mhz Ran for minutes at mhz before No FPU or other add on card Heatsinked CPU only On hours day No damage during installation mhz operational without Apple Nubus mhz top speed with Apple Nubus card installed Heatsinked CPU only On hours day No floppy problems No damage during installation mhz Unable to boot at mhz Heatsinked CPU only No floppy problems No damage during installation mhz operational Works with the following two configurations a Realtech FPU adaptor card Realtech Cache card SuperMac PDQsi b SuperMac FPU adaptor card SuperMac Video Spigot SuperMac PDQsi mhz operational Fuzzy startup sound Problems with hi density disks mhz operational Fuzzy startup sound Heat sink on CPU and chip to right of CPU mhz Occasional crash at mhz mhz Using FPU rated at mhz without difficulty mhz PDS adapter with a Spectrum graphics card and a VideoSpigot a FPU Heat sink on CPU mhz mhz failed after several mhz operational quicksilver fpu only upgrade mhz Tried mhz system won't Heat sink on CPU Configured with RealTech FPU adapter card Supermac PDQsi Realtech CPU on continuously no Floppy works fine at mhz mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU On hours per day mhz operational Heat sink on CPU cooling fan No floppy problems at mhz mhz Bombed soon after startup at mhz with Nubus Adapter mhz rated CPU RAM ns in slots on motherboard mhz operational Heat sink added to CPU No damage while Apple Nubus adapter with FPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU mhz operational Heat sink on CPU Guy Kuo
