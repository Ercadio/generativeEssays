From RUTIJOH USERS Subject Re Quadra In A writes Besides the faster processor, the has SCSI , and as far as I know, faster I O due to separate processors handling those functions The can output bit video to a monitor with meg of VRAM and bit with meg Actually, the Quadra and both have the same SCSI controller, running at different speed They are not SCSI , but can support certain SCSI commands that take advantage of faster drives The I O processors are present on both machines The Q runs its I O bus at MHz, while the 's I O bus is MHz The Quadra supports bit color on all monitor sizes, as well as bit up to x resolution It also supports x resolution The supports supports bit at x , and does not support x at all VRAM on the is ns or faster, and ns or faster on the John Rutirasiri
