From Jamie Cox Subject Re serial port problem In article writes A friend asked me to build a cable to connect an HP fetal heart monitor to a Maciontosh SE No problem sez I wanted to demo it on my PB it won't work The PB has been used running ZTerm and kermit using both internal and external modems so I don't think it's the powerbook per When I send a to the HP it responds with AA a test of the serial It works on the SE but not on the I thought that the SE is connected to earth ground and so is the So I connected from the chassis of the HP to the PW audio ground connector still Any thoughts Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to serial port I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP Everything else worked okay on that port but not the it runs on two penlite batteries It turned out that the plus by accident or by design flaw was putting a volt bias on the serial port that was doing weird things to the HP which has only dc The HP worked fine when connected to the printer Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device Have you tried using the printer port Good jamie Jamie Cox Phone work Harris Space Systems home MS ROCK Barnes The Macintosh Meeting and Drinking Society Rockledge Florida USA Speaking only for
