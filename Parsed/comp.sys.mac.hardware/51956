From Papa Smurf Subject Re How do they compare In article David S writes The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC I recall there being a conversation here that a running Windows benchmarks at about the same speed as in system I don't know if that is true but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on David That seems about I have a Mac IIsi with cache card running System My roommate has a running Windows and from what I've seen my IIsi is faster in some In others they are keep in mind I'm strictly speaking of operations on the desktop level of Windows and System not actual computational speed in other
