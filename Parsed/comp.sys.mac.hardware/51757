From Eric Behr Subject Asante EN SC hangs SCSI devices I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old year Asante EN SC The T connection works like a I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain specifically a I power up the drive then the The Mac tests memory Just before the happy Mac face normally shows up the power light on the EN SC goes out and the boot process So I can use the network or the external drive but not both at This makes the Asante box pretty much It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling the Mac boots normally and the adapter works even though the hard disk is powered on and The Mac has never once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now and I've had it for over a year Here is what I tried changing the SCSI ID's of the EN SC and the disk several permutations changing the order of devices the EN SC at the head or tail of the chain overterminating with an external terminator both devices have internal ones underterminating removing internal resistors from the hard disk trying another EN SC box trying another identical drive trying several different SCSI Has anybody seen this More importantly does anyone have a solution Thanks a Eric Behr Illinois State University Mathematics Department or please avoid
