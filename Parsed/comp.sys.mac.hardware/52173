From Andrew Geweke Subject Re LC II Slowdowns David Gutierrez writes In article L sB B Andrew Geweke writes I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three LC IIs, a Mac Plus with MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX My problem The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's to a Quadra I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from the Mac It seems that something on the network puts out these packet storms every few days These storms have the effect of making our Macs slow down to a crawl Thank you very much These computers behave exactly like what you're describing Now, my question I am running on the lowest of all budgets, public education How can I analyze this All I need is some sort of packet counter Do any exist, and where are they Thanks again, Andrew Geweke Andrew Geweke The Firing Squad BBS, public access Usenet mail and news Saint Paul, Minnesota
