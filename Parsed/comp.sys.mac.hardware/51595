From Torbj rn Rognes Subject Adding hard disk drive to IIcx I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a We would like to try it and I wonder if someone had some good We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum hard disk and an unusable floppy We also have a new spare Connor disk which we would like to The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some problems The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each for motherboard for each of the disks would it work Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk What about terminators I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them installed in the other The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID The old one should have ID It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard Thank you Torbj rn Rognes Email
