From Paul Montanaro Subject Re TCP IP routing LocalTalk In article Ben Chuang wrote Here is the story I have a network with Macs on One of them has an Ethernet Card and is currently connected to a NeXT don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a baud Currently we can telnet from the Mac w Ethernet to the NeXT and then telnet out again to the rest of the What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet From what we have heard AIR doesn't do the Software solutions would be good too but my impression is that there aren't going to be Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers to machines so everyone shares that What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute TCP made by Compatable Systems This will allow you to connect your Localtalk network Macs to your Ethernet network NeXT and Ethernet Mac It will route TCP IP protocol between the two Software routers are also available for less money but I'm not sure if they work with TCP Paul
