From Jartsu Subject Good display card for multisync Hi there I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display card for driving a multisync NEC The NEC can do horizontal refresh from kHz to kHz and vertical from Hz to Hz and can do max interlaced though I am looking for something more like or It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite freely within these limits and is capable to display at least pixel preferably Is there anything on the market that comes even close Thanks Jartsu
