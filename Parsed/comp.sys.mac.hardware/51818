From Ibaa Oueichek Subject Cache card for IIsi I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi I can spend Max for it, what i need is kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter Or at least a passe through connector so i can keep my graphic card I need your advice about the best card i can buy How much performance increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the and kb Cache worths the price difference And what's the best price i can get for such a card i really need to spare each possible I have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu I don't think it would work for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed Do you think i can take the fpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket Would it work at Mhz If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu Sham u ya tha s seif u lam yaghib i Ibaa Oueichek Ya jamal al majd i fi l kutub i Lab de Genie Informatique LGI Kablak i t tareekh u fi thulmaten IMAG, INPG Baadak i staula ala sh shuhub i , Av Felix Viallet, Grenoble
