From Brian Clark Subject Re High Resolution ADC for Mac II In article , Brian Clark wrote I don't know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out , but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S N ratio of many of the bit boards out there The NI boards are very clearly specified in terms of monotonicity, S N ratio, accuracy, etc and the NB A and NB A have all the dyynamic range and freedom from distortion that you'd expect from a good, true bit converter This is not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already The specs to use the term loosely are as follows A D bit converter, with bit accuracy to kHz, bit accuracy to kHz No specs for S N, monotonicity, linearity There are multiplexed inputs sharing the single A D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all channel sample rate must be used Thus, for two channels, you only have unknown quality bits at kHz per channel This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate D A bit converter No specs for S N, monotonicity, linearity Each of the output channels has its own converter The price for the external converter box the ITC , the NuBus interface board the MAC , plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is Rather steep
