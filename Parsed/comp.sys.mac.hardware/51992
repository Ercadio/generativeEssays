From Keith E Folsom Subject LCIII Logic Board Re work I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re work of the logic I opened mine up and found the same re work with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two other I'd like to know more about Could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it Thanks a What does the re work accomplish what does it fix What are the technical details of the re work I'm looking for things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected and the pin outs for those Is a board with the re work any different functionally from one without Could the re worked boards be incompatible with future releases of the operating system and finally Should I even be concerned about any of this Keith Folsom
