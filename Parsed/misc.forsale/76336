From Mike White Subject Re eXpEn iVe MOTOROLA Handheld Radio For Peanuts Agent X writes I can no longer use anything Kenwood Yeasu Icom Alinco its ALL Well I'm not sure I'd go quite that far but I agree that Motorola gear is of better The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service not commercial service This radio can hear a repeater thats miles away without an Ok But how often does that come up How good is good enough and how much is someone willing to pay for it A good ham quality HT is maybe while a commercial quality one is maybe Is the increased reliability and performance worth times the price in amateur service Only the individual involved can answer that question and each ham has to decide for him If Motorola quality is worth times the price to you then more power to ya' But I'm amazed that folks make that For me given that I've got to spend I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone no matter how good it To me ham quality gear is good enough To each his Mike These are my opinions
