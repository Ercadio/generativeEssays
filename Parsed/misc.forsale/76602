From Wayne R Dempsey Subject Computer Equipment Garage Sale Computer Equipment Garage Sale I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by I've put together a list and indicated what I think each item is This is just my estimate and I am very open to any offers including I'm currently looking for some CD ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies HD floppy disks any used Macintosh software a Co Processor or basically anything you have lying around cans of soup the neighbor's cat Make me an offer no offer will be I really want to get rid of this Ok Here's the list Meg SCSI Hard Conner Model CP I bought this from a guy at a swap meet to use with my Unfortunately I can't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my The guy tested it with his PC and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk Doctor report which says it has no bad I'll send you a copy I was dumb enough not to get his phone number so I can't return it to The drive has many jumpers on it which I don't know how to set so maybe that's the I was quite disappointed that it didn't work so I'm trying to minimize my Meg SCSI Hard Conner Model CP Same situation as I bought both of these drives from the same Despite the different model numbers they are the same exact Same report from NDD I have one for each drive will be Meg SONY SCSI Hard SONY Model The drive mechanism is completely This hard drive was in my computer Mac SE and had a stiction Well repeated banging on the side of the computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which was not too pleasant to listen Still the SCSI controller card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a Meg Seagate HH SCSI Hard Model ST I originally bought this drive because it had a small stiction problem and I though that I could fix Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine and that it was a controller motor controller wasn't sending proper Well after taking the controller off the drive looking at it and putting it back together I realized that I accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the I tried to solder it but I'm not that good at soldering so I couldn't do Worked perfectly before I messed I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY above crashed on Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications worth well over Claris CAD MS Word Think C Excel and many others I think all it needs is a resoldering of that You also get all the software on the if you can accept being a pirate I only ask that you delete my data files from the I was really angry when I broke that connection and then couldn't fix I just don't have time to play with it any AT T ISDN This is for use on digital phone If you know what this is or would like technical information on it let me I have some tech documents on Is supposed to be the same thing as an AT T digital phone but without the phone It seems to be in working order passes self test perfectly OK I have no idea how this is Let me know if you're Motorola I haven't tested this one out yet but if anyone is interested I will get it tested out to make sure that it I had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then I spoke to the manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without another controller When I was looking around to buy one new the prices were around I will guarantee this to CGA Half Wasn't working last time I checked although I think I was using a bad monitor Floppy IBM Drive Type Guaranteed to work because when I took it out of the PC it was working Floppy Toshiba Model Number ND Guaranteed to Came out of same PC as Floppy Can't guarantee that these will I don't even know if they are low or high density I don't have any method of testing Panasonic Model number JU There's another number on it Panasonic Model number JU There's also another number on it Toshiba Model Number ND Virtually identical to the one Each Drive PS These things are proprietary so I can't test it but I think it Not sure if it's high density or low density but I suppose someone who is looking for one would Model Number I think these things are expensive to MFM Hard Drive Controller I've got three of these and I have no way of testing Two of them are bit cards and one is a sixteen bit card with a floppy controller built for the bits for the bit card w Interesting Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA That is standard nine pin to VGA Made by Hewlett Part I've sold stuff like this before and it was a huge success with many satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need I usually ship through the Postal Service haven't had any problems yet and the shipping costs will be split or Well that's all As I said before no offer will be If you can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out TRY I hate to throw away Wayne
