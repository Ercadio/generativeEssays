From Marc L Allen Subject Re DX CPU chip for sale, Cyrix, AMD s not Intel clones Beware, From what I understand neither the AMD or Cyrix s are clones of the Intel They are using the name because they run as fast as a Intel They do not have exactly the same instuction set nor do they fit into the same socket Most are very fast s without coprocessors AMD recent won the appeal against Intel to use their Microcode, so they should be putting out real chips in the near future Marc
