From Traci Collins Subject Looking for Mike Damico I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike The monitor arrived but it was missing it's power Mike's address is apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach If anyone knows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate I am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor but it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as Traci Collins Professor of Computer Education Colorado Mountain College
