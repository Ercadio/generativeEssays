From John Kaufman Subject WANTED OLD 's RECORD I'm looking for an old album or cassette The group is Sanford Townsend the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' I think This album came out somewhere around and I believe was the first album produced by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it If you don't want to part with it but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd love that Thanks JK
