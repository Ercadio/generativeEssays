From thomper Dale Buford Thompson Subject Is itproper net etiquette to advertise a company's junk mail list In article you write stuff deleted My company maintains a mailing list which is regularly rented for one time use by the major software The method you are using to seed your junk mail isn't really Bulk mailers regulary either send their databases to be cleaned by the NCOA which if you've moved recently will revert back to the original xxx Cool and in large mailings there will likely be a dupe of you and they'll pick the first and use the others for future BTW our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of a MS Windows utility product in the range and is available through Direct Media in at per Please let your direct mail marketing know about TEd It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list used for generating junk Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be done to penalize such an improper use Dale Thompson
