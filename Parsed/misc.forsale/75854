From Sam Bauer Subject For Sale Waxworks PC Game For Sale Waxworks by Horrorsoft Accolade By the same folks who brought you Elvira I I played Elvira I II and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games though the real time fighting is a little easier to The first two games especially Elvira II Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit point restoring was very This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park but it is quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting In one of the four wax works to be explored there is no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain moderately challanging The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs one for each of the four exhibits you must In starting each one your character is transported with no objects to use and experience level One exhibits traps you inside a multi level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting mapping and puzzle Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing This is perhaps the most horrifying Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim and of course the police think you are You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face but first get a The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game as was the case for the Elvira games though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror All prices include All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise US buyers only All games will be shipped inside a box with packing insured priority All games include all original materials including box manual disks and registration unless otherwise The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to get the Those just asking questions get no priority until they offer to buy the Lower offers may be considered assuming no other offers at asking price are Sam Bauer Hewlett Packard Network Test Division Colorado Springs CO
