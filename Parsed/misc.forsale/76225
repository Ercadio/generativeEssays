> hmmm... interesting. what do you mean by walking distance? i lived in
moscow for 21 years, and if i am 5 minutes walk to belorusskaya
subway station, i cannot be walking distance to kremlin. unless
1 hour of walking is what you mean. by the way, what is
the price? i may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in
late summer. vick ()
