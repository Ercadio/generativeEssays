From Colin McFadyen Subject Re Maxtor info needed was Re UNIX PC Software for sale In A DoN Nichols writes In article Thad P Floryan writes In article colinm cunews Colin McFadyen writes Does anyone know what the jumpers should be set to on the Maxtor I have a that came off of a VS that I would like to use on a PC Useful info about the Maxtor drive deleted Since the B normally has only one HD, you would jumper betwwwn C to select the first possible drive address if the is your second drive on the B , then jumper between C However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX PC' Also note the strange cross posting as he probably did not , so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends to mount it on If it is a PC or clone , then the C jumper would be the correct choice I've left the cross posting in effect, since I'm not sure which newsgroup he would really be reading this in Sorry for any confusion I may have created The disk did come out of a VS and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone The reason that I posted to comp sys b was because I saw the drive XT mentioned in a for slae notice I had asked for info before but didn't receive any replies Thanks once again for the help Colin
