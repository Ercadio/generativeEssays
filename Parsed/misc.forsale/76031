From John M Davison Subject TCD DAT Walkman For Sale I recently backed out of purchasing an almost unused Sony TCD DAT Walkman having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer and am paying more for However it's still a heck of a machine for the price it is quite rugged and many people out there swear by It's probably the most popular walkman style DAT machine out Anyway the guy selling it is Bryan Davis and here's what he told me Here is what is included TCD RCA to Stereo plug One for analog input one for analog Optical digital I O cable one lead for input one for output A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your The unit is still under factory AC adaptor battery Rechargable I paid tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the minute tape it came with I have some samples on it By the way he spent at least too much for it unless he's including an extended warranty which is advised for DAT machines since it costs about to replace the head when it wears out and it probably will within years if you use it a davisonj I'm not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be Send him mail and ask him what he Again I've used the TCD and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it I've been using one for a little while and although I had some problems with it recently I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been used during that This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live Bryan Davis says I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in who use that model and have been for a while with no reported My problem is that everyone I know already has 'nuff The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono plug SPDIF I O instead of optical I don't have any optical ports on my equipment but you the reader might and it also has some other bells whistles that the TCD doesn' I am also paying more for the Note that phono plug to optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have Of course it has All consumer decks So do Sony Minidiscs by the Anyway if you're interested get in touch with John Davison
