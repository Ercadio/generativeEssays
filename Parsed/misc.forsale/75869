from andrei broder subject re squaw lift tickets available for each tickets midweek are now down to they will be $25 starting last
week in april, or maybe first week in may. by the way, the current
conditions (was there apr 12-13) are great for spring skiing, with
excellent coverage, most stuff open, and no lift lines. - andrei
