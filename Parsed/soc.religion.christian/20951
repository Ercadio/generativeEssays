From Dan Johnson Subject Re intolerance eternal life etc I apologize if this article is slightly confusing and The origonal draft didn't make it through the moderators quote So I did violence to it but if you remember the article I am responding to it should still make In article James Sledd writes Hi Xian Netters God bless you What no hello for heathan netters I feel all left out deletia table of content intro homosexuality INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST deletia incorrect attributions Uh you have your attributions wrong you were responding to my article so Dan Johnson should be the In article Jayne Kulikauskas writes deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for Little in the cosmic Ah in the cosmic but who lives in the cosmic sence Not me Cosmicly we don't even exist for all practical I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to It would just say don't Luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk In a human sence you can have big Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into But the influence of Aristotle Confucious Alexander Ceasar and countless others is still with us although their works have But they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing even if they are utterly Mankind itself will one day One day well unless you believe in the Second Coming which I do not But in that time we can make a Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical without God it is all pointless in the In the But it must be the end until then there is all the point you can And when that end comes there will be nobody to ask Gee I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna make much of a difference ulitmately ya know But they will have already have made a difference great or small before the Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile Most people are able to live with that and for them little purposes success money power effecting change helping others Little is in the eye of the beholder of I suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or are at least able to put it out of their I don't doubt But I have thought about the cosmic And it does not seem to mean much to us here To me it is comforting to know that reality is an I would not find this But perhaps it is merely my Here's what I think the relevant terms are Reality That which is Illusion That which is not real but seems to Real Objectively Existing For reality to be an illusion would mean then That which is real is not real but seems to Or That which objectively exists does not objectively exist but does seem to objectively From which we can conclude that unless you want to get a contradiction that no things objectively But I have a problem with this because I would like to say that I objectively exist if nothing Cogito Ergo Sum and all Perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean Objective Reality is Unreachable by Which is not so bad and so far as I know is That the true reality underneath the the physical is Have If reality is an illusion isn't True Reality an illusion too And if True Reality is spirit doens't that make Spirit an Illusion as well If I am not distinctly confused this is getting positively That this world is a school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls That is one hell of a statement although perhaps Do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so If so please show that this is If not please explain how this can give a purpose to That gives a purpose to my little purposes How does it do that Wouldn't the world school w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose rather than a purpose in and takes some of the pressure What pressure It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to It is not necessary to be a success in human terms unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be Indeed many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as I understand Check out yer Buddhist monk type Out for nirvana which is not at all the same It's more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love especially when it's dificult to do Honest effort is rewarded by God he knows our Why is learning to love a goal What happens if you fail in this goal To you To God To the mysterious Purpose deletia question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly TWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION What is the nature of eternal life How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it Possible answer for The best we can do is Metaphor Analogy Question What is the best metaphor I'll have a crack at The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name It is the concept of life without death life without We can put together word to describe it but we cannot imagine No metaphor is adequate next to eternity if it were we could not understand it or so I suspect Dan Johnson And God said Jeeze this is dull and it WAS Genesis These opinions probably show what I
