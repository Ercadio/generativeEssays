From Carol Alvin Subject Re The arrogance of Christians Virgilio Dean Velasco writes In article A Carol Alvin writes Virgilio Dean Velasco writes Carol Alvin writes Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes The answer to both questions is an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations True in every instance Do you agree with this definition Yes I do agree with your example of women covering their heads and not speaking Hold I said that all of scripture is However discerning exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for However this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on Yes my I agree that there is truth in There are principles to be learned from Claiming that that truth is absolute though seems to imply a literal reading of the If it were absolute truth constant across time culture then no interpretation would be It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to To me that doesn't mean that one person is right and the other is I believe that God transcends our simple minds and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this God knows me and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else' By claiming that scripture is absolute then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be I just don't believe that God is that Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute And there are plenty of other Can you reconcile this The Bible preaches absolute However exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of As I said the Bible does preach absolute Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear at least to evangelicals This is where the arrogance comes in to Since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter of human interpretation and therefore error Yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear Maybe to a certain segment of Christianity but to It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is God revealed his Truths to the world through His It is utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate Practically anything can be misinterpreted especially when it comes to matters of right and Care to deny that Not at I think it supports my position much more effectively than So I think that your position is The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth Did I get that right What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldn't act upon them What practical difference can this make Carol Alvin
