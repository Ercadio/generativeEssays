at LOVE IN THE MORNING Psalm by Malcolm Smith Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of A generation before the time of its writing the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh gateway to Canaan and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than God's They refused an adventure of faith in God which would have given them Canaan the homeland of God honored their decision and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the The young decision makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old and destined to be dead within forty bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy eighty at the The lives of these wanderers had been unending Moses described it as ending each year with a sigh The fact that they knew give or take a few months when they were going to die underscored the meaninglessness of their Whatever heights of success they reached they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty The only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb who had stood against the nation at Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the The forty year period was finally drawing to an The new generation those who were children at Kadesh were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to In the light of this Moses is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be All these years as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile he had carried a double His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at The problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their If Who is your God they would have described Him as the God who is When Aaron had created their concept of God in an he chose a or young bull a symbol of power of In their minds God was the young bull who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led Israel to But when man worships a God of power His miracles grow thin and even After miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the God of Almightiness becomes ho hum What' s next on the miracle menu And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull He might be all they need but knows If He has all power He has a right to do whatever He wants whenever He The only person these people had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh and men's lives had hung on the whim of his moods which could change with the They believed God could work His wonders on their behalf but they did not know HIM and so could not trust Israel had a God based on what He DID His acts Moses knew the heart of God the motivation behind the From the day of his encounter at the burning bush Moses had been fascinated by At Sinai he asked to be shown His know who He really He had seen what God had done he wanted to know who God This request was granted and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and lovingkindness Exodus The word lovingkindness is not to be understood as a human kind of It speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a It can only be understood as the love that says I will never leave you nor forsake Lovingkindness is as tenacious as a British bulldog when the world walks out this love digs in its heels and refuses to it is not human romantic love based on feelings and rooted in It is a love of covenant commitment and therefore operates quite apart from God's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our highest and best and to bring us to our fullest potential as God does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings of love toward do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with us If that were the case the first ugly sinful thing we did would cause Him to reject He is Love and He loves us because of who He is not because of who we He does not love what we do but He is committed to us pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of He will not let us His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to It is saying to the recipient For as long as we shall live I am for The God who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and finally in Jesus in His coming and in His death and resurrection is the God who is Thus He loves us and gives Himself to will never leave us nor forsake Tragically many believers have never seen Him as love they see Him as No one will come to faith by just seeing Miracles point to who He is and that is when faith springs in the Israel did not see God as lovingkindness they saw His acts of Moses knew His ways the kind of God He was and the love that He had for these Because of their total lack of understanding of His love they could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the Faith is born out of knowing the love He has for us it is the resting response to the One who gives Himself to He is not the force and to call Him the Almighty is to miss His He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite If man is to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in But the power that issues from love demands faith in the Person of love The forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the God of At this point with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that God promised Moses prays verse The language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother's love now waking to look up into the delight of her It is waking to the consciousness of being watched over cared for protected fed and cleaned day and night by the Suppose we were to ask What has the baby done to deserve this or Have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience Our questions would be considered unnatural even The child was conceived in love anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into The parents' love is unconditional has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its So God is He loves us unconditionally We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after His image to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the Lord It is slanderous and immoral to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that The child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch through the cuddles of its parents' It is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or if it survives will have severe emotional And a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from Moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning resting with total confidence in the love of and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and Significantly Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His in the Hebrew is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet It is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life giving love of That sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and When we are satisfied in our deepest selves many of our emotional and even our physical problems Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human hours have meaning which make sense out of the ordinary and Apart from God man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the exciting of the emotions and through the feeding of his will even seek it in religious But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life make As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken Moses prayed this I find it fascinating that he should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His Considering the awe with which the people held one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and by the knowledge they gained they would live in But Moses knew God is the only one who can make known to us His We won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us God It is God himself the Lover who must open our eyes and satisfy us with His This prayer is man in helplessness asking God to make the love He is real in our Moses' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in The Book of But it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit who pours out the love of God in our hearts Romans In the history of the early Church we read of the Holy Spirit falling upon the This is an ancient expression that in modern English means to give a bear It is used in Luke to describe the father running to the prodigal and falling on his neck and kissing The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your This is not a one time experience to be filed in our spiritual Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are The world and much of our religious training has taught us to perform in order to be We have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for find acceptance and love from others and from We now come humbled to receive love we cannot be still and let Him tell us we are loved to let the Holy Spirit descend into us pouring out the love of We come in stillness to think on and repeat His words of love to our which have been jaded with the doctrine of perform to be We begin to realize that He loves us as we are and gives meaning and purpose to all of I challenge everyone reading this to begin each day from the moment you open your eyes by celebrating the God of love and praying this You may not feel anything but SOMETHING ALWAYS I was X rayed the other I did not see or feel anything but I noted that the technicians kept behind protective They know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are Such experiential knowledge will produce according to Moses joy and gladness all our Joy is the result of a life that is functioning as God intended us to function when He made You might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak Man' s highest performance is to rest in the love God has for the hum will be joy and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in Stop wandering in the Be satisfied with His love and in joy day by day receive all His promised End Included Message
