From Brad Kaiser Subject Re What WAS the immaculate conception In article M Joe Moore writes speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin It was a gift from I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers consider You alone and your Mother are more beautiful than any others For there is no blemish in you nor any stains upon your Who of my children can compare in beauty to these Ephrem the Syrian Nisibene Hymns around Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary a Virgin not only undefiled but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate free of every stain of Ambrose Commentary on Psalm There are many As the tenets of faith developed particularly with Augustine sin was more and more equated with sex and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of God We have for instance Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of Holy Mary and being questioned did not immediately add the Virgin And to Holy Mary Virgin is invariably added for that Holy Woman remains Epiphanus of Salamis Panacea against all heresies between We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of Mary For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord home of the Eternal King with the seed of human Anyone who proposes this is merely proposing that Christ could not be born of a Pope Siricius Letter to Anysius Bishop of Thessalonica Note that Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in I don't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was but I'm quite sure it was after The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated long before Augustine's We hold that it originated with the Strictly speaking however Mary's perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Since we also had this notion of original sin that man is born with a predisposition to sin and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin she didn't have original When science discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin the Immaculate It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception when a person's life Biology had nothing to do with Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Mary's sinlessness and the means by which God could have achieved this the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Thus the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine but the logical result of our understanding of two old The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at She refered to herself as the Immaculate Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the First of all Lourdes is private revelation and doctrine is not based on private The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation which ended with the death of John the Second the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull Ineffabilis Deus by Pope Pius This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma a dogma by definition cannot change and is required to be believed by the The apparition at Lourdes happened in four years The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of a sort of heavenly stamp of approval but the Church has never claimed that nor shall In Christ's Peace Brad Kaiser Those who trust in Him shall understand truth and the faithful shall abide with Him in love Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones and His care is with His Wis NAB
