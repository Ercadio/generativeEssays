| i've read the book. some parts were quite typical regarding its
| criticism of the bible as an inaccurate historical document,
| alt.altheism, etc carries typical responses, but not as vociferous as
| a.a. it does give an insight into how these historian (is he one... i | don't have any biodata on him) work. i've not been able to understand/
| appreciate some of the arguments, something like, it mentions certain | events, so it has to be after that event, and so on. robin lane fox is a historian and a gardener. he has written several
history books, perhaps a recent one you might remember is "the search
for alexander". he has also written or edited several books on
gardening.
