From Virgilio Dean Velasco Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In article A Carol Alvin writes Virgilio Dean Velasco writes Hold I said that all of scripture is However discerning exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for However this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on Yes my I agree that there is truth in There are principles to be learned from Claiming that that truth is absolute though seems to imply a literal reading of the If it were absolute truth constant across time culture then no interpretation would be I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require That's because truth may be absolute but it may not be Like so many things the truth is always subject to I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why I deign from commenting much The Bible preaches absolute However exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of As I said the Bible does preach absolute Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear at least to evangelicals This is where the arrogance comes in to Since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or Now hold I never said that Christians cannot be Indeed as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before this is a trap that Christians must always be wary However this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible you are necessarily being A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to So I think that your position is The Bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth Did I get that right Not You say that according to my stance we cannot reliably determine what is That is not what I I say that as fallible human beings we cannot discern the truth with The distinction is subtle yet When a scientist performs an experiment he can claim that his results are reliable without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been In other words he can admit that he could be mistaken without sacrificing his Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with Throughout the centuries philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered Cogito ergo sum yet we have not advanced much beyond Do you believe that other people aside from you exist Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists If so can you be absolutely certain about that Are you sure it is not some grand illusion Of course you have no such This does not mean however that for all practical purposes you can be certain that they So it is with The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality yet they acknowledge that there is a non zero probability that they are This does not however mean that they should or do abandon these What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldn't act upon them What practical difference can this make As I said we can never be absolutely certain that we are This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough in light of the evidence to render all doubts Virgilio Dean Velasco Jr Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics CWRU graduate student roboticist in training and Q wannabee Bullwinkle that man's intimidating a referee My boss is a Not very He doesn't look like one at all Jewish
