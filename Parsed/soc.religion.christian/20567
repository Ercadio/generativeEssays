From There's a seeker born every Subject Hell Cardinal Ximenez wrote Here's how I talk to non Christians who are complaining about ME Do you believe you're going to Heaven HIM I don't believe in ME So are you going there HIM If there was a heaven I ME But since there isn't a Heaven you're not going there are you HIM The point is that Heaven is based on faith if you don't believe in heaven there's no way you're going to be in people in the americas before the time of Christ children who die young Of course the next step is I don't believe in Hell either so why will I be there It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from But of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never see God so they do in fact believe that they're going to I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to They believe they're going to die Understand that you've turned Hell into a Using the same logic it also follows that all animals are 'going to ' Are you sure this is what you want to say presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell die a final death I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some sort but if Hell is as you described final death and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven In other words I'll never know I'm Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell because it's eternal Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died At least she's not suffering any more She's in Heaven Consider the following statement At least she's not suffering any more She's in Hell The above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of Hell it would be a true The person in Hell would not be Granted they wouldn't be anything wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever You say Hell death is However this loses its meaning to a dead And to me it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda Friend do you want the FREE gift of e ternal life It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an Can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all animals The difference is we have consciousness and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of super and it's a lot worse than That's the only comparison that That would depend on what Heaven is If God is a King and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King I might opt for I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book The Illusion of Immortality by Corliss The missionary started to speak about Are there seals in heaven Will we be able to go hunting asked an The missionary said The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting I highly recommend the above book IOI to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no immortality Alan Terlep Incestuous vituperousness Oakland University Rochester MI Melissa Eggertsen Rushing in where angels fear to Pax Dana
