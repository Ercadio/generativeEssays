From Timothy Luoma Subject Re DID HE REALLY RISE In article A John Emery writes much of the excellent post deleted for space TjL With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer it would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big Yet not one It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen from the dead especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those who I was at the Jubilee conference this year in Pittsburgh PA and the speaker there spoke of this as He talked about many of the same things you mentioned in your post but here he went into a little more I'll paraphrase as best I can Suppose you were part of the Christian consipracy' which was going to tell people that Christ had Never mind the stoning the being burned alive the possible crucifixion let's just talk about a The whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal bone and anything else that they could find attached to You would be stood facing a wall with nothing to protect When the whip hit you the first time it would tear the flesh off you with instant incredibly intense You would think to yourself All this for a lie ' The second hit would drop you to your knees you would scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at You would say to yourself All this for a lie ' And you had more At the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie beg for them to stop and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all been a lie if they would only It is amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such but for a lie There is no one fool enough to do And no one came Excellent post John thanks for taking the Tj Luoma God be merciful to I have fought a good fight me a St Luke I have finished my course For me to live is Christ and I have kept the TIM to die is gain PHILIPPIANS
