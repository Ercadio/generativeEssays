From Mark Baker Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In a previous article says In article A Mark Baker writes To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence is to deny God's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very nature prove Are you asking us to believe blindly You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question Does God exist self awareness and If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this Does God want us to be like that I am asking you to believe in things not I don't know if this is believeing blindly or I'm not sure how blindness comes into I do not deny reason indeed I insist upon it but reason only draws conclusions from If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence which they call faith and which is a gift of That is this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non physical There may of course be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses for all we These senses if they exist may provide valid evidence for reason to work And as with all senses these senses may be impaired in some people that is they may be spiritually In this sense belief in God becomes an act of sight and it is disbelief which is You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE However if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH And since we can only use faith why is one picture of God Hinduism any less valid than another Christianity Faith as I have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by Religious believers in general and Christians in particular use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by Science claims with good reason to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe and Christianity claims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of the best evidence for explaining Gods revelations of himself to If you doubt that Christians use reason read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate Mark Baker The task is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate Lewis
