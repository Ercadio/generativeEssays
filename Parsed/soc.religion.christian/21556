From AKF ANN KRISTIN FRYSTAD Subject Re How I got saved Hello Brycen I'm a Norwegian journalist student and also a Thanks for your testimony But I want to ask you one question What do you think of Heavy Metal music after you became a Christian You know there are Christian bands like Barren Cross Whitecross Bloodgood and Stryper that play that kind of I like some of it I feel like it Of course I listen to the lyrics I don't listen to any Christian band but it's better than listening to secular music Hope you're still going strong with Christ Ann Kristin Froeystad College of Nordland
