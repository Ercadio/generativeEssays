from lake nj us joseph h buehler subject re the bible on the immaculate conception in article writes + i will put enmity between you [the serpent] and the woman, and + between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall + crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel. + -genesis 3.15 in the hebrew of genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine. + he shall crush your head, and you shall bruise his heel. the latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar. i have yet to see an adequate explanation of st. jerome's translation
of genesis 3:15. his latin clearly uses the feminine, but i don't
know why, since the hebrew is clearly masculine. if anyone knows of a
scholarly treatment of this puzzle, i would appreciate hearing from
you.
