From Joseph H Buehler Subject Re The Bible on the Immaculate COnception In article M JEK cu nih gov writes I will put enmity between you the Serpent and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she can also be read he shall crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel Genesis In the Hebrew of Genesis , the gender is clearly masculine HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St Jerome's translation of Genesis His Latin clearly uses the feminine, but I don't know why, since the Hebrew is clearly masculine If anyone knows of a scholarly treatment of this puzzle, I would appreciate hearing from you
