From Geno Subject Re Atheists and Hell Imagine the worst depth of despair you've ever encountered or the worst physical pain you've ever Some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish in their lives that their deaths seem to be But at least the pain does end in What if you lived a hundred such lives at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another What if you lived a million a billion years in this state What if this kept going forever Did this happen to Jesus I don't think so not from what I He lived ONE DAY of suffering and If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE This is something I've always found a little I've never quite understood the trinity On the one hand Jesus is supposed to be God But at the same time he is God's son For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son First question is if Jesus was God in human form how could he really be God's son If the Holy Ghost planted the seed in Mary so to speak then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father son While a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities he is not the They are still two separite To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously In that case Jesus and God aren't the On the other hand if their relationship isn't the same as the human father son relationship but Jesus is actually God incarnate then he's not really God's son and he never He's just God manifesting himself as At least this is how I'm seeing Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us Getting back to the original question what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins Was it dying on the cross Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in days and then ascend back to heaven I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for His earthly body may have been killed but then so what He suffered a few hours of physical pain but then there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this To those people please accept my sincere It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize But I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at First your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon In this group it's dangerous to say that no one believes You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as I consider that terrible heresy though some people react less The Virgin Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's But it doesn't imply that God's sperm was Indeed one though by no means the only speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic Second Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the In a Trinitarian context the term Son refers to the eternal Logos who is a part of The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' Jesus is the incarnation of the So his sonness isn't specifically a result of being Rather it's the Son who was clh
