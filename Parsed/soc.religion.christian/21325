From Mark Ashley Subject Re Question about Virgin Mary I think you're talking about the assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary It says that The Immaculate Mother of God the ever Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly This was defined by a Papal statement in though it had certainly been believed by some before Like the Immaculate Conception this is primarily a Roman Catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct Biblical Note that Catholics do not believe in sola scriptura That is they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of Christian Thus the fact that a doctrine has little Biblical support is not necessarily significant to They believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church and also that it can be revealed to the I'm not interested in yet another Catholic Protestant argument but if any Catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs I think it would be clh In the Bible there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people where a person just came to know some piece of information where a person walks off into the desert for days With all of God's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants The Bible ends with the book of But does God's reign end there So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening I can now hear the clamor for With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group it's very hard to get the point I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints They're still The apparitions at Fatima Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's That was the spinning descending of the It was seen in several That event is approved by the Currently images of Mary in Japan Korea Yugoslavia Philippines Africa are showing tears natural or blood These are still under investigation by the But realize that investigations take decades to And if the message is Christ will come in ten days that's a bit too late isn't it Other events under investigation are inner locutions coming to know stigmata the person exhibits Christ's And they don't And doctor's don't know why Non believers are welcome to pore through documents I'm This stuff is not like Or Oral Roberts give me or God will call me home It's Find out why they're happening as we ourselves are studying why If anybody can figure this out tell us You can be of any If you have the resources go to one of the countries I These are not members only God and Mary invites So in conclusion finally We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not There are more proofs and And that is why not everything is in the Bible Although in a lot of the apparitions we are told to read the As far as the Protestant Catholics issue is In the end God's churches will I'm not sure I have some But the point is we shouldn't worry about the versus Just do God's That's all that Unity will BTW I'm just a plain I'm not the Pope's But I am Mark Ashley DISCLAIMER My Not Harris' The Lost Los Angelino
