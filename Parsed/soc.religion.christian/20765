From parkin Michael Parkin Subject Re Being right about messiahs In article Desiree B Desiree Bradley writes I must have missed the postings about Waco David Koresh and the Second How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane First by his The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin fallen nature and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original He also wants to create world peace based on The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God the fall of man the purpose of creation and God's providence of It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds so they may miss him when he Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus years They are still waiting for his first The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come Jesus said that John the Baptist was But John the Baptist denied that he was How did this reflect on Jesus Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look for another see book of Matthew I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio He didn' Still it seems to me that he did fool some David Koresh didn't even come The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show And from my meagre knowledge of the Bible it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while at the same time not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians How to recognize the Second Coming The Messiah should not claim to be What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally God's restoration providence is still not The messiah is the true Son of God one with God God's representative on the earth but not God There is only one Mark And then if any one says to you 'Look here is the Christ ' or 'Look there he is ' do not believe Mark And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and My understanding of Jesus' answer is that unlike his first coming which was veiled the second coming will be quite By the way from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Who else in this world is claiming to be the Maybe he's already Mike
