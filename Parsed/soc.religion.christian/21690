From Hal F Lillywhite Subject Re Mormon beliefs about children born out of wedlock In article M Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes Bruce Webster writes Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have failed to bring them up properly cf D C Hi Bruce How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel Ezekiel The soul who sins is the one who will die The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him Actually in D C the parents are being held accountable for their own sins Specifically they are accountable for their failure to teach their children properly If I fail to teach my children that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they later indulge in such behavior This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in Eze If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked, not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold Ezekiel responsible Similarly parents are responsible to teach their children right from wrong I suspect most Christians and Jews etc would agree that parents have this responsibility
