From vera shanti noyes Subject Re Why do people become atheists In article M maxwell c muir writes a lot of stuff deleted i'm focusing on just one point Well he got me I am a strong atheist because I feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies lack of However I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade Call me a seeker if you like I don' Weak atheism is being ignore here Some atheists simply say I don't believe in any god rather than my position I believe that no god s For the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve because they don't actively believe in If you think this is confusing try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view i'm a little confused about the difference between this weak atheism as you put it and is agnosticism not believing or necessarily disbelieving in anything or what is it i used to be agnostic by this definition but if weak atheism includes not necessarily believing in God then i guess i was one of actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not ever decide what they i am constantly in a state of self examination as it would appear many others are as well including the atheists of course i'd assume that's why they're here i guess some people don't really consider it important to think about the answers to life the universe and everything any comment just This is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in something followed up by everyone has faith in something Guess what My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's Is that really too much to ask tough call as these things seem to be based on faith wish i could help you but i already tried once with someone who was a self professed agnostic thinking of becoming a christian and it didn't work too well especially tough as i'm still mulling over whether or not i believe in miracles looks like another email to my chaplain is coming all i can do is wish you the best of luck and please do post what you And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually Note that I can only speak for If you find faith to be honest show me hmm how so i guess i really don't there are times of course when i say to myself of course i have absolutely no way of knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it which of course could just be psychological somehow i live with this anyway is this what you mean the only proof i have is that i believe God spoke to me once which could of course be my own the odd thing is though that if you don't at some point start believing in something after a while it all gets sort of maybe it's just a question of where you draw the I have been unable to reconcile it so Maybe that's how I'm broken I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for If you accept that you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you All I ask for is proof of the assertion God exists Logical or physical proofs only Then we'll discuss the nature of God i'll only add one question have you read pascal what did you think of him if you did also you may or may not be interested by cslewis surprised by joy i'd be interested in knowing what you think of him no sarcasm at all i just say this because one can never know how one's written words will be i am not interested in converting you since i don't seem to have whatever it would take proof to do i'm just interested in Muppets and garlic toast forever i like Max Bob Muir cheers vera i give you everything disclaimer of course i don't agree with my sweet everything trent reznor's nin's i think nine inch nails it's interesting vera noyes
