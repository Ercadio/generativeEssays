From Mark Gregory Foster Subject Re Sabbath Admissions In article A Darius Lecointe writes FAQ and Darius' response deleted Darius It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom is probably all that needs to be I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the I just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to I also worship on Saturday to honor the Your mention of esteeming all days alike IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the But no matter how you interpret that passage I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may To me though the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic this is simply not the Rather keeping Saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate God's goodness and However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first As I indicated there are responses on both of the passages Similarly with Cor It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes I can't disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly Paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority before spending their money on other I do not have any proof in front of me for this though although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the first I assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the seventh But I agree with you that we only have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip Mark
