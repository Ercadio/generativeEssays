From joseph dale fisher Subject Re Unity In article A Maarten van Loon writes Hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian to a bible study Alltough I do have a personal opinion on this issue I thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different My background member of a orthodox Reformed Let us say a little The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages Since becoming a disciple I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville KY came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self That is only one area in which disciples stand out from Christians Also another part of unity is a common depth of I've also been a part of some Christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they That was why they could be unified they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same Both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our In essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one But how that is the Creeds What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better So here is a first question can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different denominations Or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the Scriptures According to the Scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be As per a previous note I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many There are also differences of opinion and However Scripture states In the following directives I have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than In the first place I hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent I believe No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval Corinthians How will God show his approval By fruitfulness see Acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for God all having everything in glad and sincere hearts praising God enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts God also shows that those who have these qualities are Look at Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit Acts who was later stoned Acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of Jesus Christ One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a I have yet to find that but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to A problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other Christians from these two churches before there is a unity This question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one As for cooperation that can always Unity on the other hand may never As for those who think about only one church being the true one I remind them that Mark states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their As with the Boston movement I've heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less Of course few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the I know I haven' Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of For your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that This has been considered as correct for Only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this Some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches I must warn that this sounds cliquey to A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent This causes problems in fellowship and causes I would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any In one of the churches I attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple Anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still So I must warn against such division There's enough division Thanks for your opinions in advance Maarten Joe Fisher
