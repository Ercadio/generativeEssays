from subject acta sanctorum in english does anyone know whether the acta sanctorum , the huge multi volume collection of roman catholic hagiography produced by the bollandists, has ever been
translated into english? i'm working on the _vita s. dympnae_ and would love
to be able to check my own translation against somebody else's. email replies preferred, unless this query turns out to be of general interest. --
