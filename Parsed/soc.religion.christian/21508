From Dave Davis Subject Re Deuterocanicals Sirach Thanks for the responses so I hope that I have sparked some thought which is more my intent than to restart one of the Reformations I'm just going to tug on two threads In Message ID M Andrew Byler writes And I must point out that the Jews only drew up their canon in AD years after the founding of the Christian Religion upon the Why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the Chrsitian use of the Greek Septuagint which includes the deutero canon I was simply observing that as a non Jew I am not in that community which might be bound by such a decision I don't know much about the Council of Jamnia but I have heard that it is not well attested historically 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it and I prefer not to speculate about As early as AD Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain I wish the Dialogue with Trypho were a real transcript of a real dialogue but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's Putting that to one side Justin's point may be evidential one would want to know 'which books ' Protestants apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree of the Jews Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light MS evidence they Let's stick to the Again I prefer not to speculate about One would need quotes from Luther Calvin to evidence this 'preference' In Message ID M David Wagner That is not quite Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon as Dave noted One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Is this the principle 'Any BC text not quoted by Christ cannot be counted as Scripture' Think well about this Job I wrote These is a logically invalid a priori Besides we are talking about OT texts which in many parts are superceded by the NT in the Xtian view Would not this same principle exclude Ecclesiastes This principle cannot be consistently Dave answers I have to reject your argument The Spirit speaks with one voice and he does not contradict Meaning what Do you affirm the principle that the 's can be excluded since they contain 'false doctrine' or do you deny it If affirmed as is implied in your statement how does one determine that doctrine X is false Do you affirm every teaching in Ecclesiastes The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit God It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or If so it may be a test that cannot be The Orthodox faithfully believe that Psalm is How can my faith say 'Not ' All I hear here is the a priori I mentioned The deutero canonical books were added much later in the church's This is contrary to They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Can this be elevated to a principle How is 'spiritual quality' measured I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over Joshua or Chronicles any I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so What can I say You believe what you believe I'm asking for a consistency I don't see that the books were added in any construction this formulation begs the No one can validly ask me to 'have faith' that these books are Dave Davis These are my opinions activities alone QOTD Christianity is not a doctrine not I mean a theory about what has happened and will happen to the human soul but a description of something that actually takes place in a human For consciousness of sin' is a real event and so are despair and salvation through Those who speak of such things Bunyan for instance are simply describing what has happened to them whatever anyone may want to say about Ludwig Wittgenstein
