From Paul Hudson Jr Subject Re FAQ essay on homosexuality In article M writes this came Here's his response Kinsey see below is the source of the figure There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about were I saw another figure that listed as the Of course even if it were that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful How many people have commited other acts of fornication How many people have lied or sinned in other ways But in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality Paul describes men with men working that which is unseemly to describe the Sure there spirtual nature was depraved also and like the other sins the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying God as God and being Still their acts were homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some On the other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the Rom is really about It refers to homosexuality in Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament Scripture does not condemn being a drug Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism it also protects us from sins that are against the The word is a two edged sword that cuts both I think we must be careful before we totally throw out If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a If homosexuality were natural whatever that means wholesome endorsed by God and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow minded biggots as some would have us believe why is there a condemnation of it in This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that this was the Furthermore male homosexual sex was a death penalty crime Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament Take a look at I Corinthians Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles that one should have his father's There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it besides this Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery he spoke against having one's father's Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the It was just a plain blantant sin whether worshipping idols was involved or One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal He encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced Christians who are trying to define a Christian homosexuality which fits with general Christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between God and It is unfair to take Paul's judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other Sin can be tough to over come especially without supernatural Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin like lusting after a married woman or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex I doubt it and even if it is that is no God is greater than all of Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and That is a reflection on the people involved in the program and not God's willingness and ability to change a Any program that uses formulas may What people need is the power of God to change them whether they are involved in homosexual sin or any other I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral Paul's tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally For example while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal I don't see how you come to that Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too Take the example of eating meat offered to Paul felt that there was nothing wrong in an abstract sense with eating the Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to Paul wrote to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts Romans Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual Since others consider it to be a sin then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite Paul never offers a lesser sin homosexual marriage to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging For another example Paul obviously would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances remain Yet if they were unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to Yet marriage itself is not a marriage is holy in all and something that God ordains and Paul recognizes Note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of This doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are Actually Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he After he fell he would have to toil over the The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual That is why we are dependent totally on God what a vunerable and glorious position to be We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom just like anyone but I can well imagine Paul preferring to see people in long term committed Christian relationships than As with work which Genesis suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either I think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love with each I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this It's like saying How should I kill myself with gun or aresenic What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat or all of them What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them In all these cases the more people or animals one sleeps with the higher the chance that they will get a But this only deals with physical aspects of the Whichever sin is commited it all leads to spiritual actions are the When Christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual Second isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having loving relationships There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual btw I am one who believes in refraining from making Also where do you get that tax collectors are That's certainly not Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his Link I'm reluctant to comment in this in Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly As I indicated in the article whatever the ambiguities of various words and I still think they are significant it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the I'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the Since you disagree with my starting point obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and Sometimes discussion is still I've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Obviously they don't agree with him but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he But I don't see much sign for hope In there's an axiom that by the time Hitler's name is invoked all hope for sensible discussion is On this subject when sleeping with goats is invoked I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth clh
