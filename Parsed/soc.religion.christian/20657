From REXLEX Subject Re Certainty and Arrogance In article A Dr Nancy's Sweetie writes There is no way out of the Oh contrer mon captitan There is a Certainly it is not by human Certainly it is not by human and yet it is both To paraphrase Sartre the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a Your logic comes to fruition in At the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is Ludwig Wittgenstein Ah now it is Ludwig was a desciple of Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary Both revolve around Tractatus Logico Philosphicus ' and Philosophical Investigation ' Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought ordinary language is an invaluable resource offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily However though its formal features remain the same its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to On Witt's own account there is a dynamic fluidity of It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a vonWrights's comment that Witt's sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of On the surface Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without At the same time we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of Philosophy then through more perspicacious speech seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already Yes The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by Perfect language does not exist for fallen man therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God yet so full of unlieing depth of He viewed Christ from the OT concept of as a man thinketh so he John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside that is the consciousness of And so must Words are only vehicals of He is The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is THere are absolutes and they too are However they are only knowable when He reveals them to the There is and we shouldn't shy from this a mysticism to Paul in ROm says there are men in the There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit the Spirit of Truth and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth but there is the THe one who not only has the Spirit but that the Spirit has him Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and There is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to I would know the words which He would answer me and understand what He would say unto Job Rex suggested easy reading about epistimology He is there and He is not Silent by Francis
