From topcat Tom Albrecht Subject Re Revelations Phil Launchbury writes The apostate church of Revelation most likely refers to the st century Jews who rejected their Messiah and had Him crucified John refers to them I'm afraid not It refers to the church that Christ founded Many, many times he warns that the church will fall away into heresy as do the apostles For an example look at the parables in Matthew They refer to 'the kingdom of heaven' the church and the process of how they will be corrupted Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew parables is nonsense I e , 'yeast' ALWAYS stands for sin corruption heresy For example 'beware of the yeast of the Pharisees' Matthew explains that by leaven of the Pharisees Jesus was simply referring to their teaching not sin corruption heresy Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that the gates of hell would not prevail against His church Tom Albrecht
