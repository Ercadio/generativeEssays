From Scott A Mayo Subject Re proof of resurection James Sledd writes Finally There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ except in our spirits communion with his and the Father' It is a matter of FAITH belief without logical Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for rational western man myself I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection's I beleive but I wanted to point out the weakness of logical Terms are being used in a loaded way Logical proof is an extremely messy thing to apply to real If you think otherwise try to construct a proof that yesterday Obviously it did anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it But proof A proof starts with axioms and goes You need axioms to talk about logical You can say that you remember yesterday and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole To talk about proofs of historical events you have to relax the terms a You can show evidences not Evidences of the resurrected Jesus Proofs do I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever I also think that this will not happen as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind
