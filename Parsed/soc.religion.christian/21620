From D Andrew Kille Subject Re SOC RELIGION CHRISTIAN Anni Dozier wrote After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts months, it has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with Liberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests Someone might think to change the name to soc religion any or perhaps even soc religion new It might seem to be more appropriate Heck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted for Bill Clinton I'm on your side Since when did conservative, protestant, old time religion believers get an exclusive francise to christianity Christianity is, and always has been, a diverse and contentious tradition, and this group reflects that diversity I, fo one, am not ready to concede to any group be they liberal or conservative , catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic or not the right to claim that they have the truth , and everyone else is not christian
