From Michael Covington Subject Re Homosexuality issues in Christianity In article M writes i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent rather than completely learned this means that to a certain extent or to a great extent homosexuals cannot choose how to feel But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we all have defective appetites due to original sin Not just homosexuals, but everybody Thus we are not entitled to indulge in whatever behavior our bodies want us to I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual behavior which is wrong and homosexual orientation which is not a sin, merely a misfortune Please NO EMAIL REPLIES Respond in this public forum Michael A Covington, Associate Research Scientist Artificial Intelligence Programs The University of Georgia phone Athens, Georgia U S A amateur radio N TMI
