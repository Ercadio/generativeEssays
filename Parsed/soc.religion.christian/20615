From Virgilio Dean Velasco Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In article A Carol Alvin writes Virgilio Dean Velasco writes In article A Carol Alvin writes Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and which truths are The answer to both questions is Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute To me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations True in every instance Do you agree with this definition I think you do Similarly all truth is Indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in When is something absolute When it is always Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in Yes I do agree with your My use of the term always is rather deceptive I A simple example In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in Now this is By your definition this is truth and therefore Hold I said that all of scripture is However discerning exactly what Jesus Paul and company were trying to say is not always so I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that Rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from For instance it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for However this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on Yes my Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute And there are plenty of other Can you reconcile this The Bible preaches absolute However exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of As I said the Bible does preach absolute Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear at least to evangelicals Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone should baptism be by full immersion or not etc That is largely because sometimes it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a This is where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is God revealed his Truths to the world through His It is utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate Practically anything can be misinterpreted especially when it comes to matters of right and Care to deny that Virgilio Dean Velasco Jr Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics CWRU graduate student roboticist in training and Q wannabee Bullwinkle that man's intimidating a referee My boss is a Not very He doesn't look like one at all Jewish
