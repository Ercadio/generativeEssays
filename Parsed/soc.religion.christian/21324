From Steve Lang Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In article M you wrote The genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding not by logical argument but by The scientific method is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it as a working theory and move This method is suitable only for the study of objects without will objects which do not take an interest in the Science does not progress via experimentation but by One aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking The arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of science make that the scientific method is the only method of serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the It is Its further arrogance is the assumption which arises that since science is the only valid method of thought everything which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific method can study and that if the scientific method cannot study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be Anything which affects the physical world can be For example since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which affects our behaviour can be Science does not make any claims about the existence or non existence of objects which do not affect the physical Since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain sloppy The purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and the model which realises on the minimal number of At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a spiritual As the non spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this cannot be said of Steve Lang SLANG SLING SLINK SLICK SLACK SHACK SHANK THANK THINK THICK
