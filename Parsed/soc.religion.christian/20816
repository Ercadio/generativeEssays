From Michael C Davis Subject Re When are two people married in God's eyes Robert Anderson wrote I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in God's eyes Some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective qualifier they are married joined in God's The way I read Scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically married when they first have sexual the end of Genesis quoted from memory for this reason a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh'' Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage If you read through Genesis in particular you will often come across the phraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife'' This implies that she became his wife when they lay together at the point of Compare this with Jewish tradition Joseph when he heard that Mary was pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly but Mary and Joseph were betrothed not they were in a binding relationship which required a divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed Compare with Christ and the Church Ephesians Revelation the church is described as the bride'' of Christ but the marriage of the Lamb takes place when Jesus we are in a binding love relationship with Jesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and In summary engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship but it is not A civil ceremony is not marriage Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony ours was great I don't mean to be too Historically I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony a marriage recognised by the state has only been around in the West since Napoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although I'm ready to be corrected on that point This view obviously raises some questions What about those who have had sex with one or more partners without considering Are those people also married'' If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state I would say Yes because this honours the laws of our nations in the Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries I believe that it is God honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our Its to do with our being salt and light and also to do with how people will perceive us it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil Michael Davis And hast thou slain the Jabberwock Come to my arms my beamish boy
