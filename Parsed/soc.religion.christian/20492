From Leonard Lauria Subject Re Prayer in Jesus' Name Scott Munns writes I am doing a dormitory bible discussion with my Christian roommate and of the non Christian guys on my They are very close to accepting Christ so we have started to disciple them treat them like baby believers and go into more indepth subjects than the parables Our first discussion was on Eventually we got around to how we should pray in Jesus' Then an excellent question came up one that I don't have a real answer The question was If we need to pray in Jesus' name what about the people before Jesus They prayed to God and he listened then in spite of their Why can't it be the same way now I'll take a try at From the discussions I have been in and from how I have interpreted the bible I feel that one can pray either BUT remember this before Jesus the people talked to God no other way and he talked audible and dreams Today we have the bible to know Gods will and we have his son you died for He was given as our savior and while we still do things according to Gods will we pray THROUGH his In the bible it says that if we are not known to Jesus we are not known to sorry I do not have the verses with me So if we are to be granted eternal life we must present ourselves to Jesus first who will then present us to Leonard This space intentionally left
