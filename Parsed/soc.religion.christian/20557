From Malcusco Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In article A Pixie writes In article A Pardon me a humble atheist but exactly what is the difference between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary as an absolute truth fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance They sound like one and the same to Pixie If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow it blindly Why do we follow God so blindly Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog The answer is quite simple the dog can see and the blind person I acknowledge as a Christian that I am I see but I see illusions as well as Watched TV lately I hear but I hear lies as well as Listen to your radio or read a Remember all that tastes well is not So I rely one the one who can see hear and taste everything and knows what is real and what is That is Of course you may ask if I cannot trust my own senses how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a That is why we need faith to be We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth and loves us enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think we Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world I also do trust my experiences to some When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience because it is what my Father commands me to do and I see the results in the long term I find that He has led me in the proper direction even though it did not feel right at the This is where our works as Christians are important As exercises of the body make the body strong excercises of faith make the faith As for you no one can convert You must choose to follow God of your own will if you are ever to follow All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from If you reject that we have to accept your decision although we always keep the offer open to If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe I can only suggest you try praying for faith reading the Bible and asking Christians about their experiences Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do in defiance of the logic of this May the Lord bring peace to you Malcusco
