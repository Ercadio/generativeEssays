From Darius Lecointe Subject Re Sabbath Admissions Someone sent me this FAQ by E mail and I post my response I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven't seen clh Christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan Brothers and Sisters Being new to the faith and examining the Decalogue closely I've noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the Sabbath It states the day Saturday is the Sabbath while most Christian religions keep or atleast go to church on What's up This is a frequently asked Every time it arises it causes months of So let me see if I can answer you Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a specific covenanent with the Most of us aren't Jews so we aren't part of that There was an argument early in Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to Gentiles who became You can see the account of this debate in Acts The main question there was circumcision but keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as The apostles concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Rom notes that where no law is there is no Not only did sin exist before Sinai Eden but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai Ex The problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever He says to do we will That is why the new covenant is based on better promises Rather than do away with the law God promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts Including the Sabbath in the Acts is selective The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law Gal Israel stands for God's people of all That is why God grafted the Gentiles Roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of God and the promises belong to In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough For they are not all Israel which are of Israel v Then in Gal he says if ye be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the All Christians are Abraham's seed Jews Not physically for that is not the criterion but We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected from the Jews and the things he expects from After all it's the same However there are several ways of dealing with These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments into moral and ceremonial Ceremonial commandments apply only to the They are part of the specific Mosaic These are thinsg like the kosher laws and Moral laws apply to Most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the I believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral Thus Christians are free to choose the specific time we People would probably agree but they are How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws You are not free to choose your time of Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun Would you rather give up a day which God blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see Sabbath Admissions in study A more radical approach which is generally connected with John Calvin and the Reformed tradition says that the Law as a whole is no longer Instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by Portions of the OT Law are still useful as But they are not properly speaking legally binding on In practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral While we may no longer be under Law as sinners it's not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide We're too good at self justification for that to be Thus Christians do have moral guidance from things like Jesus' teachings Paul's advice These may not be precisely a Law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is I do not care what Calvin or any theologian My guide is what God If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment which is the only one God thought was important enough to say REMEMBER If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of If a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do I walk out of the court saying I can now go on speeding for I am now under grace Being under grace I now drive within the speed Paul adds to it in Di we then make void the law through faith God forbid yea we establish the Wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good In both analyses the specific day is not an As a matter of tradition we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's There's some debate about what Acts shows about early Christian The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath but that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held Act shows worship on the first day Sunday and I Cor also implies gatherings on that There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to worship on the Sabbath Saturday The best known are the Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's They argue that Act is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see Paul off and that I Cor doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship Do you prefer implication to fact A careful study of the Acts shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to In ICor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's See Rom Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like One person sees a specific day as mandated by God while another does He who observes that specific day does it in honor of the He who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship Note however Col which says something similar but It explicitly mentions These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the Sabbath day of the moral There are some differences among Christians about use of the word Sabbath Originally the term referred to the Day the Jewish day of Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday the day of Christian They do this largely so that they can apply the or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to Reformed tradition does not do It distinguishes between the Sabbath which is the observance mandated for Jews and the Lord's Day which is the free Christian The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev There are also differences about laws regarding this Many Christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in The more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish Sabbath which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the Lord's Why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for Jesus died because the law could not be Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the Penalties for law breaking means the law is That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial It will always be a sin to make false gods to violate God's name to break the Sabbath to steal to kill Except it you But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of Darius It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom is probably all that needs to be I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the I just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first As I indicated there are responses on both of the passages The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every Sunday for worship We get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this Act describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in Obviously the temple worship is on the Acts is an example of Christians participating in Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their Acts despite Darius' confusion is described by Acts as occuring on I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the Biblical text is clear about what was The wording implies to me that this was a normal It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread Paul talked about his upcoming But that's just not explicit enough to be really Similarly with Cor It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes I can't disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship clh
