From Len Howard Subject Re Question from an agnostic Hi Damon No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept you always have to start with one of two premises creation from nothing or creation from There are no other And if we accept one or the other of those two premises then again there are two alternatives either creation was random or was according to some If it was random I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a I call that intelligence I also prefer the Creatio ex nihilo rather than from chaos as it is There is obviously no way to prove either or We are and we must have come from Choose whatever explanation you feel most comfortable with You are the one who has to live with your Shalom Len Howard
