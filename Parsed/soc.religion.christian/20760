From Subject Re Doing the work of God Desiree Bradley Desiree B asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God's work in I've refrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would But at this point I feel I have to say Many things about this posting bother I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Christ died to break down these In him there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor If Moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we don't kill Furthermore the attack is between states not There are Christians being attacked as One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together The precedents being suggested are from the There are in fact two different things being alluded The first is from the entry into For that to be a parallel we would need for God to have promised this land through a And we would need the war to be a holy There were tight constraints on behavior in those Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be Rape would not have been While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites and that once that was done even when deception was involved they were expected to honor In contrast there have been many violations of agreement in this I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy The other OT parallel is from later when Israel was defeated by Assyria and The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's Yes even bad things may be used by God for That includes actions of bad But that doesn't justify If you read the prophets you find them very clear that in attacking Israel the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as unintentional agents of Their intent was to attack God's people and they would be judged for The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their Furthermore we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God explicitly interpreted that case through his As far as I know he did not send any prophets to While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting I am sure God will eventually make good come out of But that doesn't justify it and it won't save the people who are doing it from I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the West and Moslem oriented What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that Christians think it's OK to kill The implications for the mid East and even relations with American Moslems could be quite
