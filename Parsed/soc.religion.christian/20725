From Stanley Toney Subject Re Am I going to Hell In article A Timothy J Brent writes I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist but definitely do not believe in the christian The recent discussion about atheists and hell combined with a post to another group to the effect of 'you will all go to hell' has me interested in the consensus as to how a god might judge As a catholic I was told that a jew buddhist might go to heaven but obviously some people do not believe Even more see atheists and pagans I assume I would be lumped into this category to be I know you believe only god can judge and I do not ask you to just for your excellent question i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory as we can not understand the mind of but to attempt to answer you GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he intends to judge the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god the bible calls this for those who die before the end of the world have already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this however there is no plus and minus system for he has declared that he can not tolerate spiritual imperfection thus he can only based your worthiness to live with him on the wrong in your Good people yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD The Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's the proscribed punishment for sin is death just as the proscribed punishment for robbery is time in God then cannot ask for anything but punishement for those He does not want to the Bible says in John that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that through him it might be when i realize that i have sinned and i do with painful regularity i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin against me i have that right and privlige only because of as for Jews they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come and dis come in Jesus of Muslims i fear have been given a lie from the fater of lies They need Christ as do us for those who don't have that right in the view of the bible they stand olone in their are you going to hell i can not answer that for i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to Hell that step is much more stan toney my opinions are my own you may borrow them stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as well he listens
