From Dr Nancy's Sweetie Subject Re Certainty and Arrogance In an earlier article I explained that what many people find arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and That is many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably In short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are So long as your own brain is involved there is a possibility for I summarised the problem by writing There is no way out of the Someone called REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre ramble about Wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to As I have explained to him before you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike REXLEX' wrote I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to However as any first year philosophy student can explain what REXLEX' has written does not constitute a All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute There were two sentences in REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand There is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through I have for example direct experience of adding I don't claim to be infallible at it in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about However once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier That was the point of the earlier Human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a But how far does that get you Once God's revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error For example let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper and that Jesus said exactly This is my We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely What can we be certain of Not At the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error Did he mean that literally or not We do not have any record that he elaborated on the Was he thinking of Tran or Con substatiation He didn't We interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw But we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us This is something that most of us have direct experience Why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions So given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that Jesus said This is my Beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed we get into Unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they cannot be That is the problem of seeming The non Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know They do not believe we are infallible any more than we When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non Christians around us rarely believe that implicit Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only very confident For example we might say that we know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly But other things whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra Biblical thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are very confident of them and be ready to explain our But so far as I am aware none of us is infallible speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not Silent by Francis I didn't think very highly of it but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Somebody else might like it though so don't let my opinion stop you from reading If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On Certainty by Ludwig Darren F Provine If any substantial number of readers read some Wittgenstein of the postings would If they understood some Wittgenstein would Michael L Siemon
