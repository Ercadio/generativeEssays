From Dan Schaertel,,, Subject Re War should Christians fight In article , David A Sjoen writes Personally, I think that Christians shouldn't fight As Christians, we are not supposed to defend ourselves Matt , Heb War is a result of sin Defense may be a necessary reaction to an attack, but I don't think that we as Christians should take part in this What if you are trying to defend someone else Should you allow killing and oppression to continiue, or is it our obligation to protect the innocent
