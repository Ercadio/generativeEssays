From Melinda Hsu Subject Re The arrogance of Christians I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of Christians and look forward to any In my encounters with Christians I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total According to them their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth thus they know the This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other Their way is the ' ' But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular That choice is part faith and part reason but it seems to me a My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school A kid would say All policemen are jerks I'd ask How do you know Because my daddy told me so How do you know you're daddy is right He says he's always right Well the argument usually stops right In the end aren't we all just kids groping for the truth If so do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false This is only my third time browsing through this I apologize if I'm covering tired old Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any Louis Kim O PH Southwest Research Institute ' FAX Post Office Drawer San Antonio TX I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it or that there's just as good evidence for other I don't agree but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence But that doesn't seem to be your Rather you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian It sounds more like an existentialist view where people choose what value to follow but there's no actual independent spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense This sort of model with modifications of one sort or another may be appropriate for some But Christianity is in its essense a historical That is it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways and that we see evidence of that in In the mundane world we are not free to choose how things When we drop something it falls aside from well defined situations where it doesn't The Christian concept is that spiritual matters there is also an actual external I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect But while we may not think we know everything we are confident that we know some And that implies that we think things that contradict them are I don't see how else we could This needn't result in I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other They may have things to teach me and even if they don't I respect them as fellow human But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are Maybe even disasterously clh
