>is raped considered not to have been abstaining? i no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something
like "no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area immediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the
vagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva". that is, abstinence wasn't discussed as "sex outside of marriage is
morally wrong" but as keep the sperm away from the ovum and conception is impossible. the moral question i recall the teacher asking was,
"is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent
yet?" -jen -- #include <stdisclaimer> // // msdos testing
