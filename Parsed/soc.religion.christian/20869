From James Sledd Subject Afterlife Here is another way of looking at When we die we are released from the arc of time and able to comprehend our lives in To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had have will have in this From that perspective I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal That having lived a life of grace will be an eternal That the resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant As an Aside If we were to be restricted for all time to our present form would you opt for immortality James Sledd think in n dimensions listen for the voice of God
