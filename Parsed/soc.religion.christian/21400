From Michael Walker Subject Re Deuterocanonicals Sirach David Wagner writes The deutero canonical books were added much later in the church's They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately David Wagner a confessional Lutheran Now thank we all our God Whoah whoah whoah WHOAH What That last paragraph just about killed The Deuterocanonicals have ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to REMOVE certain books not the fact that the Catholic Church decided to add some much later that is the reason for the difference between Catholic and Protestant Sorry for the tone but that comment really irked Mike Walker of Illinois
