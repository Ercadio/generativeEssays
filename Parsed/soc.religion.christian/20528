From Aaron Bryce Cardenas Subject Re christians and aids Paul Conditt writes Yes it's important to realize that all actions have consequences and that rules were made for our own But to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too text deleted Yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a punishment for certain types of sin this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution' I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his God doesn't cause curses he warns us of Kevin Davis wrote a while ago Last week I was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with To even suggest that AIDS is deserved is The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death which is much worse than AIDS we have all hurt God with our Paul Conditt reveals his feelings In case you couldn't tell I get extremely angry and upset when I see things like Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is They still need The first issue you bring up is your It is obvious ly wrong to be angry Gal for any reason especially extremely angry which is on par with Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive them Father they know not what they Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Please don't give in to anger it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad It's okay if you read something that bothers you but you need to address it in a loving If right now I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other is God's punishment for people who have committed certain God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to We will all be judged after we die but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts believing the gospel's testimony repenting of our sin confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism and living a new life for Let us not judge someone to be eternally God's arm is not to short to He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled He works for the good of all Even through the worst of situations he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with Fortunately what you describe as seeing is actually You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions but please try to be open You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence The important point to be made however is that not listening to God's commands or advice or warnings sinning causes harm or misfortune to yourself and For this reason a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS which can be transmitted in sinful ways is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or I hope that you are feeling better now Love Aaron Cardenas
