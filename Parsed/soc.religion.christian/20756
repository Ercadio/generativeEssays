From Peter White Subject Some questions from a new Christian Reply To In article A Steven R Hoskins writes I have another question I would like to I am not yet affiliated with any one Aside from matters of taste what criteria should one use in choosing a church I don't really know the difference between the various Protestant Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking off they go to another I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the church choosing process It seems to me from that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants So I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ the church they go to is a logical first You have been born into the family of People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to If you met the Lord on your own so to speak there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for Here you are more like an Prayerfully go and leave yourself on a few doorsteps and see if anyplace feels like I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people but on the other hand there are no perfect If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment you will spread that wherever you In general I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that Peter White disclaimer None of what is written necessarily reflects a view of my Phil I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in NIV his sufferings becoming like him in his death
