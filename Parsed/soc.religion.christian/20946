From REXLEX Subject Re Certainty and Arrogance In article A Dr Nancy's Sweetie writes Someone called REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre ramble about Wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to I will answer this as I find REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not Silent by Francis I didn't think very highly of it but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Somebody else might like it though so don't let my opinion stop you from reading If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On Certainty by Ludwig Darren F Provine If any substantial number of readers read some Wittgenstein of the postings would If they understood some Wittgenstein would Michael L Siemon Notice what I said about this I called it Easy The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon' I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay That was who he was writting I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to I've talked with Schaeffer one on I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian ND alone would fill both those catagories His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re think what their question I saw this time and time again at different open So yes Schaeffers books are by in large well It certainly isn't grad level But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another Also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt Look the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine But we must add a qualification to give this Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its We never know the value of a thing until we know its Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not Christian faith which leads to If we forget the limits of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life More without limits is less less with limits is Or as I have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form w o Let's put it another The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with Think about It can tell the difference between the two if you will let Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very little When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his This is where the principle of suspended judgment At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God it must suspend judgment and say Father I do not understand you but I trust Now don't read all your objections of me into that I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all but I trust you It means that I do not understand You in this situation but I do understand why I trust You anyway Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of the principle of suspended judgment is not It is not a leap of faith but a walk of As believers we cannot always know why but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the Now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent whying of a year It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other leads to genuine More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to If we do not know why we trust God then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust Failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to If on the other hand we do know why we trust God we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall For what God is doing may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory It may be mystery to us but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is And that my friend was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in Rex
