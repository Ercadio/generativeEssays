From vera shanti noyes Subject Re Homosexuality issues in Christianity In article M Ann Carlson writes bible verses used homosexuality deleted Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should check out Dignity Integrity More Light Presbyterian churches Affirmation MCC churches Meet some gay Christians find out who they are pray with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your also check out the episcopal church although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women there certainly is a fairly large percentage in my experience who i am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous homosexual this in no way diminishes his ability to minister in fact he has a very significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his community as well as a very significant aids my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel God thinks about obviously my conclusions may be wrong nonetheless they are my own and they feel right to i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent rather than completely this means that to a certain extent or to a great extent homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about other people which is why reports of curing homosexuals always chill me and make me feel please not that although i can't cite sources where you can find this information there is homosexual behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals which is in itself suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned or at least that the word unnatural shouldn't really please remember that whatever you believe gays and lesbians shoul not be excluded from your love and christ loved us all and we ALL and he himself never said anything against homosexuals rather it is paul who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as women shouldn't speak in church and women should keep their heads covered in church not exact quotations as i don't have my bible handy who says these i have a tendency to take some of the things paul says with a grain of well that's all i'll say for Ann Carlson O MS o NASA Langley Research Center Hampton VA vera noyes the lord is risen let's party noye midway vera noyes
