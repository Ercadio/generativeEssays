From a Rose arose Subject Re The arrogance of Christians writes Arrogance is It is not the result of religion it is the result of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show others of one's I assume that God decided to be judge for our sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the judge we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged I'm not sure I agree with this I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's superior knowledge rightness or holiness over another person's I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's religion is better than other These are all naturally self implied It is self contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be Were I to find myself in error my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be Therefore I must always consider my beliefs That's not That's unavoidable It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than my Were his or her god greater wouldn't I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another No doubt many will have to chew on this one Were passive observation of one's superior points arrogance then God would be most arrogant of Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in our People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another I'm not very I'm I'm not good I'm just a worm in the I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin I really cannot help Were this person truely humble he would take a different God thank you for making me the way you I know that you never do anything second Yet with all that you have given me I have been so You've given me power to resist the I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing Lord with all you've given me I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your And yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save As terribly evil as I am I deserve to go straight to hell yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've Lord please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of Lord I'm so sorry for my Please help me to I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because they don't want to be If I find someone arrogant I typically don't have anything to do with For me I've often found it hard to tell the Often times the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud worm in the ground false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness I certainly don't feel like being confronted by my Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to At the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I However were someone to confront me silently by their example earn my respect and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one's ability to serve It's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation in our lives But we should examine ourselves I hope I typed this back in right and why we react to certain situations with such For instance many of us feel justified to be insulted by an arrogant As if we needed a reason to feel But after being insulted over and over again by the words of others you'd think we'd either toughen up or decide not to be insulted or ignore the Just because you can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage that doesn't make that reaction the appropriate It is in this light of self examination that we can change our emotional Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our The devil is the accuser of the He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self righteous where we are indeed The devil's aim is to get us into as much misery as he Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting those that the Father loves so I deplore the horrible crime of child We want prevention not merely We must reach the root of the It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful No mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the Susan Anthony The Revolution July
