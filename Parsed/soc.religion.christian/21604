From Rich Wales Subject Re Mormons and eternal marriage was Re Mormon Temples David Hammerslag asked How do you Mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less one of the following three positions Jesus was talking to a group of people Sadducees who were trying to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection something they didn't believe in These people and those associated with them Now there were with us seven brethren would not be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal Hence the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni ties but that doesn't mean other more faithful people could not have this Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of being married and the process of becoming The latter activity marrying and giving in marriage will not take place in the eternities because all eternal marriages will be taken care of before The account as we have it in all three of the synoptic Gospels is missing something that would make its real meaning Note that we LDS do not believe in Biblical inerrancy so we do not in general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter day proph Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question was not significantly revised in the Joseph Smith Translation or Inspired Version of the Bible since we do not believe this work was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the Rich Wales Mortice Kern Systems MKS King Waterloo Ontario Canada
