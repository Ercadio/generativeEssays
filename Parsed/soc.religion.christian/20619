From Michael Covington Subject Clarification Easter In response to a lot of email I've gotten, I need to clarify my position I am not in favor of paganism I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non Christian aspects of Easter as presently celebrated Incidentally, Easter eggs are not non Christian they are a way of ending the Lenten fast My point was to distinguish between intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but nowadays is not understood or intended as such Many people who are doing are being accused of It would be illogical to claim that one is really worshipping a pagan deity without knowing it Worship is a matter of intention One cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so Michael A Covington, Associate Research Scientist Artificial Intelligence Programs The University of Georgia phone Athens, Georgia U S A amateur radio N TMI
