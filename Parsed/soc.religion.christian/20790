From Andrew Byler Subject Re Serbian genocide Work of God Andrew Kille writes Are you suggesting that God supports genocide Perhaps the Germans were punishing Jews on God's behalf Any God who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God Romans And furthermore God foreknows everything that would It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing However though they are doing evil and we should not cooperate with them when they do such it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is In short the slaughter in Bosnia though deplorable in the eyes of God maybe then again they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins Onan in the Old Testmament for example and Annias and Spahira in the New is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be But don't forget it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of Let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd in And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon which got Israel which was inturn gotten by Persia God does use nations to punish other nations as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel Mene mene tekel peres Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice found severly wanting and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites ordered by God as the task of The Cannanites had been given their chance found severly wanting and the Great Judge carried out His just sentence I could go on with more examples but I see little need to do so as my point is quite Two things need to be remembered at all It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He In His divine Wisdom He made the world as was best in His eyes and like Paul says in Romans the clay is not one to tlak back to the The message of Jesus Christ is as follows Repent now for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly dallying Let the dead bury the dead come follow There is not an infinite amount of time rather Christ is passing by right now calling people to follow Him and become fishers of He does not say well alright you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your He said Follow His message is NOT I'm just a sweety pie who would never hurt a fly you've got all the time in the world and Divine Judgement that's only a fairy Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ Titus is also the just and righteous Judge of the And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or Andrew Byler Does not He who ways the heart perceive sin and will He not judge men according to their works Proverbs
