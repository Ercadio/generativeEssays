From David Wagner Subject Re Certainty and Arrogance Darren Dr Nancy's Sweetie writes Darren In an earlier article I explained that what many people find Darren arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess Darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and and Darren In short the problem is that no matter how good your sources Darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own Darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran While reason is a gift from God it is also infected by Yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither I think does We need reason as Darren himself has pointed out to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the We need first and foremost For the sinful mind is hostile to It does not submit to God's law nor can it do so Romans Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation Sola Scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that Yet Luther also said regarding baptism But mad reason rushes forth and because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as Large Catechism Fourth part Baptism To make matters more complicated Luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist' I've seen him described as a take no prisoners' We might conclude given these observations that Luther was inconsistent or And surely at least some have come to that But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther or others as Rather we should imitate the Bereans who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true Acts The basis for the confidence with which Luther Peter Paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the Holy This is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that guides informs and uses The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it God does not want us to preach the message that I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead but rather I know that my redeemer lives Job The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying What is truth but rather follows Christ who said In fact for this reason I was born and for this I came into the world to testify to the Everyone on the side of truth listens to me John We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the Jesus said If you hold to my teachings you are really my Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free John The Proverbs urge us Buy the truth and do not sell Pr The Psalmist prayed Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth Ps Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth' Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture revealed by the Spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture as Luther did then we are not arrogant but We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of REXLEX It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be REXLEX absolute about a Darren But how far does that get you Once God's revelation stops Darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture and the products of our own reason even when such reasoning is based on However I think I would draw the line of distinction more reasonably' and less academically' than you Darren For example let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper Darren and that Jesus said exactly This is my Darren We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren absolutely What can we be certain of Not Darren At the moment he stops speaking and people start Darren interpreting the possibility of error Did he mean Darren that literally or not We do not have any record that he Darren elaborated on the Was he thinking of Tran or Con Darren substantiation He didn't Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said This is my body then that is what we should Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this We also have Paul's words in Corinthians in which he passed on to us what he received from the In particular he said For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread as well as the Lord's body as our senses in fact tell Does this prove that tran substantiation is false I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat But this thought is found nowhere in So we reject Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in side remark I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con But it has been non Lutherans who have told me We tend not to use the I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare Catholic Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's But almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the end side remark Darren When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we Darren are infallible the non Christians around us rarely believe Darren that implicit Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying Darren to cover them This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their It is far better to take the approach I'd like to show you what Scripture You decide for yourself whether to believe it or Darren REXLEX' suggested that people read He is There and He is Not Darren Silent by Francis I didn't think very highly of Darren it but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Darren Evangelical Somebody else might like it though Darren so don't let my opinion stop you from reading Darren If someone is interested in my opinion I'd suggest On Darren Certainty by Ludwig As long as we're trading references I'd like to suggest Siegbert Becker's paperback The Foolishness of God The place of reason in Lutheran theology published by Northwestern Publishing This book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University of David Wagner Not by might nor by power a confessional Lutheran but by my Spirit says the LORD Zechariah
