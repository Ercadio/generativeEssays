From Darius Lecointe Subject Re Easter what's in a name was Re New Testament Double Standard Seanna Watson writes Since the day upon which most Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus is approaching I thought I would comment on this In article M Daniel Segard writes What is the objection to celebration of Easter It is celebration of the resurrection of I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate the resurrection but it is the sole and only reason that we are Christians how could we not celebrate it If it is only the name Not quite Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is Buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the So as we see from Scripture those who are of Israel will observe the Day FOREVER The Gentiles who believe in the Messiah of Israel are welcome to observe the Day as well but it is not required of them since the are adopted into the Commonwealth of The Gentiles who are grafted into the Commonwealth of Israel are only required to observe the basic commands given to those who came before Abram see also Acts No further requirements are placed upon them once they come to faith in So from this I infer that there are different rules for Christians of Jewish descent What happened to there is neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus Jewish Christians Messianics may find certain forms of worship and certain disciplines meaningful because of their cultural background but I have a hard time understanding the justification for applying rules or commandments to those who have been justified by grace through faith in Jesus Paul answered your question in Romans In he stated that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of God and the promises were given to the It is a package He goes on to identify those who are true Vs makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in then in Gal he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed and heirs to all the promises given to the The promises come with the It is all or Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden Same BTW please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis Could you list those Acts deals with circumcision and the law of Moses which was added because of transgression of God's eternal law Gal Rom Darius Lecointe I got my BA when I was Born Again Department of Educational Research And my MA when I was Made Anew Florida State University Now I'm getting my PhD as I become Tel A Patient Humble E mail
