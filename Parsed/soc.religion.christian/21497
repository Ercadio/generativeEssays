From Aaron Bryce Cardenas Subject Baptism requires Faith It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of Original This is primarily a Catholic doctrine with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant Even among its supporters however people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong However if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based then we can come to an understanding of the Let's now take a more complete look at Colossians In him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by Christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans through a personal faith in the power of Our parent's faith cannot do Do infants have faith Let's look at what the Bible has to say about Romans But not all the Israelites accepted the good For Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message ' Consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word Kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to God's Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new Ezekiel The soul who sins will The son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against If you read all of Ezekiel you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's So we can have no original guilt from Ezekiel Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted and get a new heart and a new Why will you die O house of Israel For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the Sovereign Repent and live The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and Kids cannot do Acts says that when we repent and are baptized we will then receive a new spirit the Holy Then we shall Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not Biblical let's look at some of the scriptures used to support Romans Therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned Sin and death entered the world when the first man Death came to each man because each man Note that it's good to read through all of Romans Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same Let's look at one Romans For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made Through the disobedience of each individual each was made a In the same way through the obedience of Jesus each will be made We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned not because of guilt from Otherwise the Bible would contradict I encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn't all fit Psalm Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before God in repentance for David himself was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time when he wasn't He is humbling himself before God by confessing his His saying that he was sinful at birth is a The Bible being inspired by God isn't limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus John For another example of hyperbole see Luke Now then even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not Biblical they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish not sharing toys with other children by being mean hitting others and fighting Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things but my gut feeling is always that they don't know any Let's look to see if the Bible agrees with my gut Isaiah Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about If they don't then point them to Matthew and find a new Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and We see that he did grow and become wiser in Luke and The implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over Since we know that Jesus was perfect without sin we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose the right instead of the Jesus himself was baptized albeit with John's baptism not as an infant but as a thirty year old man Luke and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized Luke Immediately afterwards he was tempted by the devil Luke Matthew Mark Thank you for your Moderator this should finish up the subject for a Perhaps you would like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes Feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to but please send me a copy of the final Sincerely Aaron Cardenas I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your First original sin is not a Catholic only It was held by Luther and Calvin as well and is still present in one form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed Second saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument which has considerable evidence against The original Baptist theology included original sin and some Baptists still hold And there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original Among Protestants the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us rather than our acceptance of In traditional Protestant theology God's grace precedes our response and is applicable to There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that God accepts even clh
