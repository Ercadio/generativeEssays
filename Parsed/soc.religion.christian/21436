From Mail Server Subject Re homosexual issues in Christianity Michael Siemon writes In M Bryan Whitsell writes Any one who thinks that Homosexuality and Christianity are compatible should check out Romans I Corinthians I Timothy Jude II Peter Lev to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these Some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse Others simply do not address the I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning Do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of And such were some of I Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God How does this apply to homosexuals I understand fornication to be sex outside of Is this an accurate definition Is there any such thing as same sex marriage in the Bible My understanding has always been that the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his I am however willing to listen to Scriptural evidence to the You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it it is a I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual I know of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn or even mention intercourse with Do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a perversion and if so why That is what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful Could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently Can one be a Christian zoophile By the way I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful so please understand that I am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow people of alternative orientations I do believe however that one should read the Bible with an attitude of what is the Bible trying to say and not what do I WANT the Bible to I choose not to give in to my perverted sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me whether I like it or not that such things are It is frustrating at times and I have had days where it really got me down but I don't blame God for this I blame the sin Mark There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual That doesn't meant that I think all the Biblical evidence vanishes but the nature of the evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve I think your argument from fornication is Why is homosexuality wrong Because it's Why is it fornication Because they're not Why aren't they married Because the church refuses to do a marriage Why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony Because homosexuality is In order to break the circle there's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is clh
