From Paul Conditt Subject Re christians and aids In article A Mark Ashley writes In article A Kevin Davis writes Many Christians believe in abstinence but in a moment will be overcome by We all compromise and rationalize poor choices sin Last week I was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with To even suggest that AIDS is deserved is Some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid to know Yet eventually man But only after getting a lesson from Yes it's important to realize that all actions have consequences and that rules were made for our own But to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying would any of us have mouths left What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something I dare say all of us would be walking into I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didn't get involved in deviant sexual Certainly people who received tainted blood are not to But it just goes to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a Yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God not because of If AIDS or any other STD is a punishment for sexual sin what do we do with diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle In addition IMHO forgiveness is not the end of There is still the matter of Is it AIDS I don't Atonement is extremely important but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST This is the central message of the A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins and was made in the Lamb of His sacrifice atoned for all of our sins past present and God does not require pennance for our sins nor does he require us to come up with our own He has graciously already done that for To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus In case you couldn't tell I get extremely angry and upset when I see things like Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is They still need Jesus Christ no more and no less than we I've said this before but I think it's a good People with AIDS are modern day Jesus healed many He can also heal people with AIDS maybe not on this earth but in an ultimate My next door neighbor has She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with Her theology isn't what I would want it to be but God's grace covers The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight she's had the disease for over years and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment It seems to me that God is being glorified through her Paul Overstreet the country singer has a good song title that I think applies to all of us But for the Grace of God There Go I or something like that May we all experience and accept God's Mark Ashley DISCLAIMER The opinions expressed here are my own they do not uunet marka reflect the opinion or policies The Lost Los Angelino of Harris Paul Conditt Internet Applied Research Phone FAX Laboratories Fedex Burnet Road Austin Texas University of Texas Postal Box Austin Texas Austin Texas the most wonderful place in Texas to live TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTTTTTTTTTTTT Texas Tech Lady Raiders TT TTT TT SWC Champions TTT NCAA National Champions TTT TTTTTTT
