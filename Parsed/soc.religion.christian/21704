From David Wagner Subject Re homosexual issues in Christianity Michael Michael Siemon writes Michael The kind of interpretation I see as incredibly perverse is Michael that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket Michael equation of homosexual behavior and Since Christians Michael citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have Michael at least READ the story it amounts to slander a charge Michael that homosexuality rape to use that against and Michael It is just Michael as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it's a Michael secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent to equate Michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the Michael rape of God's Let's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story It states clearly that the visitors were But all the men from every part of the city of Sodom both young and old surrounded the They called to Lot Where are the men who came to you tonight Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with ' For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of Sodom and by Lot as men Furthermore we know from Gen that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin before the angels visited the It is clear that the grievous sin of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual It appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square which simply indicates the extremity of their It does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful as Michael would have us Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from the creation story not solely on the story of Sodom and He created us male and female and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become one This marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which God blesses and He regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his But we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men or between two Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from or expresses God's will in instituting and blessing Thus the Levitical code which was given only to the Jews forbade incest homosexuality bestiality the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor's wife other commandments forbade The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse Jude because they abandoned and or polluted the marriage Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as unnatural' Romans not because this was simply Paul's opinion but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us male and Michael Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here Michael and in every corner of USENET and the world and ALL they Michael ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously Michael have never thought about maybe never even read in TOTAL Michael ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest Michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can Michael manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they Michael suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss Michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what Michael it Really have you no better response to slander' than more slander David Wagner The day is surely drawing near a confessional Lutheran When God's Son the Annointed Shall with great majesty appear As Judge of all All mirth and laughter then shall cease When flames on flames will still increase As Scripture truly Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit Bartholomaeus Ringwaldt
