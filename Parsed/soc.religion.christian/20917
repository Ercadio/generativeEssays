my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we Across the street was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw her name in Well we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about was a period of about years we lost that was a while By the lives in Kansas and me in OK last year in one of her letters she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be So I drove about hours to see This is where it spent the whole day with of the best days of my Even though we had been writing each other we still had to get used to being in has got to be the most incredible woman I ever She's one year older than me BTW I mean no person in the world could ask for a better Not only was she incredibly beautiful not to mention WAY out of my I'm not unattractive mind you but she had a great personality and a great sence of Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their know the kind of But she knows I am a Well you get the idea of what I think of If there is ever such a thing as love at first found That was last kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since In out letters Erin and I always kid each other about not finding which is true for me but I know it can't be for her She has had some problems at home her folks split up and she ended up leaving we are at the Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last Okay now I'm going to try to explain my life to I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't College just wasn't clicking with me Greek life is really big here and that just isn't my I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me i really have no idea of what i want to do with my I was interested in something medical Physical Therpy I love working with kids but 'it' just didn't work for me at this And my parents could So I'm working full time at the Bass Store Bass shoes that is and now I have a part time job at a local I work in the infant room M W I've really enjoyed it so It spices up my week a little bit and it's great As of now I'm not planning on going back to school in the very near The main reason being my indecision on what I want to But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of Where I have no idea except for one thing it won't be to Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for about months as Assistant Manager and when that's done I'll basically be given a list of stores newly or soon to be built to chose where i would like to I've pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas hopeully close to the beach Wouldn't it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years What do you think abou that I would like to know your This job would pretty much be But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or The company is solid and treats it employees very Good benefits bonuses medical Plus after year of full time service they will reimburse I do have school money waitng for me but this will help especially since I will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever I Chris i really would like to know what you think of my I respect your I've been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really I do like my job although I'm about sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil it IS I don't think earning about a year for a year old female is too Anyway onto your career I'll solve your problem right now MARRY You can do your pilot thing I like to be by myself sometimes Seriously or not as seriously do what will make you the happiest worry about the home life OK well I'm sure you see what has got me so What do you think she meant about the marraige thing I dream at night about marrying her and then she mentions it in her letter I don't know what to think Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get what does she mean I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that I don't date beacause No time Not that much that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with the Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support and here she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to I mean what if she did move to would I do I'm only and she 'm only a Sophmore struggling through I have prayed about this over the past year from time to saying God if she is the right one let the situation open Could this be my sign I would do ANYTHING to get her to is some moree that makes it Should I call her I'm terrible over the I don't even like to talk to my friends here for longer than I mean what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me I'm really would really appreciate any help i can Thanx Chris I have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with Chris directly via clh
