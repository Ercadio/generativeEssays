From shellgate Larry Overacker Subject Re The arrogance of Christians In article A Carol Alvin writes Virgilio Dean Velasco writes In article A Carol Alvin writes Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes The answer to both questions is Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute To me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations True in every instance Do you agree with this definition I think you do Similarly all truth is Indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in When is something absolute When it is always Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in I agree with Carol Determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of And we easily forget that relative truth is in fact For example I recently was asking some children the question What temperature does water boil at I got the answer degrees I asked if they knew what scale and was told It's just Any That's what all thermometers Well that's sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply IT is NOT an absolute Similarly Scripture is full of Truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism example of head covering in Church deleted This was a good There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians and not necessarily The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth which was having a LOT of trouble with Is it Absolute Truth to me And I see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute And there are plenty of other Can you reconcile this Even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the Bible I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the Such a statement is terribly self Let me put it to you this If there are no absolutes shouldn't we conclude that the statement There are no absolutes is not absolutely true Obviously we have a contradiction I don't claim that there are no I think there are very few though and determining absolutes is I Very And even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets There is hardly consensus even in evangelical Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding Biblical So People sometimes disagree about what is This does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the I can't prove the existence of I can only rely upon MY I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the Therefore we can't comprehend the So I don't need I can never know the essence of God only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes but it is of no practical It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not Who cares It doesn't affect me in any practical useful I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on Maybe God So what Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor or God Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch This attitude leads many non Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical Christianity is true wonderful and It appeals to Reason since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex NOTE I'm NOT claiming there is no place for That'd be There IS a world of difference between authoritative and Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally Good parents like God are Many Christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this Larry Overacker Lawrence Overacker Shell Oil Company Information Center Houston TX
