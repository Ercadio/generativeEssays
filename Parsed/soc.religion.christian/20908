From Paul Harvey Subject Re Sabbath Admissions I wrote in response to Darius Lecointe It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another Rom is probably all that needs to be Was Paul a God too Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher priority than the direct word of Jesus in Paul begins Romans with If someone is weak in the faith Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the I just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the Yes but what does the Bible have to say What did Jesus say Paul closes Romans with On the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn't acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is a Gaus ISBN Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law Have you read Jesus' word in Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin Greek hamartia missing the mark However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first As I indicated there are responses on both of the passages Whereas the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in are fairly clear are they not The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every Sunday for worship We get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this doesn't answer your question what day Christians met in their Acts despite Darius' confusion is described by Acts as occuring on It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread Breaking bread roughly synonymous with So I think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship clh Or they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in actually stood for something Perhaps they were strong in the faith No I don't believe that Paul can overrule However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile The Law was regarded by Jews at the time and now as binding on Jews but not on There are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called Noachic laws but they are quite The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Thus there is no contradiction with Mat As far as I can tell both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Thus they continued to obey the The issue was and is with Gentile Christians who are not covered by the Law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it Jesus dealt mostly with I think we can reasonably assume that Mat was directed to a Jewish He did interact with Gentiles a few times the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others The terms used to describe the centurion see Luke suggest that he was a God fearer a Gentile who followed God but had not adopted the whole Jewish He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person and Jesus accepted him as This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the At least as I read Paul he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense Again this issue isn't one of the abolition of the In the middle of his discussion Paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that's not what he intends to Rather he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their But ultimately it's an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here and not everyone agrees with my But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the It still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be For its purpose of convicting of sin it's important that it not be However for Christians it's not the end ultimately we live in faith not While the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar The quoted passage from Mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus shows us how he interprets the The not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that's not Jesus' Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher Some scholars claim that Mat needs to be taken in the context of Jewish Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and Mat This and the discussion later in Mat suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of Paul's conclusion is While he talks about the Law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the He is quite concerned about maintaining moral The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Paul is embroiled in arguments about As is natural in letters responding to specific situations he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble the Law as specifically Jewish He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of On the other hand when Jesus commends the Law he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current Look at the way terms like family values take on special meaning from the current Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family values should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term Law any more than people who concerned about the family values movement are really opposed to family clh
