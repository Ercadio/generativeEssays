From Hal F Lillywhite Subject Re Mormon temples In article M Mail Server writes But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices parallel Mormon temple Could you give an example Also why do they only parallel Mormon ceremonies Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original Christian practices Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated mission If you want parallels the best source is probably the book Temple and Cosmos by Hugh It is not light reading As to why these early practices only parallel and do not exactly duplicate the modern LDS ceremony there are a couple of reasons Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces undoubtedly Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony get What we have in the day literature the Egyptian ceremonies and certain Native American ceremonies is almost certainly not exactly what Jesus Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the situation much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the audio visual tools now
