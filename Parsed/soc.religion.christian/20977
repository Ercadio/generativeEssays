From Douglas Fowler Subject Re Christian Parenting Sorry for posting this but my e mail keeps Maybe it will help others here anyway and therefore I pray others will read It is actually a response from my Aunt who has kids since I have none Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into young I am looking at the way various groups of children are raised at At the moment I am formlulating information on discipline within the Christian Please if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me your response to the following All responses will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e mail Since this aunt and uncle have kids I felt they would be more relevant than I who have none yet Ages sexes of children year old twins boy boy girl Do you spank your kids I don't call it spanking but they do so yes very If so how often I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something very dangerous such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the Maybe times for each except for the girl who has not been spanked They call it that because it does hurt their feelings and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still Do you use an implement to spank with No that would be too If it's too traumatic they never recall why they were Besides it must be immediate and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away and that lessens the It's very emotional for a child as it is which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear which hurts for perhaps seconds is called a If you do not spank what method of discipline do you use Lots of logical consequences for instance when Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out I made sure they didn't play together for days so he'd know that would make him lose friends very He's never done anything like that We also use time out in their rooms I use a timer so they don't keep arguing with me over leaving since it's hard to argue with a I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they calm down if they're too I use the top of the stairs when they're really Your age Your location Bath It's right outside of Akron in the northeast part of While under the age of did you ever commit a criminal offence No and none of my kids would dream of I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required parents use that as an excuse to hit too How ere you disciplined as a kid Lots of timeouts same as I Our family and my husband's have never used In fact my grandmother in law was one of kids and they were almost never This was around the turn of the And none of us has ever been afoul of the law man made or God's Jesus says referring to a small child whom he is holding that what ye do to the least of these ye do also to The Bible also says in all things to be kind and merciful and especially Colossians There is no room for selfish anger which I'll admit I've been tempted with at When I've felt like spanking hard in anger maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear but what I would have given would have been the devil's I could feel the temptation and just angrily ordered the kid to his her room and went to my room After praying and asking God's forgiveness I was much calmer and did not feel like spanking but felt that what I had done was enough Doug Fowler Me age now Mommys and Daddys other Ever wonder if after Casey relatives have to give lots of hugs love missed the strike in the poem support 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it big hug that lasts forever and ever
