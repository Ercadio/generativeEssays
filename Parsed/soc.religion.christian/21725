From Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Subject Hail Mary Full of Grace In article M Seanna Watson writes In article M Joseph Buehler writes referring to Mary She was immaculately conceived and so never subject to Original Sin but also never committed a personal sin in her whole This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a Was Mary fully human If it is possible for God to miraculously make a person free of original sin and free of committing sin their whole life then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus Why can't God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us sinless without the need for repentance and salvation and all that I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption or the perpetual virginity both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus but this concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the rest of Christian doctrine as I understand If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma of Mary's perpetual sinlessness then how do you interpret Luke And when the angel had come to her he said Hail full of grace the Lord is with Blessed art thou among and Luke behold henceforth all generations shall call me I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace just as some of us are but it seems to me that full of grace means just what it says filled to the brim incapable of containing The only other people we know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now another Catholic dogma based on the communion of saints as I explained in an earlier post Full of grace to me means sinless and anyone who has ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary was As a Catholic I too find certain of the dogmas tough to But that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into I pray God to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His And as you probably know faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical A Catholic by nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ a personal faith in Christ as his own personal redeemer and a community faith in the Church as the body of Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechist You might want to check the full of grace translates a single word that simply means favored or perhaps more literally graced The full is a vestige of the specific translation you're clh
