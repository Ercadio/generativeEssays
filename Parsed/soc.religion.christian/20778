From Petri Pihko Subject Re Atheist's views on Christianity was Re Accepting Jeesus in your First I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my In my follow up to Jason Smith's posting I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding Jason Smith wrote In article A Petri Pihko writes I also concede that I was doubly remiss as I asserted No reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in Am I mistaken with this understanding Yes to some There was an excellent discussion in on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago I hope it did not escape your The correct word is 'likely' There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely Theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical However theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of It is extremely important to test whether theories can predict something new or not yet All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection It does not mean they must be correct but they are not mere 'best fits' for the But if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an All of which require something we Christians readily admit to Faith'' Well yes if you want to believe in This is not what science requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your Disbelievers are not The fact that there are several candidates belies that none are With out conclusive evidence we are left with This is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in anything My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist someone who is unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in Yes I know that one can't believe without God's help Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to I'm afraid this does not change my a couple of paragraphs Summary we ask Why does the universe exist I think this question should actually be split into two parts namely Why is there existence Why anything exists and How did the universe emerge from nothing deletions The question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence Actually both questions turn out to be devoid of Things that exist do and things that don't exist don't Tautology at its Carefully examine the original question and then the counter question The first asks Why while the second is a request for No it is not although it does look like This is a true dichotomy either something exists or nothing If nothing exists nobody would ask If something exists it is possible to ask why but actually no existing being could give an Imagine for a moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask Why nothing exists This is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness Now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness This is what I meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous I might add the worldview of Things that exist do and things that don' 't is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist's belief in It is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a I do indeed think there probably is no reason for being or existence in general for reasons I stated However they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come Science cannot give reasons for any particular human being's We come to Either I am therefore I or I am for a This is a deep philosophical question is determinism true or not Also is God deterministic or not I tend to think this question has no meaning in His If I am for a reason I've yet failed to see what it would From our perspective it looks like 'I' exist for truly random I just rolled two dice why did I get and How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence If the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a If the latter your search is just Yes I am satisfied with this reason until I find something My years of Christianity were of no help in this respect I have to admit but I am Another answer is that God is the source of all This sounds much better but I am tempted to ask Does God Himself exist then If God is the source of His own existence it can only mean that He has in terms of human time always But this is not the same as the source of all This does not preclude His It only seeks to identify His qualities implying He exists to have qualities BTW No it doesn't but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists for an answer to this question is not Of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in His I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why It appears that Pihko agrees as we shall see But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the Asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an It is impossible to know unknowable However the question why do I exist in particular is not an invalid question this is not what I But from our perspective it is impossible to tell and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since I found I was deluding My I was using why as why did this come to be Why did pre existence become Why did pre spacetime become I think pre existence is an There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never It exists only for those who are inside But we come to the admission that science fails to answer Why Because it can't be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid The validity of the question has to be discussed separately I think philosophy is of great help What can be known and what is not knowable Pihko does present a good point We may need to ask What do I as an individual Christian base my faith on Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God said and continues to say in his Word This is a very good In trying to answer this and numerous other questions that bothered me I finally found nothing to base my faith I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do I believe or why I don't believe Petri ' '' Petri Pihko kem pmp Mathematics is the ' ' ' ' ' Pihatie C Physics is the Rule of ' ' ' SF OULU kempmp the ' FINLAND Chemistry
