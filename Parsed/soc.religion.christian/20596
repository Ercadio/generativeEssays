From Carol Alvin Subject Re The arrogance of Christians Virgilio Dean Velasco writes In article A Carol Alvin writes Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and which truths are The answer to both questions is Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute To me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations True in every instance Do you agree with this definition I think you do Similarly all truth is Indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in When is something absolute When it is always Obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in A simple example In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in Now this is By your definition this is truth and therefore Do women in your church speak Do they cover their heads If all scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to Yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute And there are plenty of other Can you reconcile this Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the Such a statement is terribly self Let me put it to you this If there are no absolutes shouldn't we conclude that the statement There are no absolutes is not absolutely true Obviously we have a contradiction I don't claim that there are no I think there are very few though and determining absolutes is This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the There is hardly consensus even in evangelical Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding Biblical So People sometimes disagree about what is This does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the But you are claiming that all of Scripture is How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is Do you deny that your own background education prejudices come into play when you read the Bible and determine how to interpret a passsage Do you deny that you in fact interpret Carol Alvin
