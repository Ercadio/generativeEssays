From Will Taber Subject Re Being right about messiahs In article Desiree B Desiree Bradley writes I must have missed the postings about Waco David Koresh and the Second How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim they are I was just reading John this morning I think that is the right chapter anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with He said something along the lines of I will be in you and you will be in Again I cannot provide the exact quote or Anyway my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward It is an inward event Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in If you look for a person you will be It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that Oh and by the way I don't expect it to happen There is no one Second Coming there are a lot of little Every time Christ comes into someones heart Christ has come Peace William Taber Will T Any opinions expressed Data General are mine alone and may Westboro change without When all your dreams are laid to rest you can get what's second best But it's hard to get David Wilcox
