From Mark Ashley Subject Re When are two people married in God's eyes I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in God's eyes I'm waiting for an RC to speak up Nobody has so I Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the rock He said whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven and whatever you don't hold true won't be true in Therefore with respect to marriage the ceremony has to be done by an RC No big parties Just the priest the couple and Divorce is not But anullments are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope not sure if the Pope delegates this function Mark Ashley DISCLAIMER My Not Harris' The Lost Los Angelino
