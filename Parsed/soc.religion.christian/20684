from jon reid subject cell church discussion group i am beginning an e mail discussion group about cell churches if you are a follower of jesus christ and are - in a cell church, or - in a church that is transitioning to a cell church, or - just interested in learning more about cell churches, send me e-mail. (i reserve the right to remove anybody from the group who
does not demonstrate a spirit of humility and christlikeness.) -- ******************************************************************
