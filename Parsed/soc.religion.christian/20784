From Mark Ashley Subject Re hearing sinners In article A JEK writes On the question Does God hear the prayers of sinners we need to If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than centuries But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someone who says Lord I want you to do this for me but don't expect me to change my way of life that is a different I have no doubt that God hears everybody's However He does things His way things will happen only if it is His Now if the question really is Does God grant everybody's wishes then you'll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didn't get that toy you wanted for You just cannot expect to get everything you want in this Mark Ashley DISCLAIMER My Not Harris' The Lost Los Angelino
