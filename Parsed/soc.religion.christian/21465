From Christopher Mussack Subject Re Atheists and Hell To summarize While questioning the sagacity of someone who said they would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his I described how horrible hell is and compared the above statement with Jesus' suffering on the cross in order to prevent people going to which Kenneth Engel challenges Did this happen to Jesus I don't think so not from what I He lived ONE DAY of suffering and If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus paying for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as The point is that God understands the suffering we go through not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV but really understands He can feel our This fact is manifested by Jesus' We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us He is in everyone whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Now to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities but that wasn't my I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through Thankfully our moderator is but I seriously want a reasonable explanation for As I re read this I must admit that this is more of a description of my faith than an explanation but perhaps that's all I can do hopefully that's all I have to Chris Mussack
