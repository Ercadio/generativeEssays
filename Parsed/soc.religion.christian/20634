From Kershner Wyatt Subject Re quality of Catholic liturgy In article A Stephen Creps writes In article A John E Murray writes On Palm Sunday at our parish we were invited to take the role of Jesus in the I declined to Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but to no musicians readers and so New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the Mass is about to be In my mind I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay people to be aware of the Lord's As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran it is some of the innovations of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch the I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in the Catholic Church and I found it very Our Lutheran parish just instituted the Tenebrae service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was I heard and learned things that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels yet those facts were always As a matter of interest the pastor and I were talking about the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over breakfast Easter As a member of a liturgy committee I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of The priests don't seem even to want to make any decisions of their own in many I guess it's easier to try something new than it is to refuse to allow My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family called music and worship at our church Our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committee's It needs a strong hand to lead and guide to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical Additional reason for my leaving the Catholic faith lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my AKA wishy washy As you may gather from my comments I feel that it is very important ir regardless of denominational guidelines to have a service Mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered I am quite comfortable in a traditional Mass with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue the Sacrament of PENANCE not Reconciliation Stations of the Cross so on and so The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord but I don't want them attending a It's My church works hard to have a meaningful service during Lent on Wednesdays but follow traditional Lutheran Book of Worship Where things are changed or omitted during Lent such as the Hymn of Praise it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is Not Quite frankly it is very hard for a non Catholic to go to a Mass and fit in My dear wife never could former Methodist And Holy Week Masses and Vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non Those Catholics who have beared with me this far understand what I Please keep in mind why we are there to gather together in Not to worry about how something is done or not If there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing by all means talk to your priest or I have only ever met one who wouldn't They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to Use My differences with the Catholic Church are much more fundamental but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer intervention and sessions with priests and In Christ Kershner Kershner Wyatt kwyatt My opinions are my own and aren't necessarily my employer'
