From Gerry Palo Subject Re Good Jewish Arguments Kevin Finkenbinder wrote wrote intro Jesus wasn't really descended from David as the Messiah was supposed to have Joseph was but Christians say that Joseph wasn't related to Jesus If you look at the geneology of Christ in Luke and the one in Matthew you will notice that they trace different lines back to I have been told that one traces Mary's line back to David and the other traces Joseph's line back to Both of them go beyond David in history Acording to some of my Jewish friends Jewishness is passed to a child by the mother and the legal rights of Jewishness are passed through the If it is true that one of these geneologies is Mary's then Christ's bloodline is from David through His This also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of David as according to at least Roman law and possibly Mosaic law as well but I am not sure Joseph was Christ's LEGAL The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very According to Luke And when he began his ministry Jesus himself was about thirty years of age being supposedly the son of Joseph the son of Eli Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned there are two possible interpretations either Joseph was her father or he was her Clearly this is not A third would be that Joseph the son of Eli was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was But that would seem to be grasping at The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy in which case he would have named her but that he traces her husband's from David's son The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son Solomon to Matthew reads And to Jacob was born Joseph the husband of Mary by whom was born Jesus who is called There are two apparent The first is how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies which diverge with the sons of David Solomon and The second is why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all if Joseph had nothing to do with If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father then the original poster is quite correct that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances whatever Jesus's divine nature The second problem is easy in my We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any However a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them they had not known each other Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus the Virgin birth not To the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with more problems than it It is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of Except for the names of the parents and the child and the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation or from other external documents and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this In any case the details are described in Steiner's The Spiritual Guidance of the Human Being and of Humanity The Gospel of Luke and The Gospel of Matthew Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother this was never an issue with No one ever questioned his or Mary's The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David the Gerry Palo
