From Cardinal Ximenez Subject Atheists and Hell Hello I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes Atheists believe that when they die they die A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is I don't see what the problem is To Christians Hell is by definition eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful to most people eternal death is bad Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and Personally I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double edged sword issuing from his mouth I treat both these statements as Alan Terlep the scorpion says 'it's Oakland University Rochester MI in my ' Rushing in where angels fear to Jody
