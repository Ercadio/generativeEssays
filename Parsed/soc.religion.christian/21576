From Eugene B Geno Subject Re The doctrine of Original Sin In article M , Eugene B Geno writes Nothing unclean shall enter heaven Rev Therefore, babies are born in such a state that should they die, they are cuf off from God and put in hell, which is exactly the doctrine of St Augustine and St Thomas jeff adams Regarding the first paragraph, I would say that I didn't write it I don't believe that unbaptized babies are put in Hell I don't even believe in Hell At least, I don't believe in a fiery place where there will be gnashing of teeth geno
