From David Wagner Subject Re Baptism requires Faith Aaron Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes Aaron Colossians In him you were also circumcised in the Aaron putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done Aaron by Christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised Aaron with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him Aaron from the Aaron In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans Aaron through a personal faith in the power of Our parent's Aaron faith cannot do Do infants have faith Let's look at Aaron what the Bible has to say about Yes let Try And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his Mark Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such as I tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for It merely says that in baptism we are born again regenerated and resurrected through In the case of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant through the power of the The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of God's covenant with It was commanded to be performed on the eighth The early church understood this and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day or if it could in fact be done Aaron Romans But not all the Israelites accepted the good Aaron For Isaiah says 'Lord who has believed our message ' Aaron Consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the Aaron message is heard through the word of Aaron So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the Aaron message of the And the gospel is surely preached at any infant's or adult's Indeed in a very real sense the sacraments are the Gospel made Aaron Faith is a possible response to hearing Aaron God's word Kids are not yet spiritually Aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to Aaron God's How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith Do you know this on the basis of God's Word or from your own reason Faith is also described as a gift from God Ephesians He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults through the power of the gospel Romans Aaron If you read all of Ezekiel you will see that God doesn't Aaron hold us guilty for anyone else's So we can have no Aaron original guilt from Here you show that you just don't understand original sin you are arguing against a straw Maybe you've been talking to Catholics too I don't But original sin does not consist of God's imputation of Adam's guilt to It consists of our inheritance of Adam's sinful It is actual See for example the Augsburg Confession Article II and the Apology of the Augsburg Confession Article II and for extra credit John Knox's The Scots confession' Article Aaron Now then that we have a little more background as to why Aaron original sin is not Biblical let's look at some of the Aaron scriptures used to support Aaron Romans Therefore just as sin entered the world through Aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death came to Aaron all men because all sinned Ask yourself this Do infants ever die Then ask yourself If infant baptism is not valid then where was the Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all of the baptisms were performed on infants Were Luther Melancthon Calvin Zwingli Hus Knox Andrae and Chemnitz Christians Aaron Psalm Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time Aaron my mother conceived Aaron This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble Aaron ourselves before God in repentance for David himself Aaron was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after Aaron committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her Aaron All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time Aaron when he wasn't He is humbling himself before God by Aaron confessing his His saying that he was sinful at Aaron birth is a The Bible being inspired by God isn't Aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of Aaron speech as did Jesus John For another example of Aaron hyperbole see Luke Who are you to say what is literal and what is not Is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God You might also compare Genesis The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart Never again will I curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from Aaron We see Aaron that he did grow and become wiser in Luke and The Aaron implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he Aaron knew to choose right over You are a long way from proving this rather monstrous All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in A conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation of reason not on a direct revelation in David Wagner But mad reason rushes forth and a confessional Lutheran because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as Martin Luther Large Catechism Fourth Part
