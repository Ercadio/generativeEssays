From Subject Re When are two people married in God's eyes In article A Michael Covington writes In article A Robert Anderson writes I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in God's eyes Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony, nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so Let's distinguish real logistical problems like being stranded on a desert island from excuses such as waiting for so and so's brother to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony I disagree People marry each other When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing God knows our hearts He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another The way I see it, you'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between and years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows I don't think God keeps a scorebook Joe Moore
