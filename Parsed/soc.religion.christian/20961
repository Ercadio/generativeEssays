From Christopher Mussack Subject Re tuff to be a Christian Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy but here is my opinion In article A no name writes Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good as against Christ's we are all sinners I never thought of these two ideas being against each People might quibble about what intrinsically means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good but great that we can approach perfection albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism Because we do not realize our greatness we Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept Doesn't David ask in the Psalm what is man that you God should care for him but you have made him just a little lower than the angels I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was but David's power easily defeated Goliath' Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom Jesus says follow the I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life probably anticipating an attaboy from the Instead Jesus gives him a harder task sell everything and follow Jesus is raising the The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich Jesus says anyone can do it with God's Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people we can avoid getting angry at Not only can we avoid committing adultery we can control our own I realize this was not your main point but I wonder how other people see Parting Question Would you have become a Christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative And therefore I claim you are brain Please forgive any generalizations I am about to Your point about how hard other religions are is a good one just as your Parting Question is a tough I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do we can learn from their name submission Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists claim that God is Is God personal or impersonal I say yes but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is I think it is greater to be a personal entity with an individual consciousness but you're right that that might be a cultural If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem though that is hard to Are there any former or present Eastern Religion members here who could comment Chris Mussack
