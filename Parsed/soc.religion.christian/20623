From Malcusco Subject Re A question that has bee bothering In article A Cardinal Ximenez writes Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically removing the physical proofs of God's As time goes on we have to rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase science is removing our I don't think this is a bad First of all I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science or even that I am threatened at all although I admit the The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence God reveals Himself in many ways including to some degree My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations for example but He did not make that availible to Does that mean that if Science can over ride God's decision through alterations that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children Should men be allowed to have babies if that is made People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment Treatment that alleviates pain or prevents pain from occuring is perfectly acceptable I believe as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the However treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes go too Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study and where I would not but I will say this Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets one should ask why they want this Before one alters the body they have been given they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to Malcusco
