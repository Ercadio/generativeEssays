From Bill Irwin Subject Re What WAS the immaculate conception Randy Graca writes Consequently this verse indicates that she was without Also as was observed at the very top of this post Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the mother of Jesus who was definitely without If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to God then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus For that matter why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin either Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person the need for the last one Mary to have none puts God in a box where we say that He couldn't have incarnated Himself through a normal human My God is an all powerful God Who can do whatever suits His This includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age providing a path through the Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction and the birth of Himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original I see far too much focus on the objects of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the Author of our existence without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to God in the form of Mary Apostles and a Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin the Immaculate Conception is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned during her lifetime which is a separate doctrine and I believe also held by the Catholic If Mary was born without original sin and didn't sin during her lifetime how is she any different from Jesus This means the world has had two perfect humans one died to take away the sins of the world the other gave birth to Him I would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start praying to anyone other than Everything I have ever read from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless Lamb of God not His mother Hope this is useful to Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC Thank Bill Irwin The Westrheim Group Vancouver BC Canada uunet twg bill voice Your Computer fax Systems Partner
