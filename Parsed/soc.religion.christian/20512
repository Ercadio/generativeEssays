From Carol Alvin Subject Re The arrogance of Christians Virgilio Dean Velasco writes I just thought I'd share some words that I received in a letter from Moody Bible Institute a couple of months The words are by James Stowell the president of The other day I was at the dry cleaner and the radio was It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical Christians saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes He missed the No IMO Stowell missed the We affirm the absolutes of Scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in God who is truth who has revealed His truth in His Word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to I don't see how that necessarily Are all truths also absolutes Is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes If the answer to either of these questions is no then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths and which truths are And who is qualified to make these determinations There is hardly consensus even in evangelical Christianity not to mention the rest of Christianity regarding Biblical I find Stowell's statement terribly simple Carol Alvin
