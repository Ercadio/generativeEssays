From REXLEX Subject ARSENOKOITAI Bailey Boswell continuing with DeYoung's article SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI Bailey Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of He takes the term in I Cor as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts in contrast to malakoi effeminate those who engage passively in such However he insists that Paul knew nothing of inversion as an inherited trait or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion Hence Bailey limits the term's reference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as Bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual condition which is morally neutral and homosexual practices italics in source Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation sodomites best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment Bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical Boswell The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of John Whereas the usual translation of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense Boswell gives it a passive In an extended discussion of the term he cites linguistic evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male sexual agents active male His argument is that the arseno part of the word is adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual Hence the term according to Boswell designates a male sexual person or male He acknowledges however that most interpret the composite term as active meaning those who sleep with make their bed with Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical He argues that in some compounds such as paidomathes child learner the paido is the subject of manthano and in others such as paidoporos through which a child passes the paido is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal His point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its More directly he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno employ it objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time namely drauci or These were male prostitutes having men or women as their The Greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci the corresponding passive would be parakoitai one who lies beside Boswell He claims that arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to Paul for a male prostitute since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos fornicator and porneuon one committing fornication found also in the LXX had been adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus Plato Aristotle and Plutarch and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of Paul He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo Lucian Sextus Empiricus and He subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions of homosexual relation among Christian sources in Greek including the Didache Tatian Justin Martyr Eusebius Clement of Alexandria Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom is singled out for his omission as final proof that the word could not mean Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers Cited are Tertullian Arnobius Lactantius and The last named uses Other Latin writers include Ausonius Cyprian and Minucius The term is also lacking in state and in church By the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife Having surveyed the sources Boswell concludes There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter and every reason to suppose that whatever they came to mean they were not determinative of Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not disapprove of gay inclination gay relationships enduring love between persons of the same
