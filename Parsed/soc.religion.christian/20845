From no name Subject tuff to be a Christian DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes I don't think most people understand what a Christian It is certainly not what I see a lot in Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago as were all of the holy books Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern Ignore the For heaven's sake don't take it Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere But So you think it is easy to be a Muslim Or be a Buddhist The Buddha's commandments are yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good as against Christ's we are all sinners Only we allow ourselves to be By meditating we can awaken ourselves etc etc Also there is no concept of God in In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist But to awaken yourself is no easy Can you stay away from eating meat Can you sit still and think of nothing meditate for sometime everyday Buddhists do or are supposed to Can you pray five times a day Can you fast for a month every year Ramzan Are you willing to give th of your income as tithe Muslims In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man just as Buddha and Mohamed probably with a philosopy ahead of the times where he lived Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion compared to Hindiusm Judaism Zorasterism Buddihsm it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ And perhaps some But leave the crap in it out woman was created after man to be his helper etc aras just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes We don't rush it in one day Christianity is your whole It is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a We box everything into time Such as work at this time sports Tv social God is above these boxes and should be When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and other brain washers Oh boy what an act they put on with an number to turn in your God it seems is alive and well inside these carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for Parting Question Would you have become a Christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative And therefore I claim you are brain
