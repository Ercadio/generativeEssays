From Bill Rea Subject Re The arrogance of Christians Carol Alvin wrote In the New Testament sorry I don't have a Bible at work and can't provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in Now this is By your definition this is truth and therefore Do women in your church speak Do they cover their heads If all scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to Yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute And there are plenty of other Can you reconcile this The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or I've known all sorts of Christians ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire breathing fundamentalists and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a perhaps the source of absolute truth I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living While I am not a Roman Catholic I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church perhaps an RC would like to comment The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the You would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat and cane and give you some big song and dance routine about why this other passages as well aren't directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they actually practice are two different things but mostly it doens' While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy in this case making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into But if we step back from the name calling and look at what people are attempting to say we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian So when people use such words or phrases as Word of God inerrant infallibale The Manufacturer's Handbook The only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the Bible we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self contradictory but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks Where are you and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like I'm here in this The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others I hope this Bill Rea o o w U w Bill Rea Computer Services Centre E Mail University of Canterbury or Christchurch New Zealand Phone Fax
