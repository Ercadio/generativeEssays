From JEK Subject When are two people married LISTOWNER I have sent this to Mr Anderson Post it only if you think it of general Here is a copy of something I wrote for another You may find it A listmember asks What makes common law marriages wrong A common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in There is nothing in the Bible Old or New Testament about getting married by a preacher or by a priest Jewish or Christian And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the In fact the traditional Christian view at least in the West is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as a HOWEVER The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether a commitment has been Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows Instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live After a year or so the man says to the woman Hey honey it was great while it lasted but I think it's time to move She says What are you talking about He says I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and She says But you can' We are married He says What are you talking about We never got She says I remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made You said My love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the As long as I live I am yours utterly and When I lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your He says Oh that That was just Just When a man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like You mustn't take them And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public The Church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice The State insists on it since the state has a concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to Prospective fathers in law insist on it because they don't want their daughters seduced and Prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment or just And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just This is the real Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage The Church goes further and insists that when Christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret Try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you Similarly the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether You are my main squeeze and I am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others and till death do us This topic has come up on the list Is there any topic that hasn't One listmember was asking If a couple love each other and are living together isn't that marriage in the eyes of God Eventually someone asked In that case what is their status if they break up Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk out on The original questioner said Good grief I never thought of that In fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other is trying to have it both ways to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of At this point someone may say None of this applies to me and my We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment 'for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do ' So in our case no ceremony is To this my reply would be The reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous However testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you Back to the original We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around He asks At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married I answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both If they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace Yours James Kiefer
