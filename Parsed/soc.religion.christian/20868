From Jeffrey S Little Subject Re Revelations BABYLON In article A JBUDDENBERG Jimmy Buddenberg writes Hello We are doing a bible study at my college on We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable We are now on chapters and which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of I believe the beast is the Antichrist some may differ but it seems obvious and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic What are some views on this interpretation Is the falling Babylon in chapter the same Babylon in as in chapter The Catholic church Hate to step on thanks An interesting interpretation of Revelation and has been given by evangelist David I am not saying that I totally agree with his interpretation but it is certainly believable and good food for He interprets the Babylon of Revelation as being none other than the good old of That's right He supports his claim in several The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce and the WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon The American dollar despite the Japanese success of the century is STILL the most sought after currency in the If the were destroyed wouldn't the whole world mourn The bible also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots sin and adultery I am paraphrasing of course Babylon's sin affected or should I say infected the whole It doesn't take much looking to see that the is in a state of moral Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the do it if it feels good mentality all over the I think though that what Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls Babylon Babylon the Great and portrays it as the most powerful nation on No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country I don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the is STILL the most powerful nation on Again this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own but I do find it worthy of Jeffrey Little
