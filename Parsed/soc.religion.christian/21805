From Who Subject Islam Satanic Dear fellow Christians I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which I am We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of I said What I did not believe that because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them in my point of view they don't sin as much as I do How come if they were under Satan they could have such To tell you the truth I don't know much about But I know that they believe in God they believe in the day of Now I'm asking you what your opinions about Islam and its IMPORTANT I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or I do not want to discuss about politic related to I post this in and In Christ our Lord Jesus loves Tabut Torsina TORSINA Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam since there's a group for But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules since the question of whether non Christians are saved is at the heart of The classic Christian view which I think most people believed until the last century or so was that Christianity and of course Judaism was the only religion founded by God and that all other religions worshipped false gods and came from This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians and possibly Jews will be This need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion nor that all of their members are intentionally After all in order to be an effective snare Satanic alternatives would have to be Thus they might contain all kinds of truth wisdom and spiritual They would be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through If this is the background of your teacher's remarks and I suspect it is that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with It may teach a fine code of behavior and its practitioners may all be wonderful But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ it could still be a Satanic This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and Those are good things and we should encourage But no one is able to do them enough to be Salvation requires Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant There's a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications but in different A religion may be quite attractive in all visible But if it doesn't have Christ it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful tastes great but is missing some essential food element so that you end up Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this What I'm trying to do is as usual to clarify Indeed it is now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for clh
