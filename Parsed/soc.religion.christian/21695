From Paul Robinson Subject Homosexuality is Immoral non religious argument This was crossposted to a zillion I don't intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun However I thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion clh I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call I intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this I intend to also show that such a declaration can be made without there being a religious justification for morality in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral or that collaterally it is a morally valid practice is free to do I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to This should be fun to try and figure this out and I want to try and expose no pun intended my ideas and see other people's and see where their ideas are As I'm not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion I will be posting an announcement of it to several and if someone thinks of appropriate groups let me If someone on here doesn't receive let me know and I'll make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as I'll use that as the main forum for By exception to usual policy is that I normally charge for this but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on Internet or I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger audience on usenet internet than on the smaller BBS To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger this will begin on Monday May to give people who want to make the response time to identify Anonymous postings are acceptable since some people may not wish to identify Also if someone else wants to get in on my side they are free to do This should be much more interesting than Abortion debates
