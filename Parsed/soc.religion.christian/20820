From Len Howard Subject Re Can sin block our prayers In article A Jayne Kulikauskas writes Mike McCormick writes Not honoring our wives can cause our prayers to be hindered prayers may not be I Peter One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate He must honor her as his sister in This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks Jayne Kulikauskas I would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to 'blocking' I have trouble thinking that God would allow anything to block our access to him in prayer especially if we have sinned and are praying for I can see however how our prayer life might be hindered by our sin if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has happened we may not be thinking about prayer thus our prayers are 'hindered' by our own But I don't think anything can 'block' the transmission or reception of prayer to Shalom Len Howard
