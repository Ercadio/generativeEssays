From David Goggin Subject Dreams and out of body incidents hey folks I'm fairly new to these groups tho' some have heard from me I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot What morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents In normal dreams you can't control anything so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE it seems like a morality Now there seem to be alternatives Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene' that is not trying to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own are 'another plane' Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one A mark of objective fact is that people report the same objective In this case the same interpersonal morality ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking Like but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence a different moral ethics apply there and no or maybe different moral laws apply There it Is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know of another alternative respond by post or thanks very much dt
