From Timothy J Brent Subject Am I going to Hell I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist but definitely do not believe in the christian The recent discussion about atheists and hell combined with a post to another group to the effect of 'you will all go to hell' has me interested in the consensus as to how a god might judge As a catholic I was told that a jew buddhist might go to heaven but obviously some people do not believe Even more see atheists and pagans I assume I would be lumped into this category to be I know you believe only god can judge and I do not ask you to just for your Thanks Tim
