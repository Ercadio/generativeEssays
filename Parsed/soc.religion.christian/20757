From REXLEX Subject Re RE Does God love you In article A Jayne Kulikauskas writes I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on God deserves our love and worship because of who He I do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting And yet Jayne as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on Hell figures in a large of the time certainly more than heaven Paul as we learn in I Thess taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and Rev chapter is very specific and cannot be I think the word throne is used times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement for in John we read that they are already Rom speaks that every mouth will be There is no recourse excuse or I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with putting into words and explaining that Preaching the Gospel without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a clanging Yes I agree with Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at I think we have seen the extreme of the hell fire brimstone preacher but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries but I remember him telling a He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or He believed everybody was going to It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell Of course the man wouldn't do But the point was Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't If this man had he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer And yet they walk as if they believe they will never be sent I'd use a different illustration I have to include myself in When I watch say a Basketball go Bulls game and I see a blatant foul that isn't called oi vey What's with that ref that he didn't make that It's And just so in life righteousness demands As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away so God cuts off that which is still of the old We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life then broad is the way to Here's a question How many of you are Christians because you are afraid of going to Hell How many are responding to God's love I think I would fall in there Actually it was After all repentance isn't only a turning towards but also a turning away from No again if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it In love of course but in truth most I have thought about writing something on this topic but not now and I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its God is Yes He is love but His love has the boundary of Dignity of Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible If responsible then he is also The awfulness of Today we have a poor poor concept of sin He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to the whosoever Rex
