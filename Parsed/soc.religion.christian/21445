From Daniel Cossack Subject Re Christianity and repeated lives Scott A Mayo writes Gerry Palo writes is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on Doesn't it say somewhere It is appointed to man once to die and then judgement I don't have a concordance here but I have some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is I'd say that more or less decides the Heb clh That depends on how this verse is There are at least two meanings of the word once only one time and at some other time once upon a time Note that in the previous verse the word once is used with the second meaning and also in the following verse once is again used with the second The Greek I am sure uses different words for each of the two meanings for the English word once I am not a Greek scholar but I'm sure someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this If the second meaning is being used that verse can be interpreted as for it was once given for men to die beginning with Adam but after this gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ the judgement is made available for now there is no longer death but life with Daniel Cossack Senior Software Engineer Dupont Drive Irvine CA Procom Technology
