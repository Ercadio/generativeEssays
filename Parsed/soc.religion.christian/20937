From REXLEX Subject Assurance of Hell I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned and the trumpet had I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their They cried for the rock and the They prayed but their prayers were too The soul that had put off salvation Not tonight I'll get saved by and No time now to think of religion Alas he had found time to And I saw a Great White Now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation yet Jesus thought it Paul thought it Paul said Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade Today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical We don't tell people anymore that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as As Jayne has said this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball Yet the fact remains there is a place called A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience Whatever you or I as Christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer Jesus in tells us that He didn't prepare hell for He prepared it for the Devil and his No where in the Bible do I read anywhere that God predestined anybody to go to Moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont' Whether or not that's theologically sound I couldn't defend but its Jesus said to the people of Israel Ye would Now some of you may not be students of the Bible heck some of you may not be Have you ever said to somebody I don't believe in I believe in the religion of But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the Several times he talks about hell and about In fact over and over in the synoptics Matthew Mark and Luke Jesus talks about Not Not Not John the Baptist though he did but Jesus the Son of The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go Now if there is no hell then Jesus preached in It was our Lord Jesus not some angry Baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes Jesus said It was Jesus who called hell a furnace of It was Jesus that used the word And this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are Jesus said How can we get it across to you that a loving dying Jesus preached about hell Not only that but He went through That's what Calgary was all When my Lord was on the cross darkness He called hell outer Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there That's not what hell Hell's not a There's no fellowship He called it outer Outer away from Darkness God is No when He was on the cross He was made sin for you and for God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be That's is a sobering As my son would say an awesome My God My God why hast Thou forsaken me Hell is There's no fellowship in There's no friendship in There's no loving embrace in There's no hand shake in There's no word of encouragement in I It goes much deeper than physical Hell is eternal craving with no The man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body will crave it eternally and not be One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves What is hell Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the In a recent post I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life I've remembered his name Jack Wertzen and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to They sing these songs and read Bible verses and their praising this and that I can't stand it Jack do you think God would send me to hell Jack answered by saying Yes I think he would Of course the barber said What do you mean by Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity You'd be Because God loves you He'd put you where it would match what you really It makes a man The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal Don't ask me how I don't But He is God and He is the infinite eternal and when He died He died an infinite eternal It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the whosoever He suffered eternal A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying Everybody is going to be saved My Bible says no He'll separate The sheep from the you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for No my Bible says that It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes Some of the cultist believe in After you die Just like a mosquito you're squished No in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire Word of There is a place called If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there I'd give it to you but I haven't found That fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible the fact that He has placed us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two As I've already If you are a Christian you must worn Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is Knowing therefore the terror of Lord we persuade If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior you're taking an awful As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and I am wrong then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist but if I am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal I don't mean to make fun at this point but its like Dirty Harry said You've got to ask yourself 'Do I feel lucky ' Well do you A man's got to know his Don't be one of the whosoever wont' Because while I was yet a sinner He died for There's no greater love than this that a man lay down his life for Rex
