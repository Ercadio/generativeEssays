From REXLEX Subject Re Assurance of Hell In article A Lawrence Foard writes and many others mailed Here is a reply to one of the Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell There's nothing like a preacher to put fear into an ignorant If God hadn't created Hell in the first place there'd be no no need to die and save Isn't it also a bit paradoxical to say God died when in fact no such thing is remotely Can the infinite die Your using century concepts to interprete century Of course in your termonology God could not cease to However that is not what death ever means in the If you will study the word you will see that it signifies Death is separation not This is the reason for the agony of the For the first time in eternity one member of the Godhead was separated from the other I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever She was as personable as any saint ever She was to become my girlfriend for several However having been drafted we were separated by To me that was a form of Later she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me That to me was It was separation from that which had made me Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship not because He chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven Thank you for this What respect I had for the man now has been diminished I promise never again to say how wise or loving this man When I rebelled against my earthly father he spanked I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and If God warns of impending danger that is If choose to let us do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be You have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for Being Jesus was allegedly God I doubt he could honestly feel the pinpricks man dealt This may give light to the error of your One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct Faith and knowledge are Jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of As the Scripture say For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but One who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without The kenosis passage of Phil states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about It was to be my PhD The Consciousness of I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study including It is my conclussion that as Jesus the member of the Trinity actually suffered as we He became part of the human race and experienced it as we He grew in He chose not to grasp His omniscience but chose to be It is my understanding that He was led of the Spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as But in Jn where the adulterous women was thrown before Him the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by That is He was not aware that this event was to take place in He was living sequential history as you or Maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than Thanks again for the Just so you know some friends and I are starting a Freethinkers organization and I'm going to use some of the info you provided for an organization intro I was once a member of that THe free thinker is a glorious By contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist that is his But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the Christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a If there is no faith there can be no There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other Pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be dubiously of The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of In fact it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms hence the term a Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to However they disproved their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though That is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is Next time you're in a room of skeptics yell out Look your fly is undone Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without To stress this is to belabor the obvious but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an The answer to this impasse lies in a way of knowing one which is based on But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and In other words another Presuppositions my It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for I tell you what if God condemns me for being honest He is unworthy of my Better to burn in Hell than to serve a tyrant in Of course that is hardly an original Milton coined it but it had been in use for It was even used in the first Highlander But again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what He has revealed of Himself through history through His prophets through His Word and lastly but most of all thru His If you are to reject God's annointed savior then reject Him from a correct understanding of Rex
