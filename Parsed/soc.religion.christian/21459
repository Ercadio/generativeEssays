From Christopher Mussack Subject Re Atheists and Hell In article M Stephen McIntyre writes In article A trajan Stephen McIntyre writes Besides I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his This display of bravado is no I've no fear any God or His That was my If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet anything I But I shan't go to heaven it would be against my sense of humanity and compassion for my fellow This is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature not just out of a need to The God of both Testaments are one and the same and in neither is there evidence God is strictly To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written there is evidence of love but that is a cultural This is a poor answer which you needn't I will now pull the old bait and I think you should use the Bible to judge man not By that I mean if your moral intuition doesn't like what is described in the Bible realize that such things are going on I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it Not you specifically but everyone including If I don't like the genocide in the Bible what about the genocide that goes on right now To move beyond the question of a hell realize that many people right now are If you think hell isn't fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence what about how life isn't fair Right now there is a young mother with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through the Right now there is a sixth grader who is a Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't we help I think you are correct to challenge any Christian who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to You want evidence of Find someone who is making a difference someone you admire someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head Ask the person how he does Ask the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his Ask the woman who was pregnant at kept the baby and now is a successful business Ask the doctor who has operated on a pound They won't all be Christians or even what you might call religious but there will be something in God is not defined in the Bible God is defined by what is in those people's It doesn't matter if you can't give intellectual assent to any description you've heard they're all wrong The compassion you already feel in your heart is a step in the right Follow that Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same thing described If nothing else makes sense hang on to that idea that God is I would say something similar but in reverse order love is Good I guess we only have to work on your Chris Mussack
