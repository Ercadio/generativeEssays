From Subject Re Monophysites and Mike Walker In article M Andrew Byler writes Mike Walker If you are using the standard formula of fully God and fully human that I'm not sure why you object to saying that Jesus was I think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of It's a consequence of the Jesus is human but not a fallen clh I differ with our moderator on I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer puts it was that Jesus was tempted but did not If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity then Jesus fully human Nicea would not be subject to sin but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we To distinguish between human and fallen human makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him These issues get mighty When you see people saying different things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different I don't think there's any question that there is a problem with Nestorius and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is But I'd like to be a bit wary about the Copts Armenians Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had Nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of More moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox Theodore of My impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just Nestorius' version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as clh First the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from Second the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary arguing I think correctly that a human could not be called Mother of I mean in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son uncreate surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Anyway Nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus which would require two seperate and distinct The argument fails though because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept Nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined a la Second I am not sure that Nestorianism is not a better alternative than the orthodox After all I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven likewise post I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon It was a seperate nature capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature Comments on the above warmly Jason Albert There may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin The original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call Jesus fully human because he didn't I completely agree that Jesus was subject to I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing he is thereby not fully I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and I agree with you and have said elsewhere that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents I thought he got the better of However most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance and that Nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of The Christological Controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his As regular Usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being Furthermore he did say some things that I think are He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of In it he says To attribute also to the Logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have to some degree a part in being born growing up and Of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos' participation in these But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we don't have an incarnation at Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this You say I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in I don't think that's required by orthodox It's the divine Logos that is clh
