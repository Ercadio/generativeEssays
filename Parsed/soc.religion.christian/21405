From Michael Covington Subject Re Translations In article M Andi Beyer writes Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most accurate translation Well, knowing Greek and Hebrew, I'm probably not as picky about translations as I would be if English translations were my only source of information BUT Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans lations is almost certainly unclear in the original It is very bad practice to shop for a translation that fits your own doctrinal positions Personally, I still like the RSV NRSV and NASV are also very good I have a strong preference for editions that do not indent the beginning of each verse as if verses were paragraphs The verse numbering is a relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence Michael A Covington, Associate Research Scientist Artificial Intelligence Programs The University of Georgia phone Athens, Georgia U S A amateur radio N TMI
