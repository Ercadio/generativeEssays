From joseph dale fisher Subject Re Eternity of Hell was Re Hell In article A Darius Lecointe writes insert deletion of unnecessary quote Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his First of all God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion Ex However if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell then why would he send Jesus to seek and save that which was lost Luke To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of Their judgement is soon to Let me suggest Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for Stay away from human theories and only take into account references in the You asked for Peter ff talks about how those who are ungodly are Matthew is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for Thessalonians states that those who cause trouble for the disciples will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord Thessalonians talks about those who refuse to love the truth being Revelation talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do Those who do not listed in verse will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur Revelation gives the indication that those who follow the beast will be tormented with burning sulfur and there being no rest day or night for them because of Psalm The wicked return to the grave all the nations that forget I think those should be sufficient to prove the Darius Joe Fisher In the following I'm mostly playing devil's advocate I'm not advocating either My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that Rev often uses the term second death The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second it uses terms that can be understood either My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either As Tom Albrecht commented the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire whatever the To make things more interesting Luke implies that the damned don't get resurrected at Presumably they just stay yes I'm aware that it's possible to understand this passage in a non literal Peter ff is talking about angels and talks about holding them in hell until the final This isn't eternal Matthew talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his Rev and talk about the eternal fire as They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in When talking about people being thrown into it it is referred to as the second death This sounds more like extinction than eternal Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil and humans Thessalonians similarly what is everlasting destruction This is not necessarily eternal This one can clearly be understood either way but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in Thessalonians again talks about Revelation see comment above Revelation is probably the best of the Even there it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer It says that the smoke and presumably the fire is eternal and that there is no respite from But it doesn't say that the people are tormented Psalm I don't see that it says anything relevant to this clh
