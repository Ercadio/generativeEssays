From joseph dale fisher Subject Re tuff to be a Christian In article A no name writes DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes I don't think most people understand what a Christian It is certainly not what I see a lot in Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God's He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago as were all of the holy books Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern Ignore the For heaven's sake don't take it Please leave heaven out of For his own sake I pray that Dan does take it literally because that's how God intended it to be Dan your view of many groups appears correct from my point of However I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of I have no clue where wwc is but please mail I'd really like to get you in touch with Hey we can't do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives over to That's tuff and most people don't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere But insert deletion of ranting about other religions which obviously has gone off center of Dan's original context Dan I'm familiar with this You've got a point There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple some have no clue about it because they've not been taught some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the However Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke and Luke My question is why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional I certainly don't have an answer to insert deletion Parting Question Would you have become a Christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative And therefore I claim you are brain My parents had nothing to do with God had and has everything to do with As for these attacking responses I must say that I disagree with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements possibly to the point of slander when talking about people not what they Please if you have a response state it instead of flying off the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with what is being I'm sure both Dan and I would have a much happier time with your Joe
