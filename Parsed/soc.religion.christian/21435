From Bill Mayne Subject Re Why do people become atheists In article M writes christians can also feel that sense of difference however when they are associated with those weird televangelists who always talk about satan if you'll excuse the cliched sound of this everyone has to deal with his her differences from other i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for This is not at all Christianity is the main stream in western You are trivializing the experiences of I remember what it was like being different as a We were told all the time that we were different and in fact that only members of the our church were really Christians though others who believed in God weren't as bad as atheists so we were a small That was nothing compared to being an The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian being surrounded by staunch atheists including parents who actively persecute any religious tendancies both actual punishments and even worse emotional They would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their Maybe these conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union not in a country with under God in its pledge of I doubt it even then because children have to be taught to be Christians and hence must have support I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves because I've been Only in my case it was my rationality instead of sexuality which I was forced to try to in some way the pressures were different of course because you chose your beliefs or are you saying that they were not your choice but born of necessity please no flames about whether or not gay people choose their lifestyle that's elsewhere in this newsgroup My atheism was born of For an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to Will or wishes have nothing to do with I could choose to lie or to be silent about my true I could no more choose to believe in the God of Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through with what gays go However it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by Happily some are made stronger once we get past I must say that I wasn't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends who didn't become I was just hurt i'm not sure i understand this sentence could you explain Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even or especially on those who don't get free of I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and I feel no need to defend By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the In the end it has been as someone eloquently put it in private email an experience of liberation rather than Bill Mayne
