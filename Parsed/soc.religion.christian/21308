From Michael Walker Subject Re Question about Virgin Mary Aziz Faris writes Helllo Netters I was told the Bible says that God took the body of the Virgin Mary as she was being carried for Is this true if so were in the Bible does it say Regards I think you're talking about the assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary It says that The Immaculate Mother of God the ever Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly This was defined by a Papal statement in though it had certainly been believed by some before Like the Immaculate Conception this is primarily a Roman Catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct Biblical Note that Catholics do not believe in sola scriptura That is they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of Christian Thus the fact that a doctrine has little Biblical support is not necessarily significant to They believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church and also that it can be revealed to the I'm not interested in yet another Catholic Protestant argument but if any Catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs I think it would be clh Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither the time nor the proper materials with me you would think I would learn my lesson by now but I'm trying to finish writing my Thesis and don't have tons of The basis for our the catholic church's belief in the assumption of Mary body and soul into heaven is that to put it simply the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed In fact throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary and of the were present when she Only Thomas was missing when he arrived several days later he asked to be shown her body and moved with pity Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her When they arrived the seal was still They broke the seal entered and the body was There was no sign that anyone had entered forcibly or otherwise and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven and the apostles TAUGHT this in their preaching of course this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of Basicaly as an apostolic church founded by the apostles we believe that the teachings of the apostles whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources is true providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be At least in the case of the assumption of Mary the authenticity is quite Hope this helps I would welcome anyone who has more information to add to what I've Mike Walker of Illinois
