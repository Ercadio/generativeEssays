From Bill Rea Subject Re Portland earthquake Paul Hudson Jr wrote In article M Bill Rea writes in history seems to imply some pretty serious The one of the pastors in the church I attend Christchurch City Elim considers that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a judgement from the Lord is a clear sign that the prophesy is not from the I would like to see his reasoning behind You may have gotten If I get a chance I will ask them this burned by natural disaster prophecies down there but that does not mean that every natural disaster judgement prophecy is Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious that judgement prophecies can be here in the US it seems like we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies though I am sure there may be a few people who are too into The words I have underlined are at the heart of the A quick look doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Having studied the Jeremiah Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement Let me make one The clash between Jeremiah and the false prophets was primarily in the theological The false prophets understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's descendants came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign Jeremiah was not a Judahite He was from Anathoth across the border in what had formerly been Israelite When he came to prophesy he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of His theology clashed with the theology of the local It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his The judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with theological In my opinion both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson New York will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah Bill Rea o o w U w Bill Rea Computer Services Centre E Mail University of Canterbury or Christchurch New Zealand Phone Fax
