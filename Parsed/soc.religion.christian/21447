From Stan Friesen Subject Re MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY In article M you write My comments were long enough that I don't want to repeat them here but I'll send them via email back to the Certainly it was not intended to be a description of three similar deities though I certainly see why it would look that Thanks for the letter your comments helped As to the last comment I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that I am still trying to understand how a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading sort of they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways but really they are one trust me Neither of these is acceptible to The fact is so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any sense to me are the modalistic ones such as Modalistic Monarchianism or Economic Trinitarianism I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God so I perhaps lean more towards the latter I am trying here to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and formerly tdatirv sarima or I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to the extent that well meaning people think they've just flat out There's no problem with things being both and if the are different parts of the Father Son and Holy Spirit aren't exactly parts of God because parts are things distinguished by physical All three Persons are omnipresent so they are obviously aren't physically But they're in some way different aspects modes or whatever of one If you accept economic trinitarianism it's possible that you don't have any substantive difference with the standard Is it possible that you just don't find the neo Platonic explanation illuminating clh
