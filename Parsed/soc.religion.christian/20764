From Jon Ogden Subject Re Help I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying' You fools do you still think that just believing is enough ' Stuff deleted Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat out' Can anyone help me this really bothers Will there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in I will make the case here though and try to help you out For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Not of works lest any man should Ephesians Yes it is by God's grace and our faith that we are We are not saved by what we However If ye love me keep my John Keeping Christ's commandments is a work per se and a demonstration of our love for Also He spake also this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground And he answering said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it And if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it Luke Again Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it John It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth What is that Well Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love joy peace patience All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ but does not do the things Christ commanded I dare say that they really don't have any Asking which is more important faith or works is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more Good works should come out of and be a result of our To have faith true faith in Christ requires you to do what he The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no Christs commands are actions and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit then we shall be uprooted just like the It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the In other words I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the Words and talk mean I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will but this should be Hope it Jon sig file please try
