from subject paul on weekly collections mark gregory foster writes concerning corinthians the idea was introduced to me once that the reason paul wanted > the corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the > first day of the week was that this was when they received their > weekly wages. but the ancient romans did not observe a seven-day week. unless a
man was working for a jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been
paid on the first day of a seven-day week. nor would a jewish
employer have kept his wages over the week-end (see lev 19:13; dt
24:15). yours, james kiefer
