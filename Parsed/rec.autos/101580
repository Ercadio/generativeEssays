From Michael Smith Subject Re How hard to change springs on truck Bottom line I did it and it Some 'tips and techniques' are included here In article James Callison writes In article Michael Smith writes Does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a Ford truck This is a with leaf springs front and So with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a hydrolic bottle jack can I do this at home I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the And a can of The sockets needed were metric exact fit but I was able to use some SAE and are rather close to and It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford I'm pictureing this Undo U Put a bottle jack on the axle and raise the bed frame to take stress off of the leaf Undo the end bolts Drop the Turn the bottom Re connect the spring Sounds about Didn't have to undo the end bolts Just the U bolts on each side and the shock Jacking up the frame some more had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame I't one TALLL lifted the spring free of the Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other No wrench Vice Grips worked I soaked the nut with and it came right Flipped the bottom spring and Is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically demanding thing to do Well it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a OK well maybe it's not that easy but it's not terribly I donno I'm a little more sore today than after working on a A foot pipe cheater was a real Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is to ft lbs A doesn't have that kind of torque spec It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring Squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for then I could let go to get the nut wrench Vice Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge until I discovered that the axel had Tilted and or rolled One the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right On the passenger side I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about inch to get things to line Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore since it HAD been lined up before and I didn't move it something ELSE must have hmmm axle no longer constrained not to move hmmm move it After that it was all much easier to 'close up' BTW the ride is now softer but not quite as soft as I was hoping At least it now sits Michael Smith ems 'Whatever you can do or dream you can begin Boldness has genius power and magic in ' Goethe I am not responsible nor is anyone Everything is
