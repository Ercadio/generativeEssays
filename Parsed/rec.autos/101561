From DEMOSTHENIS ZEPPOS Subject Re Integra GSR In article J on Cochran writes I'd like to add the Beretta GTZ as a car which will kick GS R butt anyday and it's a lot cheaper to boot I will take this one with a definate grain of Performance data shows a If this poster has some proof other than my friend blew one away last week Want proof Here is some data on acceleration and handling from Motor Trend apr ' Integra GS R Beretta GTZ mile L acc g's Slalom WRONG Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's slalom times they are right along with the Integra and the car does that with small inch tires that are all weather not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than a Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine Road Track and Car Driver have the GS R at to for Road and Also Quarter mile times vary from to You can't tell exactly by the Furthermore the Integra will definately outrun the Beretta on the high Car Driver and Road track have the GS R doing to mph and it gets there So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep up with it in And the Beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage hp torque for the Integra for the Beretta You always believe those exact numbers why don't you drive a GS R and see for your self while the GS R has a low torqye its high gearing over a rpm make up for the difference still wouldn't call it a torque moster though The biggest advantage would have to be the The Integra costs as tested Motor Trend the GTZ costs as tested The GTZ also has standard nicities and Airbag and Antilock An airbag is not available on the Integra and lower models do not have Considering you save almost dollars for the Beretta and the is a reliable engine it doesn't make sense to get the Integra as a performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out to Quad reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance Acura has the engine wins the reliablity contest hands You can rev that car all day everyday and you'll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything I speak from expierence I'm not saying the Quad is a bad engine but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same NOTE this isn't a flame on the GTZ or other GM Quad THe Berreta is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention it has an But to start quoting figures from one source isn't too Read other sources and drive both While I haven't driven a GTZ I have driven GTs and Grand Ams with Quad engines so they are
