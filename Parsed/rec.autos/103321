From George Louie Subject Pennsylvania Insurance Limited Tort Option Hey all I'm looking at buying a new car but I'm confused about the insurance This also applies to my existing car insurance Does anyone understand what the Limited Tort Option Will it lower my rates if I opt to have it or will it be more expensive if I opt to have it What does it do for me in layman's terms please Is it a good deal or should I ignore it I'm not the type to sue anyone at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to the insurance company as a vandalism Please Thanks in George
