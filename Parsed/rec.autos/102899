From Bob Blackshaw Subject Re Dumbest Driver Action In Mark Wayne Blunier writes Jim Frost writes I wish I had the figures with me to back me up but I recall statistics showing that women tended to have more accidents than men but the damage was generally quite Men had fewer but far more expensive The rate of total vehicle destruction was significantly higher for men than women particularly in the younger male age IMHO social considerations are probably the strongest influence here possibly more so than any difference between the Social influences often affect the type of car that's bought and the situations the car is used in and the type of car and driving situations have a major effect on accident Thus if society expects you to buy a Mustang and race it on the street you're more likely to do it and our society expects that of males more than I agree with some of your social influences such as driving conditions but lets get real Guys don't drag race becuase there expected too we do it becuase its fun and we find out whose car is faster Guys drive different than women becuase there When a driver is driving 'unusually' I can usually figure out if it is a male or female driver without looking at the Social influences may give a person more reason to buy a vehicle that has a certain amount of character which he or she would like associated Do you change your driving habits when no one is around Sheesh I don't know what kind of women they have where you guys live but there are some ladies here who will blow your doors Or at least they will try to but we just can't let the youngsters get too uppity with us old folks My Mark jim frost Bob
