From Andrew Spencer Subject Re SHO and SC In a previous article Robert Loper says In article James Callison writes In article David Hwang writes In article wrat wharfie writes In article Chris Silvester writes Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you can't handle a stick you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real That is not to say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg disabled persons but they aren't in any position to use an SHO I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all performance type cars like the Mustangs Camaros and the like we'd cut down on the number of accidents each Autos are fine for sedate little sedans but they have no business in performance cars James I have to disagree with I have a with a and a speed auto w overdrive and it is really better that Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of I live in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be more Safety wise an auto is less would hate to have to be shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways Performance wise I can hold my own against any stock Mustang or Camaro w a five All of this all of my HO's disagree with your HO' I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my detested it in the auto like i did any other time in the Of course Dalls rush hours are nothing from what i i lived in LA i might be of a different And just for the record rarely do you shift gears when merging into is what speeds are good is good up through around most of the time so you can just wind it it's not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in fairly rare unless you drive a ferrari or some such i'd bet or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortable or when my mother is sitting in the passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way too hi Just my HO' DREW
