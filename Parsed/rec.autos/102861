From Jim Frost Subject Re Too fast wrat wharfie writes Compare either to the Porsche and you tell me which was designed Oh Only dollar cars should be driven They drive goddamn Rabbits at MPH in Europe pal and I reckon a Taurus is at least as capable as a My whole point was not to say that the cars couldn't go that fast but that they shouldn't go that A family sedan designed to be operable at doesn't suddenly become operable at because you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much larger That's what the SHO is a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful They didn't even bother improving the The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO a big power plant stuck in a mid size sedan with almost no other I have real life experience with the Mustang it handles like a brick except when you're invoking oversteer of course something I personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from Lots of accelleration but the rest of the car is not up to I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in It didn't have to be the it could have been the much cheaper or one of several Mercedes or Audi All of these cars are fairly expensive but so are the parts that make them drivable at high This should be There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought it My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand but I believe the following to be true Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than they are here and usually include animal This makes them far more predictable than most US Not all of Europe is the Most places in Europe have speed limits that aren't out of line with what we used to have in the US if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not much higher than I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing nearly h on the Autobahn but I could be Some people have no respect for their own You certainly haven't convinced Of course Speeding is Speeding is I will not I love Big You had your mind made up If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my jim frost
