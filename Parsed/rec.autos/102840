From Ron Bean Subject Re RFI Art of clutchless shifting Barking Weasel writes writes My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift If for some reason I miss the shift window I lightly press the accelerator try I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms I also skip gears some times using Sounds about I usually slip it out during throttle down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into So how did you guys learn this Is it something you were born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few times how many times I would think you'd have to have a certain amount of feel for it to begin Some people would never get it and others like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you were planning to buy a new transmission BTW I've heard that quite a few truckers and race car drivers shift this way zaphod Ron Bean uwvax astroatc nicmad madnix zaphod
