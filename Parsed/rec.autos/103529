From Christopher J Born Subject Re Mercury Villager Minivan good buy In ICJPS ASUACAD BITNET ICJPS ASUACAD BITNET writes My Nissan Quest has been doing mpg city, though its first few tanks were more like mpg The V and AT are remarkably smooth Agreed I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V and the AT In the past, I've been biased towards manual standard transmissions I owned an Aerostar with a speed, it was awesome , but settled with the AT in the Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance BTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some funny noises from the AT, I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything unusual Chris Christopher J Born
