From Chris Silvester Subject Re SHO and SC In article A Robert Loper writes In article C L rE James P Callison writes In article A David Hwang writes I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all performance type cars like the l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like we'd cut down on the number of accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans, but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO James I have to disagree with this I have a Z with a and a speed auto w overdrive, and it is really better that way Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power I live in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be more fun I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the power as it is the power they lose in the torque converter, etc Safety wise, an auto is less distracting I would hate to have to be shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here Performance wise, I can hold my own against any stock Mustang or Camaro w a five speed However, if you encounter a ' Formula with L Speed Manual, You'll be SOL, I'm afraid BTW, I know of what I speak as a former owner of a L Auto IROC and current owner of the aforementioned car Chris S Chris Silvester Any man capable of getting himself elected President should by no means be allowed to do the job Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
