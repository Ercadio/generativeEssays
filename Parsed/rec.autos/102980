From Albion Bowers Subject Re Manual Shift Bigots In a previous article Eric Youngblood says In article A eliot writes race car stuff deleted Back to the stuff for a second note that the auto' tranny in STILL shifts at the driver's command not some preselected The driver still controls the shifting not the now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are inherently more lossy than that is in my point all along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isn't skillful or One thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a I know this sounds strange but a torque converter multiplies the engine output when It functions as a sort of limited Continuously Variable Typically you get a torque multiplication of to times depending on the stall I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production Such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos that I am aware These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or fluidic Contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no TQ mult What the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's Chevy proved it many years ago with the ' Camaro ETs and terminal mile times were close enough tpo be identical for speed and auto cars Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using speed manulas now Once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the TQ multiplication effect is reduced but by then you should be on the Al Bowers DOD Alfa Ducati Hobie Kottke 'blad Iaido NASA Well goodness 't you know that girls can't play guitar Mary Chapin Carpenter
