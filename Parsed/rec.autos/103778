From kevinh Subject Re V engines In article A , Chuck Fry writes In article A Matthew R Singer writes Didn't the Saab Sonnett have a V I recall someone telling that it was something like of a Ford Not only the Sonett correct spelling , but the wagon and sedan used a cc or cc V from Ford of Germany This particular motor had a degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust ports This motor was later stretched into the V commonly seen in the Capri I think it was the reverse, the V being of the V The V could make pretty reasonable power for its size But in the Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been designed for a cylinder stroke It was also the worst engine that Ford Europe have ever made bloody awful reputation It's most successful application being the Transit van Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph half a Stag V under license I believe , but with litre capacity and perhaps a different arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight four from the Triumph
