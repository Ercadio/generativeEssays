From Barking Weasel Subject Re RFI Art of clutchless shifting writes I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter I've been doing it my self over miles on my current toyota truck I've got over I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a My experiences suggest What techniques do you use I don't use the clutch all the time I've done it with Fords BMW Datsun and Chevy and it works I can't think of any reason that it would damage the Essentially you are just doing what the synchros do anyhow match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into On some old pieces of junk I drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except To date I've driven rabbits datsuns comets fords a Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker easier they where to My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift If for some reason I miss the shift window I lightly press the accelerator try I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms I also skip gears some times using Sounds about I usually slip it out during throttle down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into krispy Jon You obviously don't know who you're dealing with Gross
