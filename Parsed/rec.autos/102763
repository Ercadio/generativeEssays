in or radio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in or radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either Crossposting between any or all of the groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your Consider setting Followup To to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must

and couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups and Followup to lines of articles before posting a In particular be wary of posting to or or any combination of these The life you save may be your Distribution There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the Distribution It may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread The distribution of is fairly As of this writing the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe Australia New Zealand and some locations in With this in mind I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution field in your article headers and on article Please take care not to send for sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes Mavericks but only door Mavericks at When posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was For example there are a number of differences between a European market Ford Escort and a US market Likewise all and early Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection European market cars usually got carbs often Webers These differences can be important to your readers make your situation Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about Use the Distribution field to limit where your article goes when Within North America the values na north america can canada and usa may be in addition the two letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey i could put ny nj in a Distribution note that multiple comma separated values are these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your The Dangers of Overgeneralization To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all

you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information if you have a question about your Honda please specify year model engine size Otherwise most answers to your question may be quite Concerning Lemons At one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even Honda admits to Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your brand x' automobile is terrible so all brand x' automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x' Such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful Concerning Flames As much as we might wish it a flame free newsgroup is something that most likely will never Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flame prone topics follows in the next section of this posting If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory don't imagine for a minute that including the words No Flames' will It won't and you'll get exactly what you If you're going to flame you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well known No one is likely to believe bald unsupported Be careful about who you choose to Consider not insulting Asking the Question It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like Please send email I don't read this group' It is a much better idea to end the question with Please send email if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later I may miss posted responses to this request' Answering the Question If

offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesn't directly address the original In general don't post in order to see your words in print and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self Stale and or Inflammatory Topics Certain topics are considered stale by old timers' while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored Some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of Some of these topics include the following the speed limit in the US Pro and Con discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar discussions over which radar detector is discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why is not a sports car' group everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car' disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's right to own and operate a radar detector Buy American' discussions clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates insert nationality here cars are terrible What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive when I
