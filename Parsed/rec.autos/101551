From Hok Chung Tsang Subject Re Saturn's Pricing Policy In article fredd shuksan Fred Dickey writes CarolinaFan uiuc wrote I have been active in defending Saturn lately on the net and would like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others' The biggest problem some people seem to be having is that Saturn Dealers make on a I think most will agree with me that the car is comparably priced with its competitors that is they aren't overpriced compared to most cars in their I don't understand the point of arguing over whether the dealer makes the or not I have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is The only thing that I can figure out is that people believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total out of pocket expenses for the While this may be true in some cases I do not believe that it is generally I bought a Saturn SL in January of ' AT THAT TIME based on studying car prices I decided that there was no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the Sure maybe I could have talked the price for some other car to the Saturn price but my out of pocket expenses wouldn't have been any What's important to me is how much money I have left after I buy the REDUCING DEALER PROFIT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAVING MONEY Show me how reducing dealer profit saves me money and I'll believe that it's My experience has been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me Fred Say you bought your Saturn at with a dealer profit of If the dealer profit is then you would only be paying for the same So isn't that saving money Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by then their cars will be even better Say if the price of a Saturn was already below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be below market It will Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM Force the competitors to lower their prices to Now not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay Isn't that saving money
