From Andrew Infante Subject Re Changing oil by self In article A Brent Woody Moss writes In article A , Steven J Orlin writes In article A ronald j deblock jr writes You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in place of the bolt I have one on both of my cars There have been no leaks in , miles combined miles on both cars Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip home But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them I personally recommend, installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep vandals away steve I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every miles Works for me, I must say Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys are really paranoid You're actually worried about somebody stealing your oil C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that That's absolutely ridiculous Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to change the oil I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and changed the oil on, my Mazda is pretty much a pain, but once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it gets easier I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine Andy Infante You can listen to what everybody says, but the fact remains ' BMW R that you've got to get out there and do the thing yourself DoD Joan Sutherland My opinions, dammit, have nothing to do with anyone else
