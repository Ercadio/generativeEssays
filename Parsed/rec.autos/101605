From Craig Powderkeg DeForest Subject Re or In article foo Brad Thone WUVMD writes Well there is a I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy but oil viscosity in general decreases with The SAE numbers are based on a typical' curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a room temperature weight at down to say that of a room temperature weight at for a typical weight Oils that are designed for operation in normal' temperatures just have a weight Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a W' tacked on the end so in winter in a cold place you'd stick in your car in the winter and in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the Modern multi viscosity oils change viscosity much less with As a result their viscosity graphs cross over several A multi vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal' operating temperature and a cold' one though I can't remember the In any event the weights do indicate a significant Remember that your engine is temperature regulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fins most of the time unless you overheat it or Any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized Thin oil won't in general lubricate as well at temperature thicker oil will like a will lubricate better at temperature but not as well during startup when most engine wear If you're planning on making long drives the is probably fine in the summer in your But if you're making short drives stick to the DON'T DRINK SOAP DILUTE DILUTE OK
