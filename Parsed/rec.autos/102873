From Craig Boyle Subject Re Too fast In article bob cos Bob Blackshaw writes In A Craig Boyle writes In article qg v Mark Hartman writes Driving in a straight line is fine, you very soon become aclimated to it It's only a rush when there are corners that you don't think you can make On a clear autobahn, is nothing In the U S of people and all judges would label you insane and it is difficult to persuade people otherwise Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc I'd have no problem driving on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at will kill you at Don't get me wrong, I love to It would have to be quite severe I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at in any decent, well damped car Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans drive quickly and they say my Probe will do , but that's more than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece of road hereabouts I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried about cops, other traffic etc than the road surface at It just isn't that fast or that dangerous If you have a Probe GT, no problem The cyl models I have driven would be likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds Craig Craig Mark Hartman Kalamazoo, MI I'm naked in the school Sleepyhead Bob
