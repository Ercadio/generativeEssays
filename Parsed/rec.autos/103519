Subject REVIEW Ford Taurus SHO From David Bonds GK I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive I GK currently have Goodyear GT s that cost the previous owner GK for four Try Eagle GAs, wear better, cost less, lose little handling, and are quieter I'm going to switch to s in my next set, with new rims Fitti Twists if I can afford 'em by the time my GAs wear out GK is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal Also, I began GK to wonder how strong that brake really is Today, I backed out of GK parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed GK the glowing brake light Oops Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in, even if you're giving it enough gas to normally move it in st You might need a brake adjustment GK The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way The same GK thing happens in my parents Mercury Sable Oddly, all the GK other windows work smoothly Watch it closely, the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor, it seems stronger in the drivers window then the others GK I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day The GK cupholders are great I've found the location under the armrest in between the seats to be a pain, but like having them They moved it into the dash pop out in the ' model year, MUCH better GK I really feel like I don't deserve this car I really can't GK believe that I could afford it I got this car ten years GK ahead of schedule I did the same thing Got a black ' with k miles on it for k in July ' GK I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as GK well as other posts with useful information on these cars I'll be GK posting this in the form of a FAQ soon Grabbed it and archived it Thanks GK If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up GK I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but GK maybe someone out there does I'll be starting one this summer, one way or the other current software I use dosen't support mailing lists, but is on the RSN list if not, I'm going to upgrade to another package that DOES have it , that is, if nobody else beats me to it Will make an announcement here when it goes up The Cutting Edge BBS cutting hou tx us A PCBoard a system Houston, Texas, USA running uuPCB
