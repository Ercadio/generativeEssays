From Daniel R Reitman, Attorney to Be Subject Re legal car buying problems In article A , Rob Boudrie writes In article stratus SWDC Stratus COM Bob Hutson writes After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new car Later that same night I noticed that the terms in the were different from the terms I had agreed to I made the stupid mistake of not checking everything on the contract This all happened last Saturday I have heard that there is a cooling off law allowing me three days to reconsider the contract Is this true Can anyone point me to the law The transaction happened at the dealership, if it matters This cooling off period applies only in certain situations lik ewhen you are solicited at home I also think the cooling off period ends if you actually accept the merchandise If this were not the case, any car buyer would have the right to return a slightly used, highly devalued, car days after buying it Yeah that's the trick if I want to buy a new car, I'd have a firend buy return one, then go in and negotiate a better deal on a pre owned used car FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY On the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed terms could be thrown out The question will be whether the agreement contains a merger clause See UCC parol evidence If we're talking about warranties, then, of course, UCC should be looked at But we have so little information that none of us can say anything conclusive Daniel Reitman The Uniform Commercial Code protects the innocent purchaser, but it is not a shield for the sly conniver, the blindly naive, or the hopelessly gullible Atlas Auto Rental Corp v Weisberg, Misc d , , N Y S d , N Y City Civ Ct
