From Aaron Lung Subject Re Changing oil by another dealer service In article John Daker writes I was worried about someone stealing my oil once I finally decided to just have my drain plug welded It works great I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every Works for me I must I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same I was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my air Oh come on Silly all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill What do you think all those big air intake things are for on those hot rod cars They're just for looks does anyone know they provide access to the oil fill Well over where we live we have problems with vandals stealing people's Those locking nuts didn't stop So to be safe and sure I welded the lug nuts to my wheels It works serious I haven't had my wheels stolen yet
