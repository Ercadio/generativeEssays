From Lawrence C Smith Subject Re please read In article Lawrence Keys writes I know that this isn't the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they haven't bombed the Waco cult Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating which was a search warrant by the way not an arrest In short perhaps because the BATF is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self defense in That will leave what four officers dead and no one to blame but the Followups directed to where the discussion has raged nearly as long as the seige and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly as Larry Smith No I don't speak for Need you ask Liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want it is the freedom to do whatever we are
