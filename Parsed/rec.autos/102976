From Roberto Landrau Subject Re Eagle Talon TSi LEMON In Jay Lorenzana U wrote Dear Netters I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon ' or ' TSi I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was I own a turbocharged one and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his her driving maintenance Question is that the ' TSi AWD was mentioned in the April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid I have been wondering about that The ' AWD models and the ' were identical except for the ABS option In particular the manual transmission Some owners had problems with the Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most The problem was not unique to the AWDs It was common to all The Galant and GSX had the same transaxle but I didn't see those listed in electrical system I don't know of any major complaints in this area except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current and brakes were below par in both models The first FWD models those built before May were recalled for brake Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a A friend of mine ownes a ' TSi AWD and he has had brake jobs pads I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day It all depends on how you It seems that most owners have been getting between on a set of one stuck valve First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars other than timing belt and some clutch transmission problem something about sticking grinding into second This doesn't seem too bad if one beats on his If your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them I am willing to suffer reliability for speed and Seems you have to pay big buck if you want all Anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your Talon and any problems you may have had and if the repairs are worth if humor impaired skip to TheEnd No matter how much you pay you won't get all Examples NSX reliability and Ferrari reliability H H H H H H yeah right speed and looks TheEnd The opinions stated above are not necessarily my employer' Roberto Landrau The MITRE Corporation Bedford MA rll
