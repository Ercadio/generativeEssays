From Mart Molle Subject Re Changing oil by Bob LaGesse writes Long silly discussion And while you're at it why bother with removing the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from there with your mouth and then spit it out This suggestion isn't as far fetched as it Years ago in another time and place I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive In many cases there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each And if you did get something there you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick There was a long thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube and another thicker shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient I'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want Mart Molle Computer Systems Research Institute University of Toronto Toronto Canada
