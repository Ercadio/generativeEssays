From Subject Weird problem with GM banger transmission I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's Before I delve into its innards I thought I'd check on the It's a Buick Skyhawk I know EFI banger auto miles When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of getting stuck in As a result when you stop for a light the motor Putting the car in park and waiting for seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to reset and go back into Otherwise it just stalls when put in My thoughts Either it the gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lock up converter is not disengaging properly seems likely The least likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum hose has broken cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from years of Please feel free to be as technical as you I'd appreciate hearing any tips suggestions offers of free grin Skoal Chris
