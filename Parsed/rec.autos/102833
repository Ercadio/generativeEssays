From Jay Lorenzana U Subject Eagle Talon TSi LEMON Dear Netters I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon ' or ' TSi Question is that the ' TSi AWD was mentioned in the April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid In particular the manual transmission electrical system and brakes were below par in both models A friend of mine ownes a ' TSi AWD and he has had brake jobs pads one stuck valve and some clutch transmission problem something about sticking grinding into second This doesn't seem too bad if one beats on his I am willing to suffer reliability for speed and Seems you have to pay big buck if you want all Anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your Talon and any problems you may have had and if the repairs are worth Thanks for any responses Jay
