From Craig Boyle Subject Re MGBs and the real world In article A Mike Brookbank writes My sister has an MGB She has one from the last year they were produced Its in very good shape I've been bugging her for years about selling it I've said over and over that she should sell it before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability Grass Roots Motorsport has a long article about MG B's this month As far as collectivity speculation is concerned they think it is a waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least desirable, a original model the most The reasons for its low value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good car Craig Which one of us is right Are there MGB affectionados out there who are still willing to pay K to K for an old MG Are there a lot out in the market Mike Brookbank, MKS King St North Director, InterOpen Sales, MKT Waterloo, Ontario Mortice Kern Systems Inc MKS Canada, N J W fax
