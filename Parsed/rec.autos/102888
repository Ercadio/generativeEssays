From Craig Boyle Subject Re Too fast In article Jim Frost writes stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO a big power The Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the plant stuck in a mid size sedan with almost no other I have real life experience with the Mustang it handles like a brick except when you're invoking oversteer of course something I Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from Lots of accelleration but the rest of the car is not up to When i think Mustang I think school bus In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at or It just isn't safe check out your local junkyard Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all ' I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in It didn't have to be the it could have been the much cheaper or one of several Mercedes or Audi All of these cars are fairly expensive but so are the parts that make them drivable at high This should be There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought it My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand but I believe the following to be true Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are True of Northern Europe latin countries are something The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than Kindof remember they were build by adolf in the ' ' they are here and usually include animal This makes them far more predictable than most US Not all of Europe is the Most places in Europe have Autobahn is the german word for Other countries have different names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway speed limits that aren't out of line with what we used to have in the US if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not much higher than Europe did seem on the brink of a It hasn't passed as far as I typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the Law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred to the US as there is no revenue enhancement The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more professional attitude to You just never see two cars running parallel at mph oblivious to all around I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing nearly h on the Autobahn but I could be Some people You're GTI's go this Just kind of noisy not the ideal autobahn A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the How do I know when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you have no respect for their own If something happens at you're dead but the same goes for much over Driving at high speed forces you to I feel much safer driving on the autobahn than in typical US traffic because most people seem to be I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn I see it all too often in the Craig It just doesn't seem fast after minutes or so of everybody drives that fast no big Craig You certainly haven't convinced Of course Speeding is Speeding is I will not I love Big You had your mind made up If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my jim frost
