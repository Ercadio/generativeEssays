From Mart Molle Subject Re Dumbest automotive concepts of all time Charles Parr writes My TOP list of dumbest automotive concepts ever Back up lights on Corvette they're on the sides of the car Sure would be interested to know what year s this was I don't seem to recall ANY car with back up lights on the sides much less any I suppose I could be mis interpreting what you are trying to say Just a quick Backup lights mounted on the side would actually be extremely useful for people backing out of parking While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights I know that Saab started using them about years My Saab didn't have them but a friend's Saab certainly In addition to the confentional tail light mounted backup lights they had another set integrated into the front turn signal For those of you who don't remember Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth about the size of a National Geographic magazine sticking out of the front fender which incorporated amber parking lights amber side marker lights reflectors white cornering lamps like American luxury cars aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on and white backup lights aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards pot holes kid's toys etc that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing Mart Molle Computer Systems Research Institute University of Toronto Toronto Canada
