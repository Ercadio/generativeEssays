From Andrew White Subject Compilation of problems Chevy Caprice My Caprice Classic with K miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e mail or post When making turns, especially when accelerating, there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of of the car Sounds like it could be the differential What could cause this Is the differential going bad I recently had the differential fluid changed, and it DID have tiny metal bits in it And no, the sound is NOT something rolling around in the trunk On starting the car, I get blue oil smoke from the exhaust for seconds Exhaust valves going bad Worn rings Anyone know whether the valves on the TBI engine can be lapped Brakes More pedal travel than I feel comfortable with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is relatively clear Pedal does NOT slowly sink to the floor when held down Pedal does not feel spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes might help could anything else cause this Tranny Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting worse takes almost seconds to downshift from rd to nd on heavy throttle application, and more recently, it is reluctant to shift from nd to rd Fluid checked with car running with tranny put through all the gears and then back to park, as per Haynes manual is red and clear, and is on full mark My springs all around are just about shot I have new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps in turns at moderate to high speed How hard are they to change Can they be reconditioned I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full size RWD owners out there with stories to tell and or advice Here in Philly, these cars are apparently stolen quite often and converted into taxis Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be junked About of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and Impalas Broughams Andrew White
