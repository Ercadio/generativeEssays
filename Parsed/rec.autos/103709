From Blair Robertson Subject Re service indicator of a BMW Derek Chan writes In article Shazad Barlas writes There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights will come back on after The tool is in fact illegal in Europe atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know of no other anyone else Shaz but the service indicators that I have works this way There are green yellow red initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go And you should get service when by the time green indicators are After service the mechanic or you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting So I expect to have a tool or a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the It's the first european car I have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to and it's a big plus But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change Any BMW owner on the net Response my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW Derek There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service It will cost you from a mailorder and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it Why is reseting so important The only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every ' Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape and extending its life will change it every inc filter Don't wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the I bought a bmw about months ago it had green lights I have changed the oil every completly flushed brake fliud changed all filters oil air and fuel changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service and a service After nearly miles I am still on green After a winter in Burlington and it is snowing today that is not Good luck Blair Blair Robertson A New Zealander in Vermont University of Vermont posting his own Medical Research Facilty Smooth Muscle Ion Channel Group Colchester Vermont email Telephone
