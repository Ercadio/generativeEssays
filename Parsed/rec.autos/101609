From Daniel U Holbrook dh q andrew cmu edu Subject Re Did US drive on the left The reason I ask is because I went to a classic car meet here in the UK, and saw a very nice old De Soto, 's vintage I'd guess, with wooden artillery type wheels, etc, but it was right hand drive I can't believe that DeSoto produced RHD cars just for the UK Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the wrong side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK i'm guessing, but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts I am fairly sure that placement of the steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time By the s, there was a very active good roads movement, which had its origins actually in the s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens witness the Linclon Highway Association, or so, and the US highway support act real name something different in that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense Anyway, by the s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc Two good books on the subject spring to mind Warren Belasco America on the Road title may not be exact author is and another called The Devil Wagon in God's Country author I forget Also, any of John Flink's or John Bell Rae's auto histories As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why Dan Carnegie Mellon University Applied History World history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe, whether we can comprehend and prove it or not Oswald Spengler
