From Derek Chan Subject Re service indicator of a BMW In article Shazad Barlas writes There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights will come back on after The tool is in fact illegal in Europe atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know of no other anyone else About changing oil every thats on newer Audis they only require it after every miles I am talking about an oil change Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden acceleration etc If yeah then the M oil change seems quite But if you drive kinda I'd get a bit up tight abot that thingy a point to note just because the first light came on at doesn't mean all the others will come on every too Shaz but the service indicators that I have works this way There are green yellow red initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go And you should get service when by the time green indicators are After service the mechanic or you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting So I expect to have a tool or a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the It's the first european car I have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to and it's a big plus But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change Any BMW owner on the net Response my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW Derek
