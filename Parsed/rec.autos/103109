From Robert Loper Subject Re SHO and SC In article C L rE James P Callison writes In article A David Hwang writes In article unisql UUCP wrat unisql UUCP wharfie writes In article chrissC qB D B netcom com Chris Silvester writes Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg disabled persons , but they aren't in any position to use an SHO anyway I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all performance type cars like the l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like we'd cut down on the number of accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans, but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO James I have to disagree with this I have a Z with a and a speed auto w overdrive, and it is really better that way Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power I live in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be more fun Safety wise, an auto is less distracting I would hate to have to be shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here Performance wise, I can hold my own against any stock Mustang or Camaro w a five speed All of this IMHO Robert L Loper Infinity is a notion best contemplated ROBERTLL FLOPN dseg ti com in a warm bed Texas Instruments, Inc My opinions are my own, not TI's
