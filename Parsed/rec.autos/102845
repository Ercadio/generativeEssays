From FRED BACH Subject Re Auto air conditioning without Freon In article Chris BeHanna In article writes In article Chris BeHanna writes Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society MACS that is the people who stand to rake in that to per retrofit per automobile have mounted an organized campaign to squash those substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very shaky technical grounds at best on outright lies at worst Now I'm not saying you're wrong because I know that the R substitutes exist but this sounds a lot like the carbs that the oil companies keep us all from It sounds crazy but it's One of the best R subsitutes GHG is currently a commercial Unfortunately the SAE committee on mobile air conditioning is comprised almost exclusively of MACS Such being the case no papers about any alternative refrigerant other than R have been accepted for review Yo John You want to provide some more details Or should I just repost your voluminous repost Later Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX needs a name agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn We here are VERY interested in info on substitutes in fact I think we really need all the info on this we can get I would really appreciate technical supply and hardware upgrade Also is a useful solvent reagent in the extraction production of certain Any info on the substitutes' corresponding usefullness I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do not what you should do I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol which has a definite CFC phase out Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone depleting CFC chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse gas producing The greenhouse effect produced by infrared trapping gasses like and methane and the ozone hole problem produced by long lived chlorine containing molecules are not the same It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's chloro fluorocarbons than it is to stop producing and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse gas problem but would do nothing for the ozone Fred Bach Operations Group Internet TRIUMF TRI University Meson Facility Voice loc WESBROOK MALL UBC CAMPUS FAX University of British Columbia Vancouver CANADA These are my opinions which should ONLY make you read think and They do NOT necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow
