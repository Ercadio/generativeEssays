From Chuck Kesler Subject Re Ford Probe Opinions centered around the GT In article nathanp Nathan writes Jeremy Mereness zonker says Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc I am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more I am considering the MX Probe Accord Corolla and the I bought a ' Probe GT with the PEP last July now at miles after debating over the Sentra SE R MR Stealth Prelude and The car design is different than earlier years so it's too early to see its reliability so For what it's worth my comments My dislikes Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind Some other owners on the mailing list have commented about this problem but I haven't seen it happen on my month old ' Probe I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since the initial batch of Also someone said that Ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix Headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain Haven't seen any of these problems nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with crammed engine little hope for do it yourselfers typical Definitely parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched Hopefully just a No problems like these I haven't been able to find any obvious places where they screwed Ford only gives key with the C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies Hmmm I got two keys with my Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on Actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owner's binder I got keys but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet I guess I won't count Rear hatch has no padding on corners when I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference The latter is probably because of the air It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding The previous Probes had Japanese Tires fling dirt mud onto side of car Yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying My Likes engine design valves sounds smoothness power mileage torque definitely handling very good for FWD understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere Very little torque steer at full power much better than the ' SHO I drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front Heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather ABS Air bag see above rear seats fold down I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important No shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still Tires Goodyear Eagles left hoping for I agree strongly with all of the above especially about the The interior is very very nice Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like When you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is Yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for I personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX If you have passengers by all means bring them along They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently if that's better is up to you The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg Plenty of head room Shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their Also there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the My back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the I really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then I've always been a sucker for open air No leakage problems or anything like I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works I haven't heard about this I know that some of the very early Probes ' and maybe ' had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which Ford will replace at no charge but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the ' I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my I was quite happy with the way they considering that I was expecting the worst from them From what I've heard it sounds like Ford Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe and probably MX when they first went into production but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this Hope this
