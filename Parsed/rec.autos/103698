From jack wood Subject Re Chevy GMC x Fullsize Pickups, Opinions Dick Grady wrote I am considering buying a Chevy or GMC x full size pickup with the extended cab Any opinions about these vehicles Have there been any significant problems Dick Grady Salem, NH, USA So many newsgroups, so little time I bought a brand new Chevrolet K HD x extended cab last May It has had many, many problems See my earler post that describes the situation I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me If you do get one, stay away from the speed manual with the deep low first gear They have put three of them in my truck so far After about , miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly There is no way to fix them Chevrolet says that the noise is a characteristic of the transmission Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck On a steep hill, you get up to about MPH in second gear at , RPM yellow line If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only , , and you begin to loose speed I should point out that the V they put in the HD GVW trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for engine longevity reasons So the light duty may pull better than my truck does Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan times so far , paint had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering , and suspension parts link between stabilizer and control arm fell off Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included What really bothered me was the way they reacted They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time So I bought a brand new Ford F HD Super Cab with a and an automatic I will never buy another Chevrolet
