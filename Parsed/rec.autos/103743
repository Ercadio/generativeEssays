From David Hwang Subject Re Best Radar Detector VALENTINE In article Allen Tobias writes In article Troy Wecker writes Each Valentine is hand tuned to maximum performance is all the radar bands of coverage this of course adds to the labor cost and in turn the cost of the I live in the backyard of the folks who make the Stalker radar The Valentine has saved me many many many times from the stealth revenue enhancement traps of the local I have had all the major brand detectors and IMHO nothing else even comes close to the I don't work for Valentine I am just a satisfied user of their unit If you really want the nitty gritty details on all this call the nice folks at Valentine They will be more than happy to explain their perspective on radar detection and analysis The calls free AT It seems that there are more and more bands available for police radar each I have recently purchased within the last months the BEL While it is not a perfect detector by any means it does do the job fairly Now however I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands X K Ka photo Ka wideband as well as the new Super Ka Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs for the average home consumer at least it seems that there is now the same concern with radar Does it make sense to upgrade just months after purchasing my new detector Is Valentine upgrading their equipment If so it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new I hope that the flood of new radar bands ceases with this new Super Wideband Allen Tobias Technical email Convex Computer Marketing Waterview Parkway Richardson TX No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care David Hwang
