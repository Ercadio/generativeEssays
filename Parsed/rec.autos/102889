From Srihari Shoroff Subject Re Instead of a Saturn SC , What In Ifn sPO iV A NZ andrew cmu edu jr q andrew cmu edu Jason M Roth writes R T had an article on cars of the SC ilk and they liked the Civic Ex, the Escort GT and the MX best of all, and the SC was way down the list except for braking I just looked at that article first of all, this summary is inaccurate of cars, the SC was th, right behind these mentioned and the Suzuki Swift As has been pointed out, it was a semi silly comparison the Saturn was at least cheaper than the MX and Escort admittedly negligible, but an issue , and less than the Honda The stated goal was a base under k the Honda was over, while the SC at the same price was excluded In other words, they let the best Honda play, but not the best Saturn Note that the Saturn did beat the k I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the MX and Escort and maybe even the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others will do it way below sticker Srihari
