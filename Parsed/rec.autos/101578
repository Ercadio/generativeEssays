From Tom Shou Subject Ford Explorer do I need performance axle We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with and we have the following questions All we would do is go skiing no off roading With do we need the performance axle limited slip axle Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires are on different Do we need the all terrain tires or will the all season be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe Thanks Tom Tom Shou Silicon Graphics Shoreline MS fax Mountain View CA
