From Hiroki Kimata Subject Re Open letter to NISSAN In qideqINN Steven A Morris writes Hey, NISSAN, why aren't you guys making any station wagons You used to make a wagon on every platform SENTRA, STANZA, MAXIMA and now NONE AT ALL In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U S Sunny California is a l wagon based on Sentra Avenil is a l WD WD wagon It looks like Infinity G but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon I mean, it's not based on any sedans Nissan had better consider to sell them here After buying my SE R and really loving it, I would like to buy another NISSAN product for my wife but prefer a wagon I've owned minivans and don't prefer them How about an ALTIMA wagon or a sentra wagon would do Sounds nice But I doubt they have a plan Coz Avenil was introduced to replace any sedan based wagon or, here's an even better suggestion, why don't you guys go ahead and buy the rest of Fuji Heavy Industries Subaru and put either an in line or V into the LEGACY WD wagon I'd buy the Legacy in a minute if it had a Nissan engine instead of the Horizontal that they seem sentimentally attached to With all the Camry, Accord, Taurus, Volvo and Subaru wagons out there it's got to be a market segment that would be worthwhile I can wait a year or two but if you don't have something to compete by the model I may have to go elsewhere Thanks Steve Morris, M A Internet Addiction Studies Pgm uucp uw beaver,uunet gtenmc dataio sumax smorris Seattle University Phone dept or direct Seattle, WA
