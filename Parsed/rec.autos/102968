From Jim Frost Subject Re Too fast Craig Boyle writes The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc They light the highways in Texas Funny, everywhere else I've been they only light 'em at junctions I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially nonexistant than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at will kill you at Don't get me wrong, I love to It would have to be quite severe I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at in any decent, well damped car I suspect you have very limited experience US freeways vary dramatically, particularly between states I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where would be very optimistic in any car I'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but I suspect every single bridge junction on I through CT would be considered so They're hard to take at mph That's not the only interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive frequently Texas is pretty much an edge case you can't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such wide open spaces It just ain't so jim frost
