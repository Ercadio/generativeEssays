From Thad McCulloch Subject Re Autos dealer In article lam thanh writes I got a price quote of for a Camry w ABS from a Toyota dealer in I came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase Then I was told that the salesperson made an error in I walked out of that I wonder if this kind of practice is common with Toyota dealers Is the price quote written on the salesperson's business card binding I would appricate any I had a similar We had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these no haggle Toyota dealers for a Camry XLE w ABS leather The price seemed fair but when we went in to take them up on their offer they discovered that certain extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written It would have totaled an extra and in spite of the fact that we had a written quote they said there was nothing they could Bottom line quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they don't have to We walked went out and bought a new LH car Eagle Vision TSI and I don't regret it one bit Thad McCulloch
