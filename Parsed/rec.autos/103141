From U Subject Re Best Radar Detector VALENTINE I've had a Valentine for about months now and I agree that it is the best det ector The point here is trust and I've been able to tr ust the Valentine more than any other detector I've If the Valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then it's mo re than likely to be a speed With my other detectors I've gotten so many falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas That directional indicator really really Plus more info is almost alwa ys better than less No matter how smart radar detectors get the human br ain is usually So if I'm going to make a decisio based on information at hand I want all the info I can Plus if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar With other detectors yo u'll just get one strong My logic may be faulty on this but I think i t works Although I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of one radar Thomas
