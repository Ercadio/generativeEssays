From Andrew Krenz Subject Re Impala SS going into production In Apr ucsu Colorado EDU dunnjj ucsu Colorado EDU DUNN JONATHAN JAMES writes Andrew Krenz writes I personally like the looks of the Impala SS The Caprice was definately weird looking until this year when they made the rear wheel openings look more like a normal car, but the Impala impresses me GM can't exactly shove the LT in everything they make, you know, only the bigger stuff I'd like to see it next in a series pickup That would be a hot setup What about in a full size Blazer as well Would this engine have the gobs of torque necessary for off roading If so, this would be even better than the Syclone Well, an LT Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its too heavy As it is right now, the normal HP engine has plenty of power for a full size Blazer Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the LT in it It seems like they have a real winner with that engine Why spend so much more money into getting a valve DOHC V when you can take an LT It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG for a , that is talking about Impala SS Will this be in the door Caprice body I'm just curious if Chevy is trying to resurrect their door muscle cars, or to compete with the European super sedans Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered door Caprice riding on aluminum rims and Eagle GS C tires The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ read plush police package with horsepower I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get their DOHC V and not the LT Jon Dunn Andrew Krenz
