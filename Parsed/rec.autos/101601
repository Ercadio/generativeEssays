From The Devil Reincarnate Subject Re Was Re Safety From how far can you see a car In article Mark R Poulson writes The Devil Reincarnate writes You will be surprised at the number of people who forget their glasses while And then there are the people who just plain don't get their eyes checked once a As someone who has lousy vision I can see objects at a distance without my However they are quite fuzzy and I may not be able to make out the But I can certainly tell that SOMETHING is I won't argue too much about I am probably one of those that think that we can't have enough safety on the I would gladly sacrifice distractions as you call it than someone having trouble seeing danger One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of distractions for And then there is dawn and When your eyes have not yet adjusted to the poor And there are those who drive black grey And then there is the case where you are driving down a two way one lane road and someone is overtaking cars and coming the opposite direction doesn't see you because your lights are not Or vice At that is quite a small reaction But of course we are too macho to think we are invincible and can react faster than Only the poor sod who you didn't see might not have a normal life I worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its PLENTY even for an year old grandma as long as speeds are in the MPH range or If you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be As always you are responsible for your driving If you pull out to pass and crash into someone for whatever reason its YOUR If you can't Problem is that I may just kill the I agree that I would be at fault and I will have my license revoked why I might even go to the gas But the fact still remains that the guy is Someone died because I was too stingy to put on my see a damn thing then you shouldn't be driving lights fail fallen trees or rocks don't have lights I maintain that headlight strength The ratio of the probability of fallen trees rocks on the roads to oncoming traffic is too low to even be The difference is also working on what we know could happen to what might running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around It may be a good idea to force the running or headlights on when you turn your windshield wipers on but only because some people are too stupid to do If you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court to show his neglegence if you can even prove it Just out of curiosity how much gas milage do you loose when you put your lights on And how much do you reduce the life of your head lamps And what is the cost of your headlamps anyway Mileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probably about watts for head and running lights This is an extra horsepower that must be made by the It may be that this will cost you around two gallons a But times million cars that's a lot of Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those million cars it is miniscule 'tis a pity I have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with S Lamp life is measured in So if you normally drive in half daylight and half night your lamps will have to be replaced twice as Headlamps only cost about for most halogen The cost to the individual is trivial and to me is not the What I don't like is the distractions all these cars with headlights I don't need to constantly see the headlights of the vehicle behind I don't need to see the headlights of every gosh darn car for a mile down the These lit up cars make non illuminated things LESS visible like pedistrians and bikes Hopefully we're not going to mandate DRL's for people and bikes A stream of taillights is tolerable as are the orange front running This is certainly sufficient for other people to see you if they look and doesn't distract me nearly as much as full power Mark
