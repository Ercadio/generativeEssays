From COM Don Graham Subject Re JEEP WRANGLER OPINI In article qht eINN , Tom Vervaeke writes I have had two Wranglers, and still have the second right now It's a Wrangler Base model with the big I L engine, hard top, no power steering or air conditioning Runs like a top Has about k on it Has never been in the shop I can change my own oil nice tall vehicle I can lube it myself fittings I occasionally take it to Jiffy Lube to check the differentials and do the oil change there My previous Wrangler had nary a problem either Here in Colorado there' more Jeeps than BMW's, Mercedes, Volvos, and the like together In fact Jeep has been called the Colorado Car for a while They hold their value well, and are very easy to resell Mine cost right around K new Of course, I didn't blow money on an Islander, Sahara, or Renegade which I have a Wrangler Sahara and paid new including the rebate are just Wranglers with fancy inside stuff After driving a CJ for years, that fancy stuff is pretty nice The cars are primitive, ride like a dump truck, etc But if you live in an area that gets around of snow per winter, you'd have one too They'll go anywhere with a winch and are easy to get parts for The I like my Wrangler, but when doing some serious off roading, it can't keep up with a CJ because of ground clearance and limited suspension travel I do have a winch and would like to get an ARB air locker in the future L engine puts out HP and gets around mpg Not bad I love the Just my experience I'm sure there are bad ones out there, but that goes for any make and model Don Graham
