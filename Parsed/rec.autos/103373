From george howell George Howell Subject RE THE MUSTANG The current l V will soldier on for about two years A version of the valve modular V in the Mark VIII could be offered then How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which and Fords and and Chevys can be built up Still, it will provide a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new Firebird Camaros It wouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a litre in the Mustang We all know that the current is really litres anyway Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro Firebird, IMO I must agree I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his Formula Firebird for a paltry , without even telling me The bastard George Howell george howell
