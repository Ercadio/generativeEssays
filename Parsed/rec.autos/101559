From Craig Boyle Subject Re Basics about maintenance In article A Joe Staudt writes In article piip hubertc whistle CS Berkeley EDU Hung Hsien Hubert Chang writes Hi being new to a car owner, I would pretty much like to know more about some basics of maintaining the cars I know the following Oil has to be changed every miles Change the oil filter, too Check tires before going on the high way And fill up the tank Make that monthly, or more often if you know one or more of your tires has a slow leak If the tire has a leak you should fix it What others Thank you Check ALL fluids regularly every month , check the oil every time you fill up with gas Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the oil when the engine is cool, i e not when you are at a gas station Craig
