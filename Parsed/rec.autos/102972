From Joe Staudt Subject Re Trading in a car that's not paid for Pointers Please In article fibercom COM Rhonda Gaines writes I'm planning on purchasing a new car and will be trading in my ' Mazda MX DX I've still got more years to pay on it How does that get taken into account when I purchase my new car Does the dealership pay off my car and add on the amount they had to pay to the purchase price of the new car someone please explain this to me If you don't already know it, you should call the bank credit union finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the payoff amount from the trade in the dealer is giving you If this turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal Subtract this difference from the price of the new car This is the size of the loan you will need for the new car The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out of the money you give them when you pick up your new car At least that's how it worked for me years ago in Ohio thanks rhonda Joseph Staudt, Telxon Corp P O Box Usenet is like Tetris for people who still Akron, OH remember how to read x J Heller
