From THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO Subject Re MR noisy engine Eliot is right about liter engine in the second and last generation MR 's But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR If it's a first generation car like my ' , it has liter engine or perhaps same engine with a supercharger, if it's ' ' The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes, my simply makes noise Not all that annoying, mind you But you hear it well when the engine is right behind your left ear Mike S Sorry 'bout that Mine is a ' model non turbo with ABS and revised suspension whatever revised means I'm in Australia, so we always seem to get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as standard My query is, why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about months after an oil change I just find it a bit wierd that this happens Is it the oil I'm using Mobil or is it the engine the S GE version model ie gets noiser the older the oil is I'm only guessing Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling Puzzled
