From David Hwang Subject Re Best Radar Detector VALENTINE In article Troy Wecker writes Let me explain why I feel the bogey counter feature is a Radar waves bounce off objects especially That is how radar speed measurement A high frequency microwave X band approx GHz and K is approx GHz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other If an object is moving a Doppler shift about Hz per MPH on X Band occurs is measured and converted to miles per These waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many From what I understand the Valentine can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or There are only two If they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey Bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument but don't you answer your own question Is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected If so wouldn't it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources Here is the Since the microwaves reflect how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection Take a Valentine and drive to the local grocery store that uses an X Band radar door You can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a degree angle and your detector going off when it gets The Valentine will count or bogeys from all directions front rear and sides it doesn't say which side The count changes as cars drive by and reflections Is there or sources Not at the store I go As I drive around with a standard detector I can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front Troy Wecker Sequent Computer Systems Beaverton OR David Hwang
