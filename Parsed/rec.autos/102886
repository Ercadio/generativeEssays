From Gary Lorman Subject Re electronic odometers was Used BMW Question In article Daniel Lovall writes In article CONRADIE CONRADIE Gerrit Conradie writes However if I were to design a BMW's electronics I will use a counter to count the number of times the car passed million miles or whatever and store it in the car computer's This could be read when doing a diagnostics Ditto for the date of the As easy as this is I don't know why manafucturers don't do it don't they to prevent illegal odometer But as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving It will be easier to reprogram How I don't It shouldn't be THAT hard if you know much about digital If the counter is made with standard TTL chips all you should need to do is find the chip s used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to low high you'd also have to know what the conventions are for low and high It might be a little more involved than this but it shouldn't be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using a translation table stored in selah Dan But those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and use less power and the preset data pins are not going to be It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make much Plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy Good garyl Any shark that gets to be or feet long with big teeth can be considered dangerous 'Shark Bowl ' '
