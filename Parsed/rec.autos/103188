From Jim Frost Subject Re Is car saftey important John F Nielsen writes In article r jr Jim Frost writes Trevor Corkum writes I figure that mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are lots of low speed collisions that do worry me Get into an mph accident and you may reconsider I've been in one and it is really scarey My life is something I value more than a car's looks or handeling Consider it insurance, it may not happen often but when it does, you'll sure be glad you got a safe car Granted the tests aren't perfect but I'd much rather be in a car that did well in the test than a car that did horribly You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection and other luxuries but you'll pay significantly more for it In my case it's out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget Even in high speed head on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old point seatbelt Nowadays, at least in the US, you get an airbag if you get a point belt so presumably you get an added safety benefit there as well That's something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars My , of course jim frost
