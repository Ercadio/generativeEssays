From Mihir Pramod Shah Subject Re new saturn argument In article Robert Wade writes ok how about this to argue why does the have a much lower base price than the it's over cheaper i forget the exact amount doesn't it cost more to have the extra doors windows locks motors that are in the door perhaps it is just a marketing want the so they will pay the extra Ok here's what I understand The SL was meant to compete with the following cars Honda Civic Toyota Tercel SL Toyota Corolla Nissan Sentra Mazda Protoge' Subaru Loyale Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth Dodge Colt Their core competition is the Civic Corolla and Most of the other models are in the same class but aren't the first cars you would think I threw in the Escort Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier Sunbird Shadow Sundance Tempo and Topaz since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese The was meant to compete against the following cars Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si Civic Coupes del Sol Si Nissan Mazda MX Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at the prices of these cars they're more expensive than they're door The is good reason for It is a more upscale and trend driven Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms their interior is good enough to warrant slightly higher Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of Tercel Paseo Sentra Civic del Sol MX not sure on this one Stylus Impulse Storm To illustrate a Tercel starts at around while the Paseo starts at around Even a door Tercel will cost less than a door Now you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some doors What I mean is that there is no dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe Let's take another example the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS Storm Both have the same powerplants a engine but the smaller dr coupes are generally more Again this is because the two door sport coupe market is a more fashion oriented and trend setting People are willing to pay more money for this type of In short even though the may be smaller hence less car it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan I hope this clears things up a Mihir Shah
