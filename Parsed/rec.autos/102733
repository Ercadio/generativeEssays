From Ken Buck Subject Re Do trains have radar writes I came upon a train parked on a trestle with its locomotive sitting directly over the northbound Just as I passed from underneath the trestle my radar detector went into full alert all lights lit and all chirps beeps and buzzes going Could this have been caused by the train's radio or what recently manufactured locomotives have wheel slip detection systems that use frequencies shared with police radar i forget which band these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough though i believe the range is pretty BTW railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains just like regular police check for speeding cars although the intent here is for safety not revenue collection unlike with cars
