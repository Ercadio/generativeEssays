From Donald Wendel Subject Compilation of problems AW My Caprice Classic with K miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e mail or post AW When making turns, especially when accelerating, there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of of the car Sounds like it could be the differential Wheel bearing, ujoint AW On starting the car, I get blue oil smoke from the exhaust for seconds Exhaust valves Bad valve stem seals AW Brakes More pedal travel than I feel comfortable with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is Worn pads, rear brakes not adjusted up tight or worn out drums of low pedal complaints usually are from a rear brake problem AW Tranny Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting worse takes almost seconds to downshift from rd to nd on heavy throttle application, and more recently, it is reluctant to shift from nd to rd Fluid checked with car running with tranny put through all the gears and then back to park, as per Haynes manual is red and clear, and is on full mark Possible modulator valve if equipped with one Also could be the kickdoen cable AW My springs all around are just about shot I have new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps in turns at moderate to high speed How hard are they to change Can they be reconditioned Difficult on front Easy on rear They are not expensive about for front and less than for the rear Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the proper equipment Don SLMR a I put spot remover on my dog Spots gone Ye Olde Bailey BBS V bis V bis Houston,Texas yob sccsi com Home of alt cosuard
