From Shazad Barlas Subject Re Thoughts on the VW Corrado In the EC the Corrado is rated as 'best handling car this side of a ' As it goes I just read an article in 'Autocar Motor' comparing the to a Ford Probe later to be launched in the UK The is more powerful even more so coz its instead of in the EC and more fun to drive etc but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine thanx Mazda They sum it up as 'both cars are fast the is a bit more exhilirating to drive but only if you're prepared to work harder'
