From Shazad Barlas Subject Re Thoughts on the VW Corrado VR In the EC, the Corrado VR is rated as 'best handling car this side of a ' As it goes, I just read an article in 'Autocar Motor' comparing the VR to a Ford Probe later to be launched in the UK The VR is more powerful even more so coz its instead of in the EC and more fun to drive etc etc but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine thanx Mazda MX They sum it up as 'both cars are fast the VR is a bit more exhilirating to drive but only if you're prepared to work harder' Shaz
