from tyson f nuss subject re dumbest automotive concepts of all tim in article , wrote > >> 8. saab 900 - ignition is on floor!?! actually, this started as a great idea. before steering-column
locks became popular, saab installed a *gearshift* lock -- put the car
in reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse! also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and
demands your keys at gunpoint. you hand them over, he gets in, and
has no idea where to put the key! at this, he will run away (or perhaps
shoot you anyway %-}). i heard this actually happened somewhere... btw, i hear that the saab 900's new successor will have the
ignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs. %\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%\%
