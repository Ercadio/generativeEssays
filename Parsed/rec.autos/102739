From Larry Rogers Subject Re Saturn Manual Transmission Problem I had exactly the same problem with a Third gear would just Engine would rev Kind of I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not If the lemon law had been in place then that car would have been I have had several Jap cars since then figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first Anyway from that day forward I have sworn that I would never purchase another American car with a American manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more However I hate automatics so I am still buying Jap Not sure this is any help but other cars do this Cheers Larry Larry Rogers Big Brother is Watching Data General The opinions contained herein are my own and do not reflect the opinions of Data General or anyone else but they Sometimes we are the windshield sometimes we are the bug Dire Straits
