From Andrew Spencer Subject Re Manual Shift Bigots In a previous article Doug Zolmer says In article kissane John Kissane writes As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while here in Europe they are rare Just In many of our cities there are traffic signals every feet unsynchronised of course well here in Ottawa anyway and the roads are so congested that shifting manually is a real pain in the left Also most Canadians are too stupid to learn how to shift manually gee I gotta co ordinate my two feet on the clutch brake and accelerator and I gotta steer shift and operate the signals optional and radio with my two it i agree wholeheartedly can't be done Also most North American made cars come with the automatic as standard equipment so why bother with a manual when the car can shift for you for no addition not sure about there in CA but here in US the manuals are quite often the standard Of course FINDING a car with one might be hard but if you read the sticker on the window there is usally an additional or so tacked on for that lousy So you actually ARE paying more just that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped standard this applies to MOST cars but not to the caddilac licolns DREW
