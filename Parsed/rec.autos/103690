From eliot Subject Re horizontally opposed boxer engines was V V V V Vx In article A Brian J Queiser writes None of the configurations are perfectly inherently balanced, which is what I was talking about Balance shafts and mass on either ends of the cranks can eliminate these forces moments, which is something I also pointed out and didn't you also say that it was easier to add masses than to add balance shafts the sad truth is that some makers don't bother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 's The three cranks I refer to i i I even firing deg k j Fp Mp Fs R L Zcos T Ms j j Flat even firing deg k i Fp Mp Fs a crank spacing Ms a R L Zcos T j j Flat even firing deg k i Fp Mp aZcosT Fs Ms how about if this is ridiculous, kindly explain why it's been more than years since i studied this stuff Flat s and I s both have the potential to be nearly vibration free Because Subaru does that has nothing to do with I s in general or Porsche I think Subaru somehow connecting themselves to Porsche is an absurdity, and I'm not a Porsche fan Big wing dings These configurations, overhead cams, etc, etc, etc, have been around for nearly years the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles for the orthodox inline , they are using a horizontally opposed , which is unique in that market segment and porsche also uses a flat six in their , so what's the problem i don't see any claim that their engine is as good as a porsche's they are simply pointing out that they use the same configuration as a porsche if you want to nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than this eliot
