From Jason Chen Subject LH Workmanship I just visited the NY Auto Show and saw two LH cars on the floor Eagle Vision and Dodge Really nice I must Very attractive styling lots of features and room at a competitive Unfortunately the workmanship is quite On BOTH cars the rubber seals around the window and door fell It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door Surely it would come off I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering assembly problems that will show up I may still consider buying it but only when it establishes a good track Jason Chen
