From aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer Subject Re Too fast In a previous article, James P Callison says In article qn ev g usenet INS CWRU Edu aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer writes In a previous article, wrat unisql UUCP wharfie says In article qkon Jim Frost writes larger engine That's what the SHO is a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine They didn't even bother improving the brakes That shows how much you know about anything The brakes on the SHO are very different inch or I forget discs all around, vented in front The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front, drums rear one i saw had vented rears too it was on a lot of course, the sales man was a fool titanium wheels yeah, right then later told me they were magnesium more believable, but still crap, since Al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good i tend to agree, tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard for running on a regular basis The brakes should be bigger, like or so take a look at the ones on the Corrados where they have braking regulations Well, let's see my T Bird SC has a computer controlled adjustable suspension, wheel ABS disks vented front, rear , point belts, sturdy passenger compartment, aerodynamics good enough for NASCAR without too much change, hp ft lb supercharged l V , wheel independent suspension plus limited slip differential , with a top speed in excess of mph, and rides on V rated tires I have yet to find R s in any other speed rating Is that up to standard If not, why not James james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts never was a t'bird mentioned The discussion was about SHO's and 'stangs not being up to spec I do not know about t'birds I only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff This does not in any way disencourage me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it a bad car It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra bit of safety and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large enough for them to fit if memory serves right, which it may very well not and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it c ya DREW
