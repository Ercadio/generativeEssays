From Frank Reid Subject Re The Kuebelwagen In article C K Co F Tommy Hwang writes Sorry for the mis spelling, but I forgot how to spell it after my series of exams and NO on hand reference here Is it still possible to get those cute WWII VW Jeep wanna be's A replica would be great I think TKH ' The VW Thing Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and possibly South America Good luck importing one They probably don't meet US safety and pollution requirements There are mechanics and junkyards which specialize in VW they might be helpful for finding a Thing unless the WWII re enacters have grabbed them all The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep, but was not wheel drive One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky, also the rare Schwimwagen sp amphibious version, in full scale dioramas Highly recommended Frank
