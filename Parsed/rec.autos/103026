From Frank Reid Subject Re The Kuebelwagen In article Tommy Hwang writes Sorry for the mis spelling but I forgot how to spell it after my series of exams and NO on hand reference Is it still possible to get those cute WWII VW Jeep wanna be's A replica would be great I TKH ' The VW Thing Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and possibly South Good luck importing one They probably don't meet US safety and pollution There are mechanics and junkyards which specialize in VW they might be helpful for finding a Thing unless the WWII re enacters have grabbed them The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep but was not wheel One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox Kentucky also the rare Schwimwagen sp amphibious version in full scale Highly recommended Frank
