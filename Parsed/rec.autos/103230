From Robert J Wade Subject Re Saturn's Pricing Policy In article qn m writes I just ordered a Saturn SL after considering a few imports Frankly, the Saturn stuff deleted Saturn also has a good extended warranty program for year K miles, fully refunded if you don't use it That works out to an actual cost of or so, based on the year treasury rates Using savings account rates it's more like In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund mike in general extended warranties are a ripoff this yr k is really only yr k because you get the yr k one free with the car also, is there perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty also, are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty and if you use it at year for some buck job and pay a deduct and then you have used it so no refund ever again, extended warranties are ripoff, high profit items for the dealer
