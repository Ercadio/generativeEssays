From John Navitsky Subject Re Ford Probe Opinions centered around the GT In article Bill Heiser writes In article Chuck Kesler writes Jeremy Mereness zonker says Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc I've found mine ' Probe GT to do quite window problem deleted artical has been trimmed I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer where I purchased the car the first time they made this problem The second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford probe mailing list they said they didn't know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much However it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when I open close the window in wet weather anyone elses's do this I've not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but do get the squeal that Bill I live in Seattle so the wet weather may be a Ford only gives key with the C'mon Ford spend an extra few pennies If I recall correctly I got two horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference you've got to position the fingers perfectly to make it beep buttons are This is I'm wondering if this may be a safety IE if people pound on the place where the airbag Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding The previous Probes had Japanese No transmission the speed is a must I have always been a speed Almost every car I've ever owned has been a Because I got a good deal on this car with the miles I knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an But it is a pretty high tech It is a fully electronicaly controlled speed with The speed is much more We opted for the automatic for a number of reasons but it's still fun and in some ways more No shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still Shakes and rattles has been my main I've gotten them to fix the worst of them but I fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets I too would suspect that this may be Tires Goodyear Eagles left hoping for very very very It sticks to the road like glue even on a rough Yes interior is very very nice Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically Ford Mazda did a very very nice job on this The car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to Yes this car's stiff suspension isn't for I personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX Check it I don't mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be a How about the ' RX for suspension Well I wouldn't encourage passenger carrying in the Probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the As mentioned in the Consumer Reports write ups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf No biggie to me though if it had been I'd not have bought the car but it's definitely not a family car I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works I haven't heard about this I know that some of the very early Probes ' and maybe ' had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which I've had this problem and read about or at least I assume the one I had was the one I read about In any case what happened was the weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so I'm not a mechanic In my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and put them on when they got I suspect this is some sort of design flaw or production In any case I have an earlier model and would expect it to be worked out on newer In any case it is a warrantee or they get the keys back From what I've heard it sounds like Ford Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe and probably MX when they first went into production but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this I have to agree that they seem to have some QC But I seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very I second There seems to be some things that slipped through but the car seems very While not perfection what is you get an awful lot for your Bill Heiser Boston University Boston MA BTW Bill has a Probe mailing You might want to subscribe to it if you are interested in more Try did I get that right never can remember if the request goes on the front or the back John Navitsky Exercise a right today
