From Jason Chen Subject MILITECH I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show and would like to hear your MILITECH tm is yet another oil But the demonstration of this product really impressive if it didn't The setup of the demo is fairly A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor The rotor is powered by an electronic A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque Before MILITECH was added the rotor was stopped with about lb ft of torque You pick the brand of oil no difference Once MILITECH was added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with lb ft of Here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on They say you need only add per quart of oil every A oz bottle is I still have my If this product is really so great why it was so little known The salesman said it is widely used in I didn't believe The demo was so impressive that I bought a bottle against my common Has anyone heard of or actually used this product Is it real If you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the second See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or Jason Chen
