From Lawrence Keys Subject Re Necessity of fuel injector cleaning by dealership In article Jim Grey writes In article writes In your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning will do much more good than just using detergent While I agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged do they get and is a good price or can I do it myself by buying a can of what and doing what A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner and sending you on your merry way Go to KMart and buy the cleaner yourself for Personally i wouldn't use the product from I knew about this previously but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss their resident tech type discussed these products and recommends not using them the non isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your And although the others ethyl based do clean injectors they also cause rubber components in the fuel system to deteriorate and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel I use a product recommended by VW called by BG Products It cost more about but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects and its results are supposed to last from to I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene sp I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either since i only use these product as a preventative maintenance Just because you dealer sez you need it don't mean it's necessarily Be jim grey Larry OO FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates that you probably wouldn't understand anyway
