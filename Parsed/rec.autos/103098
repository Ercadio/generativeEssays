From James P Callison Subject Re SHO and SC In article A David Hwang writes In article unisql UUCP wrat unisql UUCP wharfie writes In article chrissC qB D B netcom com Chris Silvester writes WAGON, which I have heard is somehow slightly faster than the Coupe Wagon has an automatic, it's slower Could be due to the rear end ratio also Usually automatics have different rear ends than manuals, from my limited experience anyways You'll have fun looking for the rear end gears on an SHO the Taurus is a front wheel drive vehicle I went back and checked the article again The SHO Wagon is quicker than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick eg disabled persons , but they aren't in any position to use an SHO anyway I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all performance type cars like the l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like we'd cut down on the number of accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans, but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO James James P Callison Microcomputer Coordinator, U of Oklahoma Law Center C C DISCLAIMER I'm not an engineer, but I play one at work The forecast calls for Thunder ' T Bird SC It's a hell of a thing, killing a man You take away all he has and all he's ever gonna have Will Munny, Unforgiven
