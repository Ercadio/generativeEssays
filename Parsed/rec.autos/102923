From Ken Dye Subject Re Feedback requested on lowering ' Mustang In article Jeff Perry writes I have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early Installation envolves moving the upper A arm and installation of a wedge shaped spacer between the A arm and ball Apparently Shelby Mustangs did a similair modification but left out the I would be interested in feedback pro or con on such a I'm no mustang head but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension that is with no upper A arm Just a strut going down to a lower control arm single bushing not an A arm with a tension compression rod locating it in the forward backward direction Anyway simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs cutting the springs lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the In each of these cases the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore the suspension IMHO the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to Ken Ken Dye an optimist is a guy Lachman Technology Chicago that has never had much experience archy
