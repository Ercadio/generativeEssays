from subject re nissan nomenclature was re manual shift bigots wanted the european version is called sx and have a 1.8 liter engine with
turbo and have more power than the us version ( 169 hp ); it goes from
0 to 100 km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 km/h ( 140 miles/h ).
i just purchased one ( new ) and i am looking for a repair book. i could
not find one in france and germany; does anybody knows where to find one ?
is there one in the uk ?
probabaly no use to look in the us as the 240 sx have here a different motor.
i am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have
good technical documentation about the car i own. regards
