From Brian J Queiser Subject Re The Mustang Peterson writes jmh Jeffrey Hoffmeister writes The Bald Runner writes I just have got to remind all of you that this is it Yes that's right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars will be introducing an all new mega cool way too fast for Accord drivers It's supposed to be streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car Ford came out with around I can't Anyone out there hear anything about it recently If everything I've read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job of The new mustang is nothing but a re cycle of a year old is it already Yes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be differe nt on the new car as far as mechanical's is The suspension will most likely be changed as well as the drive From what has been printed on it there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will have the modular and others the current small just have to wait and see Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good a return to C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a ' or ' You know I'm a Ford fan I must say so I'm looking forward to the next I have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable than the Camaro is You know that's The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality just the It used to be quality and GM is barely catching up but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk door hood panel alignments it's those year old And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash tm But like I said they're getting better and making the move in the right They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro Firebird but really only in Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth Besides no bow tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang I do not put much stock in the mag rags' inside information or even Ford rep The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's Inside information had the Taurus with a and rear wheel drive at one I wouldn't look for a simple re paneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself if you There's a lot of Ford hasn't released a new car without a wheel IS in The Mustang project has been brewing for at least right A wheel IS could Those modular 's are out there In the interest of CAFE and competition don't rule those out Your ignorant if you And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there who really knows what it'll look like The Mach III Doubt The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile It attracts way more attention than the Camaro Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit I submit that the Mustang will be a Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans You know intelligent critical spews like The Mustang bites man Some of you are already I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers as I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel as The Camaro is still a huge automobile the Mustang will retain its cab rearward styling and short pony car The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot while the Mustang will appeal to the The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college degreed muscle car Both will be more refined I do think the Camaro is There will be no clear Unless the Ford gets the You don't seriously believe that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you Regards Brian I am the engineer I can choose Department of Engineering Mechanics Ohio State University Columbus OH
