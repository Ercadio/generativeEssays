From Balaji V Ramanathan Subject Re Plymouth Sundance Dodge Shadow experiences In article qofeaINN I We are Gaia writes just stopped putting money into it I must have put at least worth of repairs over it's lifetime I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things area The part about spending on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about or so more in initial costs Essentially, it means that you spend about extra on repairs on the Taurus That is ridiculous Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things I would much rather spend more in initial costs than spend more in repair costs Cut here for Signature Balaji Ramanathan, Institute of Transportation Studies, I don't believe in luck University of California, Irvine I RELY on it
