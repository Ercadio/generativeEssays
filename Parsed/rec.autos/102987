From Adam Edwards Subject Re chevy sprint In wfnMBJG WBOE L Srinagesh Gavirneni sg andrew cmu edu writes I have a chevy sprint with a c and doors It's odometer turned k and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He said, It is to be changed every k, but since I bought the car when it had k, I don't know if the same thing happened at k and k He quoted for the part and to install it The part cost outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help Also, what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction Any help would be greatly apprecisted Thanks I sold my ' Sprint last April with k on it I'd driven it since the previous July, putting k miles on it The sensor light used to light up regularly, starting about k miles after I bought it My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment, so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement Performance hah, if you could call it that did not change Perhaps emissions increased, but how much emissions could a CA registered cylinder engine produce That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand Has anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant Just curious Adam Edwards
