From Karl Elvis MacRae Subject Ford Explorer question and SUV Ok so in my ongoing search for a sport utility here's the latest Toyota Small Small The interior of this vehical is impossible for a large Too bad it would have been the winner Nissan Pathfinder Very low My head hit the roof Fun on bumps no Also has a cheap looking Isuzu Trooper Class This is a really really nice Very comfortable handled Has really cool grab handles But it's huge and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk also the manual shift is weird and kind of I'd buy this if it were cheaper or But at this size and for this price I kept picturing trying to park in in San No Chevy Blazer Cheap Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan but still too Ford Explorer This is no sports car and it's certainly not for the serious off But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving though it would be nice if it had a bit The automatic tranny is pretty nice head and shoulders above my ' mazda The steering is not as tight as I'd like but it's The two door has easy to enter back seats Easier to get into in fact than the driver's seat of the and with a shorter wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny Yes I'm a manual shift biggot I admit it's the one I'm thinking of So that said is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it Anyone had any major problems Heard any horror stories Also any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo both being essentially the same vehical Thanks Karl Karl Elvis MacRae Software Release Support Cisco Systems or DoD Shovels and rakes and implements of destruction Arlo Guthrie
