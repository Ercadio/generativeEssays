From FRED BACH Subject Re Dirty Diesels In article Erik Velapoldi writes I heard the diesels are considered cleaner burning than gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide Hydrocarbons and Oxides of CO HC NOX But they can put out a lot of particulate I heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions Is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels How about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars Would it be any different than a catylitic converter I'd assume easier since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting Let's hear people's VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate Also VW uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps reduce particulates as well although I don't know the mechanics of Many diesel cars busses and trucks in Europe are now being equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up diesel emissions already well below legal limits It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even further ahead of gas engines in erik I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel motors in cars trucks and busses but I think they are probably measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or diesel truck and some diesel They stink And it's always roll up the windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front of me when I am driving with my I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good control in diesel engines and that's why they So the invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in Yeah well so what Someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and as far as I am concerned those kind are just as I am all for de stinking the diesel It'll keep the traffic signs cleaner Fred Bach Operations Group Internet TRIUMF TRI University Meson Facility Voice loc WESBROOK MALL UBC CAMPUS FAX University of British Columbia Vancouver CANADA These are my opinions which should ONLY make you read think and They do NOT necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow
