From dbernard Dave Bernard Subject Re Ad said Nissan Altima best seller I too was puzzled by this obvious What I think is going on is that Nissan claims that the Altima is the best selling new car namelplate in the US I think I have this near verbatim Lee Iaccoca's statistics would have been proud of that Note that the Corolla Prism are also new but hey are not new I guess Nissan doesn't even sell as many Altimas as Toyota does Corollas or there would be no nameplate
