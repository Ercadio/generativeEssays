From Craig Boyle Subject Re LH Workmanship In article writes I just visited the NY Auto Show and saw two LH cars on the floor Eagle Vision and Dodge Really nice I must Very attractive styling lots of features and room at a competitive Unfortunately the workmanship is quite On BOTH cars the rubber seals around the window and door fell It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door Surely it would come off Lack of build quality was the thing I notced on the first LH's I saw months The panel gaps were large and non uniform between the cars I saw the kind of thing you expect and accept on a Mustang but not from Chrysler's I drove one of the low end cars and thought it was more than I'd prefer an LH to a Taurus from my brief Craig I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering assembly problems that will show up I may still consider buying it but only when it establishes a good track Jason Chen
