From Bob Blackshaw Subject Re BRAINDEAD Drivers Who Don't Look Ahead In Bob Pitas writes In article Donna Martz writes Stuff Deleted Excuse me but I understood what Smith AND I have often observed when traffic is blocked solid that if a few people yeild to the moron who is impatiently riding bumpers the slug at the front of the pack will miraculously wake up change lanes and viola no more Granted the situation here does not apply to rush hour in a crowded But I have observed this situation regularly on your average interstate six or eight sets of cars side by side bunched up in a pack with open freeway fore and aft as far as you can The people who refuse to yeild as a point of honor are just as annoying as the slug in the I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don't want to give them that one car length when they should just wait like you BUT if you're one of those people that just sit's behind the person and doesn't flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to go by and you're not just drafting them then get the hell out of the way of someone who will I especially hate it when you flash someone at the back of a line and they don't 'pass it on' So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't 'pass it on' and few if any do what next On major highways or more lanes in each direction keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are Also as someone posted in this thread here in the area we have a few left lane exits sounds like If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you won't cause these yoyos won't make We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry up yahoos dive into cause they want to get When we get to the point where these ramps merge all hell breaks The result is that traffic which was moving at on the VA side of the bridge stalls on t'other If these dingbats had stayed in lane allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge we would still be doing Instead we do start stop for Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be real useful Bob PS If you drive the beltway and want to merge look for a brown Probe with a silver haired driver then use your signals I don't read minds but I do try to be They told me courtesy was contagious but I guess the folks around here have had their shots
