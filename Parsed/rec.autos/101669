From Robert J Wade Subject Re Integra GSR Quad reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable, then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance shafts The Acura has the engine wins the reliablity contest hands down You can rev that car all day, everyday, and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else I speak from expierence I'm not saying the Quad is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a a couple of things blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and while it is true that quad 's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for year k miles other than that i have found my quad to be completely solid and the direct ignition system means no wires rotor rotor cap to ever deal with also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments ever i'm not badmouthing the integra engine, i just think you are going overboard on slamming the quad you are quite correct that the integra engine is quieter, although i would not say smoother, my quad loves to rev, especially at the high end do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on quad s i have not heard of this
