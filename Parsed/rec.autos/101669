From Robert Wade Subject Re Integra GSR Quad reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance Acura has the engine wins the reliablity contest hands You can rev that car all day everyday and you'll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything I speak from expierence I'm not saying the Quad is a bad engine but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a a couple of things blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability and while it is true that 's have a problem with head gasket leaks that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for other than that i have found my to be completely solid and the direct ignition system means no wires rotor rotor cap to ever deal also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments i'm not badmouthing the integra engine i just think you are going overboard on slamming the you are quite correct that the integra engine is quieter although i would not say smoother my loves to rev especially at the high do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on i have not heard of
