From Chris BeHanna Subject Re Auto air conditioning without Freon In article A ALOIS M HIMSL writes Yes, I have the same questions What makes me upset is that R costs are skyrocketing and in fact can't be bought anymore in my area Also this is yet another way mechanics and dealers can RIP OFF customers Also I was reading that the new refrigerant is not compatible with the r system and that it would cost upto a to retrofit a car with the old R system ALthough it is important to consider the environment I think the sudden ban is a slap in the face for the consumer Why is it that the consumer should have to pay for the retrofit The auto companies should have seen this coming Also why is it that the governments of the world were so quick in banning freon use and yet so slow in banning gasoline In my opinion gasoline is just as hazardous as anything else Why can't they start proposing bans on this and switch to natural gas or electric The technology is there Hopefully some chemist will come up with another alternative coolant that will be compatible with the old system Al H Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society MACS , that is, the people who stand to rake in that to per retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those R substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very shaky technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst Does this piss you off Yes Write a letter to your congressman, to your senator, to the president, to the EPA, and to the DOT and complain Later, Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady CB T Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX needs a name agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs
