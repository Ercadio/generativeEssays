From Les Bartel Subject Fast idle on Ford Ranger It did it This morning my Ford Ranger was idling at Ok so I exaggerated a little but it was idling very It has a liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal I don't think the linkage is stuck What can I do to fix this problem This has been a problem from time to time but has straightened itself out until I don't have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast as it should This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up at a stop Many thanks for any les Les Bartel I'm going to live forever Intergraph Corporation or die trying Electronics Division or
