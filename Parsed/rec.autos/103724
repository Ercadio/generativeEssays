from jay cadiz subject gts headlight covers i have a eagle talon and i wanted a pair of gts headlight covers actually, they are turning signal
covers since the talons that year had pop-up lights.
i went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning
signal covers in stock. i asked how much it would be
and he told me it would cost me another $40. i thought
this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic.
can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one? jay cadiz motorola, inc.
