From ZINGALE THOMAS J Subject Re chevy sprint In article Srinagesh Gavirneni I have a chevy sprint with a c and It's odometer turned and the sensor light started I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen He said It is to be changed every but since I bought the car when it had I don't know if the same thing happened at and He quoted for the part and to install The part cost outside but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors Also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's Also what are the results of the oxygen sensor Any help would be greatly apprecisted Thanks Nagesh I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every to let you know it's time for a check When that light goes on I just take it to the delaer tell them It's that time and they work on it for hou and you pay for parts and for they get for labor I currently have about on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen What the heck is an Oxygen sensor As far an I know of I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a Now I don't have a c Mother Nature does that for me and that might have something to do with it but I still never heard of an Oxygen The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the Rotor Distributor and Gasket And that was all done within the past What I do at is have a good tune up let them replace what ever they need to pay the bill about and go home and don't worry about the car for another Oh I just remembered If that little sensor light bothers you in the fuse box right below the turn signal lever up against the dash there is a swith on the right Flip that switch and the light will go I do that so that little light won't annoy If you can't find it look it up in the car I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the Oxygen sensor Thomas E Mail Address Give me an an army of West Point graduates and I'll win a Give me a handful of Texas Aggies Creator of MOT POWER and I'll win a George Patton
