From ZINGALE, THOMAS J Subject Re chevy sprint In article wfnMBJG WBOE L , Srinagesh Gavirneni sg andrew cmu edu writes I have a chevy sprint with a c and doors It's odometer turned k and the sensor light started blinking I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor He said, It is to be changed every k, but since I bought the car when it had k, I don't know if the same thing happened at k and k He quoted for the part and to install it The part cost outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed Also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help Also, what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction Any help would be greatly apprecisted Thanks Nagesh I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every K to let you know it's time for a check up When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them It's that time and they work on it for hou and you pay for parts and for labor Ahh what they get for labor I currently have about K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor What the heck is an Oxygen sensor As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten Now, I don't have a c Mother Nature does that for me and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced And that was all done within the past months What I do at K is have a good tune up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill about and go home and don't worry about the car for another K Oh, I just remembered something If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side Flip that switch and the light will go off I do that so that little light won't annoy me If you can't find it, look it up in the car manuel I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the Oxygen sensor Thomas E Mail Address Give me an an army of West Point, TJZ ZEUS TAMU EDU graduates and I'll win a battle Give me a handful of Texas Aggies, Creator of MOT POWER and I'll win a war Gen George S Patton
