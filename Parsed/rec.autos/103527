From Albion H Bowers Subject Re V V V V Vx s In a previous article, Lawrence C Smith says In article C v MD K , matthew liggett writes V must be one somewhere Believe Bugatti's coming has out one Something like turbos and mucho macho HP One cool price too, as i heard At any rate, the point is, i'm pretty sure there is, indeed, one in production tho rather limited This is NO Bugatti It's labeled a Bugatti but has nothing to do with the Bugatti's of yore, from what I understand Just some ppl wanting to build a silly supercar and use that name to sell it Drew may be thinking of the Cizeta Morodor v t, but that hasn't reached production, at least not yet As for the Bugatti, well, I have to agree with Matt, it ain't the top dog, it ain't sexy and svelt looking, and it ain't a real Bugatti In fact, it looks like it's in tight competition with the Consulier for the most butt ugly car of the decade award It isn't that bad At least the Bugatti EB has compound curves compared to the slab sides on the Consulier And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V thing of it as three cylinder turbo engines tied together Also Ettore Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the development So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in today's world Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to take over part of Ferrari as well I don't know of any cars with v , but there are a number of motorcycles with them but I couldn't tell you which ones, all motorcycles look alike to me D That's funny I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about cages' Most GP cc motorcycles are V s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V s from the VF F through the VF F, including the RC race bike and the present VFR F It should be noted that Lancia built a V in recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe Al Bowers DOD Alfa Ducati Hobie Kottke 'blad Iaido NASA Well goodness sakes don't you know that girls can't play guitar Mary Chapin Carpenter
