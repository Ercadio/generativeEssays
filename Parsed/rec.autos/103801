From Mark Monninger Subject Re Car buying story, was Christ, another dealer service scam In article A Dan Day writes In article A writes before you go in Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable profit for the dealer , offer them that price and stick to it Whoa Watch your terminology Dealer invoice is not dealer cost That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory kick backs, incentives, etc are paid and that often depends on his volume at the end of the month quarter whatever It might be a funny munber but it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays sticker price is really being ripped off Mark
