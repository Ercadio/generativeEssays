From Joe Staudt Subject Re Renting from Alamo In article writes Hello netters I'm visiting the US I'm from Sweden in I will probably rent a Chevy Beretta from I've been quoted for a week for additional This would include free driving distance but not local taxes Baltimore They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but I doubt that 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what's included in the base But on the other hand he didn't rent it from Does anyone have some info on this Is a rip off No that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that Probability that I'll be needing more insurance Unless you have an accident you won't need If you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental Also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you don't want The credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to I have never rented from Alamo so I don't know if they follow this same Is the beretta a good rental car It is a compact door probably a bit dull performance and acceleration wise but very It will have an automatic transmission AM FM stereo air conditioning and possibly power windows and door Joe Joseph Staudt Telxon Box Usenet is like Tetris for people who still Akron OH remember how to Heller
