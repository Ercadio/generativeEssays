From Roy Matthew Thigpen Subject Re Plymouth Sundance Dodge Shadow experiences I don't know if some lemons are out there but from personal experience My brother's has been trouble Not one single repair only regular The only work he had done on it was a result of his he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn on a busy intersection and was rear He has a Plymouth I would recomend it but I would also like to say that if you can wait about six months ChryCo is coming out with a new car called the Neon that is built in the same way as the LH's Good luck with your
