From Tom Pickett Subject Re SHO and SC In article qehi , Jim Frost writes Ok, I'll give you a few reasons Neither car was designed to turn at those speeds Neither car was designed to stop quickly from those speeds Safety mechanisms were not designed for impacts at those speeds An uncontrolled environment leads to unpredictable circumstances where you might need to turn or stop with no notice Do you, by any chance own an SHO or have access to one, such that you would have any idea what it is designed for or how it handles Just wondering Tom Pickett or SHO GOZE
