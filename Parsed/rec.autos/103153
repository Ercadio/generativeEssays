From Wes Fujii Subject Re Improvements in Automatic Transmissions Shazad Barlas wrote To wheelspin in an auto you keep the gear in N gas it then stick the gear in I've never tried this but am sure it works but does this screw up the autobox We're having a bit of a debate about it I've known more people to leave their rear ends in pieces doing this especially if they have reasonable power to transmit and good traction on the road You're better off Wes Fujii A real motor is an Oldsmobile Rocket HURST This is NOT the new generation of Olds Wes BANZAI Fujii OLDS Boise Idaho
