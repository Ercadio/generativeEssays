From Michael Chmilar Subject Re MBenz series, VW Passat Jeremy Corry writes new series Mercedes Benz wagon Particularly, I would like to hear about power manual t only Any comparisons between the Saab line and the Mercedes would be helpful If a manual transmission is a must have , then the M B TE is not in the running You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America It seems that buyers here or, maybe more accurately, the distributors are not interested in manual trannies The ' line comes with a hp engine All earlier years are hp I have an ' E, with a mere hp and auto tranny, and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation More is always nice, but I can't complain I test drove a Saab CSE last fall Here are my impressions Awesome power, especially over rpm, when the turbo really comes on If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front wheel drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously hook into the corner Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful front drive cars The CSE is hp Mercedes is rear drive, so it does not have this problem Huge interior and cargo space The most rubbery shifter I have ever encountered I drove a spd It was absolutely numb You might be able to get used to it I don't know I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed the car for an automatic It was rather noisy Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks Mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics You should also check out the new BMW touring This is a wagon version of the i It fits into the class with the TE and Saabs Michael Chmilar
