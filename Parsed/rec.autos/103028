From Max Lu Subject Re Auto air conditioning without Freon It is actually simple in principle Porous adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate water or methanol, etc giving the cooling effect Upon being heated, the gas saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be condensed This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle The only problem is that the COP is very low Max Max G Q Lu, PhD Internet Division of Thermal Enginerring Bitnet School of MPE, Nanyang Technological University Phone Nanyang Avenue, Singapore Fax
