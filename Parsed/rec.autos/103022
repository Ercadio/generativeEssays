From Robert Wade Subject Re RE Aftermarket A C units Les Bartel's comments Sorry I can't help you with your question but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A C I have a Frost King or Frost Temp forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with The fan is noisy and doesn't put out much I will never have an aftermarket A C installed in any of my vehicles I just can't trust the quality and performance after this les Let me add my I had a A C installed by the Ford garage and it did not work as well as the A C that was installed by the factory in pickups identical to I have talked to other people that have had the same Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what Ernie Smith i agree never have the dealer add anything to your if you want a c make sure it is factory installed honda's maybe excluded many can't be bought with a c installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in bigger radiator are designed properly for this in the place anyway my point is the dealer installed a c won't be anywhere near as good as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing scratches screwdriver holes in not reinstalled correctly or with all the screws i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for said never have a dealer add anything to your except maybe
