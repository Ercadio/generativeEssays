From jfox John Fox SunExpress IR Subject Re Jeep Grand Toyota Runner In article IG Jonathan Edwards writes I am considering buying one of these two vehicles new I want a fun to drive family vehicle that can go through The Jeep is very popular and has the All Wheel Drive wheel anti lock roomy passenger cabin but limited cargo with an internal spare THe Toyota is an aging design with only part time wheel and only rear anti lock and no anti lock in It also has a very inconvenient rear gate not to mention awkward ingress to the passenger Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned They aren't really at the same point along the SUV spectrum not to mention price How about the Explorer Trooper Blazer Montero and if the budget allows the Land Cruiser Bear in mind that of all SUV's purchased never venture off Carefully weigh the trade off between comfort and off road performance when choosing one and realistically decide whether you'll actually make enough use of the off road ability to sacrifice some of the on road John John
