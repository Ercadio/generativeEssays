From Mihir Pramod Shah Subject Re saturn puzzled by its pricing In article A yung kao hsu writes I am the person who started out this subject To me, the question really is not about dealer profit but the amount of money for the type of car I've settled with a new Subaru Wagon with the similar amount of money a Saturn dealer asked for a SW OK, I know it's a model, but I think I got a better car though I have to adjust my initial idea of why I am getting a new car Today, during a conversion with a friend, I learned he rejected a Saturn for a Ford Tarurs as it only costed him a little bit more than a SL I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL I agree that a fully loaded SL would come close in price to a LOWER END Ford Taurus A FULLY LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL A fully loaded SL would run somewhere around , , while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the , , range A base Taurus GL I believe might start around , Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push , if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate I can't see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled by its pricings Oh, we did not spend much time getting our deals being better informed has its advantages Well, that's ok At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are You seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones Then again, I may be wrong Yung Kao Hsu Mihir Shah
