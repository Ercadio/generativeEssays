From ae Freenet carleton ca Steve Hui Subject Re New ' Talon I would also be interested in finding out about the ' Talon, and I suspect that many other people would be interested too, so let's get some responses on the net The question again Does anyone have any info on the Eagle Talon Mitsubishi Eclipse Plymouth Laser I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant, and that in Japan, a hp twin turbo V Galant has been released So anyway, any info on the ' Talon would be appreciated Steve Hui
