From Craig Boyle Subject Re Too fast In article Jim Frost writes Craig Boyle writes The quality of autobahns is something of a The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX They are better in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings They light the highways in Texas Funny everywhere else I've been they only light 'em at Sorry by they I meant autobahns not US I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially than most of the roads A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at will kill you at Don't get me wrong I love to It would have to be quite I don't recall any US freeway without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe at in any decent well damped I suspect you have very limited experience US freeways vary dramatically particularly between I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where would be very optimistic in any Well I've driven in every state but Alaska and drive about per I take long cross country trips any chance I get its fun for me and I can get My job allows me to drive rather than Not to labor the point but I've driven just about every freewayin the US Germany UK and France plus some in Mexico which was surpisingly I'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but I suspect every single bridge junction on through CT would be considered They're hard to take at That's not the only interstate I've seen with such deviations but it's one I drive Yes but as a age of the total freeway in the US All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard advising people to slow to or Texas is pretty much an edge case you can't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such Texas freeways are varied sometimes a good Mostly But in CA is comparable and wide open It just ain't Given the absence of other traffic and car built for most US freeways are just The problem is other road users and jim frost Craig
