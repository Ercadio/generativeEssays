From richard welty Subject Frequently Asked Consumer Automotive Questions Archive name rec autos this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to rpw changes as of April revised brake fluid section as non silicone DOT fluids are now apparently available rpw Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions Q What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean A Typically you will see something like the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually The is the aspect ratio' it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall Our example tire has a sidewall height of The is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in The R means Radial and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely Common speed ratings are S T H and V up to Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like the indicates the per tire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous What follows is a table showing a number of load indices' and corresponding maximum per tire loads Load Index Max Load Kg Note that the usual mass weight confusion occurs in this In some cases the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size the LT designation indicates Light Truck and the P designation indicates Passenger If no letter is given then the application of the tire is Passenger car As far as I know these letters only appear in the US The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility For the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at If the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be Tires with an MS mud snow designation may have their speed rating reduced by km h about There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and Temperature and Traction are graded A B and C with A the best and C the worst treadwear is a numeric These values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of Q My car has tires with a funny size designation can i put normal tires on the car A Your tires are called TRX tires they were devised by Because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high TRX type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to Michelin Avon makes suitable Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX Q Can I rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car A Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes Michelin and Goodyear others for example Pirelli and Nokia will void warranties if such swapping is The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer's Q How many snow tires should I buy and if I buy which end of the car should I put them on A In short and both To explain many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous With a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front In a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill Radar Detectors and Speed Limits Q Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q A posting A Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between and always start long tedious and pointless flame If you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to or and keep it Safety Equipment Q Do airbags really work A Preliminary statistics suggest the following Airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone and AirBags point belts work slightly better than point belts The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver's hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more Brake Questions Q Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned Midas always wants to do A There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn Note also that some rotors the rotors on many Hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly Q They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car Is this really a good idea A It used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum In modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill Otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch On the other hand many standard driver's license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking I suggest that before taking a US driver's test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the Q How often should I replace my brake fluid A Probably more often than you Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the DOT type are older fluids DOT and DOT are newer The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake DOT fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements DOT fluids have better boiling point requirements and DOT fluids have the best boiling point requirements but DOT fluids are not clearly superior see the next Q A for more While the requirements imply that DOT fluids are better than DOT fluids there may be specific cases where a DOT fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition Otherwise DOT type fluids offer much improved brake pedal Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly Q What about DOT brake fluids A This breaks down in to two The DOT specification looks excellent for performance but the first DOT fluids were Silicone Silicone fluids are a tricky Unlike DOT and DOT fluids they do not absorb water at While this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion Because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT standard that do not contain Silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT and DOT fluids but I have little information at this Q ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at but it costs Is it worth it A This does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and The short answer is that ABS costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver' that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any Now for the long ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the It cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of The sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE equivalent When the sensors detect lockup the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle' typically in an ABS system this is about On dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every Unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only Audi of the manufacturers producing ABS equipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering This is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are Braking distances will lengthen An important caution ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice don't expect an ABS system to help you out very The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your As far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions I've listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for but the OE master cylinder for the ABS equipped version of the same car lists for over Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT silicone brake fluids in ABS equipped Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular I suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very Q What about this threshold braking business A normally I'd not put this in the consumers Q A but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely and is much to be Basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold' feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake In many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress In any case if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit you're not very near the In a car with ABS often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take Recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with ABS The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems but according to Autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking' an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic If you think about it for a minute you'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an ABS system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be Gas Questions Q Does High Octane gasoline help A Maybe maybe Some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being On most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run Check your owner's manual for details on what your car Q My car was made for leaded Will unleaded gas hurt it A It is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the Amoco Oil company argues The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little You should however check your owner's manual many cars from the early do not actually require leaded Q Do fuel treatments help What kind should I use A Some do and some don' During the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection Never use an additive containing Methanol sometimes called Methyl Alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner's manual on your car before using Most manufacturers consider Ethanol acceptable in Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol Isopropanol and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas There are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the run of the mill ones but work much much Among these are Chevron Techron Redline SL Wurth Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber' and BG A bottle of one of these once every six months is highly Q What about detergent gasolines A The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat BMW has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas If such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve Lubrication Questions Q What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean A There are several different items There is a two letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like SE SF CD or The S codes are for gasoline engine applications the C codes are for diesel engine The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus SF is considered better than SE SE is considered better than SD and so The more noticeable designation is the oil This is either a single number weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W The latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators The first number in the designation is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the W stands for winter' The second number is the viscosity of the oil when There is a trick here the oil doesn't actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight as it gets hotter it doesn't get thin as fast as a oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when Note also that the novel behaviour of multi grade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX oils do not retain their multi grade characteristics well over and oils work very well Q Are quick lube' places any good A Some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out Let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all Q Are oil additives like Slick or Tufoil any good A Slick and Tufoil are PTFE based Many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the moly based additives that have been around since the early ' PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon TM a trademark owned by In general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of MPG after application smoother revving but long term results whether PTFE additives are effective after miles are Some manufacturers such as Saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick to their This writer has been cautioned by a Slick Dealer that Slick should not be used in Japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the Otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE On the other hand there are satified Slick customers in the Q Do synthetic oils really work A Yes More specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your Even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely Amsoil Redline and AGIP are very highly regarded and very Mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews Q Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change How often should I change my oil A It depends on how you If your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer's recommendation is probably If however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile If you don't drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months If you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of Questions Q My car has a timing I hear that bad things happen when they What's the story A It depends on the internal design of the Early Ford Escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new Some Honda motors will not be damaged but others will If no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every miles some cars may require more frequent Ask your dealer or independent Also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly Q Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks A For performance Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented Q What causes Unintended Acceleration A The final report of the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator is probably the richard welty Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' Carroll Smith
