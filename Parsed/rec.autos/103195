From Chris Silvester Subject Production Hold on ' Firebird Camaro w Speed After a tip from Gary Crum I got on the Phone with Pontiac Systems or Pontaic Customer Service or whatever and inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and Trans BTW Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me After being routed to a Firebird Specialist I was able to confirm that this is in fact the At first there was some problem with the performance axle She wouldn't go into any details so I don't know if there were some shipped that had problems or if production was held up because they simply didn't have the proper parts from the As I say she was pretty vague on that so if anyone else knows anything about this feel free to Supposedly this problem is now Second there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six speed Manual So as of this posting there is a production hold on these She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car and therefore having to wait for the right high quality I'm not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well but I'm guessing it Can anyone else shed some light on this Chris Chris Silvester Any man capable of getting himself elected President should by no means be allowed to do the job Douglas Adams The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
