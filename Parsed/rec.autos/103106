From Andrew Spencer Subject Re It's a was Re Too fast In a previous article Gary Mahan says Why should a good driver be terrified at The only thing I fear going at are drivers who switch to the left lane without using either rear view mirror or Doing to ain't a rush for me but it's fun and I get where I want to go much In defense of the drivers who are in the right Here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of I don't think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the Do you in the states when you look in the rear view ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on a speed Dont get me wrong I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right I slow down a tad If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential I would be the stupid just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one It seems to me everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going You do not need to calculate the future You need to look at your mirrors a little If you glance around you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is Maybe not precisely but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to I know what you are talking about about the other driver being startled because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around when i'm doin The problem though as i saw it was not their fault for barreling around me but my fault for not paying the attention to my task at hand that i should have Oddly enough since the time happened in around when i'd had my liscence for around mo i haven't been i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG if i drive along with them it doesn't happen at all even on the long trips adrenaline will do that to 've had bad cop experiences with speeding so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for i'll get caught Maybe they should raise the limit so we can pay better just curious and my DREW
