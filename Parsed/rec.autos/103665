From Subject Re Viper Car Alarms In article Ronald E Garnett writes Hello auto enthusiasts I recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to get an alarm It's a Viper and has a shock sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door I have this same alarm installed in my It works The shock sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor I have on my other It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind but any kind of shock sets it Even kicking the tire sets it It works What worries me is the hood and If someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypass the The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on You can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the Although I know that you cannot pop the hood on the Syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet I have had zero none false alarms with this The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your I have been able to trace every alarm to it's cause and it was not a false I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the I guess it would be possible depending on the My Syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do There are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm but I don't have I really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm won't keep them from it even with a supplemental power Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detects people approcahing the This is primarily for I have a convertible and have looked at this feature in Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar It talks to people as they walk I saw one installed on a Lotus The kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get The owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems and about the viper in I am real happy with my One other feature I really like is you can tune it to your You can have it arm passively or You can disable the chirp for arming You can have it lock unlock the doors when the alarm is armed I like these I hate the chirp when the alarm arms disarms so mine flashes the lights I like the door lock feature although I have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the But if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the The car is an Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape Ron Garnett I looked seriously at the Alpine system It is a real nice system but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock The shock sensor is the Viper shock sensor is better cycle than the optional Alpine one I think the Viper gives you a lot of good value for the But it isn't absolutely No system Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Anyone know where we can get one of those installed Maybe that was what they had in the van in the World Trade Center huh Merrill
