From Tommy Reingold Subject Re Improvements in Automatic Transmissions Jeff Hagen writes The biggest hurdle for automatics IMHO is not shifting speed per se but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you try to force it to shift I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva is that a yuppie name or what and a Nissan They both had I'm a manual transmission bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than I And yes they responded very quickly to kickdown The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure out which gear I was The Olds may have also but I don't I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about mph when my foot told it No I really want to accelerate I would still prefer a manual but I won't delude myself into thinking that I can out accelerate a modern And I'm very smooth at shifting but certainly not as good as an Tommy Reingold AT T Bell Labs Holmdel NJ or att boole tommy
