From Subject Infiniti I am thinking about getting an Infiniti In consumer reports it is ranked high in many catagories including highest in reliability index for compact Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord A couple of things though In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this I see lots of Honda's and Toyota' There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity fully loaded at dealer cost I have check this out and the numbers match up They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid version includes dual air bags and want to get rid of their old ' I guess my question is Is this a good deal Also Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti Thanks Carl Hoffman The other cars that I have test driven and which are in the running are Mitsubishi Galant Honda Accord and Toyota Camary
