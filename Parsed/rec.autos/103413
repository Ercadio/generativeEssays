From Daniel Lovall Subject Buick heater controls I have a ' Buick Skylark with on I bought it in California and if it'll let me I'd like to keep it for another The only problem is these Indiana winters my heater controls don't The car has vacuum operated control switches for the Right now it is stuck in the vent It will blow warm air but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor I can live without this or the defrost I can't live without this I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position but this blows a lot of air in my face and is well kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem or part of it is with the two diaphragms which control up down and outside inside air THe diaphragm which controls outside vent in side no vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the Two questions Is there anything I should be aware of about this other than the fact that I should move from Indiana In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available is there a way to fix this THanks for any advice info selah Dan
