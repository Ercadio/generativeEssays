From Aamir Hafeez Qazi Subject Re Mercury Villager Minivan good buy From article r uckINN , by Wen King Su In article r cr INN Steven A Morris writes The Villager Quest seem like the best of the Cravan Voyager copies to come along since the Mazda MPV The NISSAN MAXIMA engine paired with the MAXIMA speed Auto Trans should be an excellent drive train, and the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered Only the price is controversial Hmm The last time I checked, Villager Quest does not have a Maxima engine, and is very much under powered for its weight Yes, it does come with the Maxima GXE engine mated to the Maxima SE transmission And it has decent power for a minivan also Check again Aamir Qazi Aamir Qazi Why should I care I'd rather watch drying paint
