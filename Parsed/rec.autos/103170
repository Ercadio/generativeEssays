From Andrew Spencer Subject Re It's a was Re Too fast In a previous article Gary Mahan says Dont get me wrong I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right I slow down a tad If I were to rely on the j udgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential I would be the stupid just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one It seems to me everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going You do not need I couldnt agree That is how it SHOULD People should also ALWAYS see motorcycles I CONSTANTLY scan behind me I have one of those wink mirrors and two outside I actually spend just as much time checking my six cops you know I still get caught off guard every now and Maybe I didnt word it right the first What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you you are stupid of course it depends on the circumstances I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy now if he was going in a thats a whole different story I can agree to this because as we have both proved what is ideally SUPPOSED to happen isn't And even though i'm rearely the one doing the passing i don't see where it makes you stupid but i agree that if you think you are SAFE because the other guy is SUPPOSED to have been paying attention then yes you are just as dumb as the other maybe dumber hasta DREW
