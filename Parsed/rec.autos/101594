From Craig Boyle Subject Re Integra GSR In article DEMOSTHENIS ZEPPOS writes In article J on Cochran writes I'd like to add the Beretta GTZ as a car which will kick GS R butt anyday and it's a lot cheaper to boot Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges somewhat like a Mustang and a CRX both have very different ways of doing things and ought to appeal to different buyers I don't think an Acura owner would be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice stuff deleted are all weather not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than No Integra I have seen comes with all season The GTZ does come with much bigger along with the Integra and the car does that with small inch tires that Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine Road Track and Car Driver have the GS R at to for Road and The C D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype supplied by The MT figures are more Also Quarter mile times vary from to sounds reasonable probably faster than regular So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep up with it in And the Beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage hp torque for the Integra for the Beretta You always believe those exact numbers why don't you drive a GS R and see for your self while the GS R has a low torqye its high gearing over a The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day It needs a speed box more than any other modern Essentially in a regualr Integra equals in the GSR and the regular Integras are very buzzy at rpm make up for the difference still wouldn't call it a torque moster though Considering you save almost dollars for the Beretta and the is a reliable engine it doesn't make sense to get the Integra as a The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a It was a piecve of junk but very quick for Quad reliable yeah what's your definition of reliable if that's reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than miles a rare screw up by Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed The performance enthusiasts would take the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the Craig
