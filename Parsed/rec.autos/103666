From Scott Leapman Subject Re AUTOFOM FOMBLIN A I tried the AutoFom stuff on my Saturn SC, and was so disappointed with it that I returned it for a refund I polished the car for hours and couldn't remove the swirl marks thin film that was all over the finish It also attracted more dirt than without the stuff
