from scott leapman subject re autofom fomblin a i tried the autofom stuff on my saturn sc, and was so disappointed with it
that i returned it for a refund. i polished the car for 2 hours and couldn't
remove the swirl marks/thin film that was all over the finish. it also
attracted more dirt than without the stuff.
