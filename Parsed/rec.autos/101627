From Ian Boyle Subject Re What is Volvo And all of these cars are driven fairly hard None of them are at the head of a line of cars going MPH the first two spend a lot of their operating life with the speedometer pegged and the only reason the doesn't is it has a MPH speedo What I want to know is have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized by someone in a Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what Turbo in UK was good for mph Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I believe the Beetle corners better I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes' This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car Not sure how long the small shit box Volvos last too damn long The worst car I ever drove was a hired In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something from the s, without the character The only ceased production a couple of years back I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough I ought to go for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts
