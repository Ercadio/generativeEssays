From Bob Blackshaw Subject Re Dumbest automotive concepts of all time In A Dan Day writes In article C HHGM rM constellation ecn uoknor edu James P Callison writes In article A Dan Day writes How about those really ugly fake wheel compartments stuck onto the trunk or side or both sides of some tacky luxury cars Some of 'em aren't fake if you're talking about the Continental kit, named after the Lincoln Continental, the first car to sport one I personally would love to have a ' T Bird with a Continental kit and the supercharged V that is one of the most beautiful cars ever built, IMHO I'd go for a ' Lincoln Continental if I could find one Sad part is that Edsel Ford designed it, and look at the abortion they named after him Ain't no justice Okay, I'll admit it looks nice on the T Bird as a previous owner of and Thunderbirds, I'm biased anyway
