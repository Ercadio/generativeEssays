From Donna Martz Subject Re BRAINDEAD Drivers Who Don't Look Ahead writes So I block the would be Not only for my own good but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize As a rule of philosophy I don't feel particularly sorry when somebody gets offed by his own stupidity but It does worry me when some idiot is in a position to cash in my chips Mayo Donna Martz writes Well Aren't we just Altruism himself Just what the world needs another frustrated self appointed traffic writes Well if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a foot semi I suppose it's your neck however I'm not going to let you kill me in the If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death due to less that wise driving practices then TOUGH Well I never wrote that I would act as you I stated that I would not block a would be I would not block a would be passer for their own good or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident fatal or In fact I could imagine how blocking a would be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being offed or involved in an accident especially if this passer is riding your Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a wise driving practice it only causes the jam to become more I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a pack of vehicles I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper I signal my intention to move to the right and do so at the first opportunity hope they will open the jam I feel this is not only courteous driving but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights or if all else fails will briefly speed up slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to I feel it is never safe to ride anyone's IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason I feel they deserve at the very least Sorry this is soooooooo
