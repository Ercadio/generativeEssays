From Paul Hovnanian Subject Re Re Toyota Land Cruiser worth it In response to a post about SUV's I got several unsolicited recommendations to check out the Land Cruiser despite its astronomical The Toyota dealer told me it's a cult car If a car is good enough to create a passionate and loyal following there must be something really extraordinary about So all you Land Crusher Cultists here is your chance to convert Jonathan Edwards IntraNet Inc Based on my experience with a ' the hard top jeep style model I would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the The older models are VERY well Unless Toyota lost its mind I would assume until proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their Two major differences in the running gear that I'm aware of need My ' has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model but only experience will The independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy the typical user who will never need a real utility The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer I'm not sure but I think Tioyota went to a full time or all wheel drive The older Landcruisers have a lock up Both have their advantages and Paul Hovnanian Std disclaimers apply
