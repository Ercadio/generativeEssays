From Subject VW Jetta GLI help I am considering the purchse of a VW Jetta GLI with miles on I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI and I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name the version has more horsepower wheel discs and a standard Oops that's the difference between the GLI and the regular GL So in addition to the engine what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI More importantly how can I tell which version this one is There are no badges that said so I am inclined to think that is the Assuming this one the one I looked at is the version is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less Of course I would love to get the version but money Please EMail any Thank Peter Volpe PV
