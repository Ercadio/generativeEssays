From Subject VW Jetta GLI help I am considering the purchse of a VW Jetta GLI with k miles on it I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI v and v I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name the v version has more horsepower, wheel discs, and a standard sunroof Oops, that's the difference between the GLI v and the regular GL So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is There are no badges that said v so I am inclined to think that is the v version Assuming this one the one I looked at is the v version, is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less Of course I would love to get the v version, but money talks Please EMail any responses Thank you Peter Volpe PV
