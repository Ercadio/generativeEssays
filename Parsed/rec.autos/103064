From James P Callison Subject Re Too fast In article qqv k e g usenet INS CWRU Edu aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer writes In a previous article, James P Callison says In article qn ev g usenet INS CWRU Edu aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer writes In a previous article, wrat unisql UUCP wharfie says That shows how much you know about anything The brakes on the SHO are very different inch or I forget discs all around, vented in front The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front, drums rear one i saw had vented rears too it was on a lot of course, the sales man was a fool titanium wheels yeah, right then later told me they were magnesium more believable, but still crap, since Al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good i tend to agree, tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard for running on a regular basis The brakes should be bigger, like or so take a look at the ones on the Corrados where they have braking regulations Well, let's see my T Bird SC has a computer controlled adjustable suspension, wheel ABS disks vented front, rear , point Rears also vented belts, sturdy passenger compartment, aerodynamics good enough for NASCAR without too much change, hp ft lb supercharged l V , wheel independent suspension plus limited slip differential , with a top speed in excess of mph, and rides on V rated tires I have yet to find R s in any other speed rating Is that up to standard If not, why not james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts Then you shouldn't've done it Try answering the damn question I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC in there never was a t'bird mentioned The discussion was about SHO's and 'stangs not being up to spec I do not know about t'birds I only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff This does not kn any way disencourage me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it a bad car It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra bit of safety and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large enough for them to fit if memory serves right, which it may very well not and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar characteristics front and rear disks ABS on the SHO , high output V , wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, point harness, fat rubber, and mph top speed If one of them is up to standard and I think the SC is , but the other isn't, then why is that No flamage, just curiousity James James P Callison Microcomputer Coordinator, U of Oklahoma Law Center C C DISCLAIMER I'm not an engineer, but I play one at work The forecast calls for Thunder ' T Bird SC It's a hell of a thing, killing a man You take away all he has and all he's ever gonna have Will Munny, Unforgiven
