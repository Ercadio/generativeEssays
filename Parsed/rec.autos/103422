From James Bruder Subject Honda clutch chatter anyone else experiencing a similar problem This concerns the clutch on a Honda Accord When the clutch is first used in the morning about the first miles of shifting there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm Then the clutch shifts This chatter started when I moved to the San Francisco Bay area from a low humidity The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non asbestos clutch No remedy Seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture Any comments out there
