From Dan Hepner Subject Re Dirty Diesels From Kumaravel Natarajan But they can put out a lot of particulate I heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions Is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels How about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars Would it be any different than a catylitic converter I'd assume easier since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting Let's hear people's The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer emissions laws involves three things I know of All compliant diesels are All use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger up to about PSI A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is No scrubbers catalytic converters etc are The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very Interestingly except for the low pressure fuel limitation power output and mileage are enhanced by these One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power and these are approved by the Dan Hepner
