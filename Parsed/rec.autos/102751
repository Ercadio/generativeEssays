From Eric Youngblood Subject Re Old Corvettes Low insurance In article A , SCOTT WARREN ROSANDER writes In article C Csux F , George Hei nz writes After too many years of school I'm finally graduating and getting a real job Of course I am trying to make plans of how to spend all this extra money Right now I have an accord, a good car, but not real sporty I was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around k on a sports car of some kind After thinking about it, I may have a better idea I'll keep the Accord until it drops and buy the car I've always wanted a Corvette Stingray My reasoning is that accord corvette is less than what I would spend anyway Basically, I'm thinking of a late 's, early 's for around k My question is, what are good years to consider for reliability, looks, horsepower in that order, believe it or not, horsepower is not a main concern, if I want to go fast, I get on my motorcycle and what are good prices Also, what would insurance look like I'm male, single, I might wait until I'm to get the car lower insurance Would the fact that I mainly drive the other car lower it Is there some type of classic car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k miles per year My dad has a vette and its on what you say 'classic insurance' Basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving time, which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would probably suit your needs for limited mileage In addition to restricted mileage, many classic insurance carriers also require that the vehicle be garaged when not in use Ericy Eric Youngblood Bell Northern Research Richardson, Texas , Peon w o Email privs
