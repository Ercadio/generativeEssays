From aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer Subject Re MR noisy engine In a previous article, eliot says In article r vofINN THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO writes Are there any MR owners or motor head gurus out there, that know why my MR 's engine sounds noisy The MR 's engine is noisy at the best of times, but not even a nice nose it's one of those very ugly noises assuming yours is a non turbo MR , the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline that doesn't have balance shafts i guess toyota didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline larger than liters and no balance shafts it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a V eliot nice theory too bad the MR 's never came with a four cylinder over liters More like Or did they were the nonturbo MR II's or some such I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented design like Porsche's I c ya DREW
