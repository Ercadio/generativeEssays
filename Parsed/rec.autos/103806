From Desmond Chan Subject Re Honda clutch chatter I also experience this kinda problem in my BMW During cold start ups the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out for about the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress the clutch the whole chassis moves But after preheating it becomes smooth I think that your suggestion of being some humudity is right but there should be some I also found out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more
