From Timothy J Gardner Subject Re The Mustang In article Brian J Queiser writes On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang I do not put much stock in the mag rags' inside information or even Ford rep The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's Inside information had the Taurus with a and rear wheel drive at one I wouldn't look for a simple re paneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself if you There's a lot of Ford hasn't released a new car without a wheel IS in The Mustang project has been brewing for at least right A wheel IS could Those modular 's are out there In the interest of CAFE and competition don't rule those out Your ignorant if you And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there who really knows what it'll look like The Mach III Doubt The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile It attracts way more attention than the Camaro Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its After the Thunderbird cost and weight debacle Ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in a volume The current V will soldier on for about two A version of the valve modular V in the Mark VIII could be offered Ford is spending big money tooling up for and V engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of hp V engines a Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro Firebird I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will achieve with the Camaro The way GM loses money the temptation to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes Tim Gardner
