From a welker Subject Aftermarket exhausts for BMW I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust for my BMW So far I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for and an Ansa exhaust for Canadian funds I was wondering if anyone could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible exhausts that I may be interested My main priorities are a decent horse power increase and a nice low note to go along with that added I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz anyone got anything to say about these I am mainly looking for the muffler only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing to go after I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the mail me back if you have any Mike Welker
