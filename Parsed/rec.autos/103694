from thomas tornblom subject re ultimate awd vehicles in article writes before the s became the s4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v. this model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon. very rare also. mike sylvester umass being a satisfied audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th audi) i
get the free vag magazine. the latest issue presented a new s4 avant
(wagon) with a 4.2 litre v8. i'd like one of these ;-) btw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and i must say that
even in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in
road holding and balance that i hope i can afford them always. thomas
