From DaveTorok Subject Re Looking for Tips for Driving Cross Country R Goldstein sez As the subject says, I am moving from Mass to Calif and will be driving mostly on Interstate Any advice from folks who have done it before Plan your gas stops in major city areas to avoid the cent per gallon only gas station for miles and you're an out of towner surcharge Prepare your car Don't forget things like your fuel air filters If you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff just in case of a flat In my x country trip, a tire disintegrated in the California desert it took me minutes to unload all my stuff to get to the tire If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as possibly avoiding theft McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms invest in a CB magnetic roof antenna It may help if you're stranded, and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc Many times police like to hang out in the st miles after you enter a new state, to catch all the speeders who have escaped the previous state Same as above when you enter a mph city zone after hours and hours of mph rural interstate Dave DaveTorok FAX JUGGLE NYNEX Science Technology, Westchester Ave, White Plains, NY
