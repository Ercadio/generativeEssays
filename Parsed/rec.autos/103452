From Shazad Barlas Subject Re service indicator of a BMW There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights will come back on after The tool is in fact illegal in Europe atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know of no other anyone else About changing oil every thats on newer Audis they only require it after every miles I am talking about an oil change Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden acceleration etc If yeah then the M oil change seems quite But if you drive kinda I'd get a bit up tight abot that thingy a point to note just because the first light came on at doesn't mean all the others will come on every too
