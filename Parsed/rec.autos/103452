From Shazad Barlas Subject Re service indicator of a BMW Derek There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights will come back on after weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used BMW and a few weeks later, all the lights come on Other than that, I know of no other tool anyone else About changing oil every , miles thats ok on newer Audis, they only require it after every , miles I am talking about an oil change Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden acceleration etc If yeah, then the , M oil change seems quite reasonable But if you drive kinda fast I'd get a bit up tight abot that , thingy a point to note just because the first light came on at k, doesn't mean all the others will come on every k too Shaz
