From Robert J Wade Subject Re Saturn Extended Warranty In article C rrw G LOGIN austin ibm com writes I've owned a Saturn for and year and a half, and didn't have the extended warranty, but just traded it in for a for reasons that I won't mention unless someone wants to know I opted for the year , mile extended with deductible It's sorta like buying health insurance You could say that you're not sick now, and haven't been sick for a while, but you can't guarantee that you won't be sick tomorrow A little money invested today is better than being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it, or having to pay a lot more tomorrow than you can today justify all you want extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for the dealer and you didn't buy yr k, you get yr k free , so what you bought is yr k and you still have to pay every time you use this great 'warranty' better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs if when you need it considering that your last car was only years old, are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's free warranty period btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around that's right, only of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future repairs that the group of extended warranty people collect
