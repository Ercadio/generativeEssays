From Gene Kim Subject REVIEW Ford Taurus SHO Review of Ford Taurus SHO By Gene Kim Background Last week I bought a Ford Taurus SHO moving up from driving a Toyota Celica ST and a Oldsmobile I have been interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every I bought a remarkably clean maroon red SHO with miles on it for As far as I can tell this is about under Blue Book and I still have another miles before the Extended Service Plan runs As one should with any pre SHOs I made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt However my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter I understand I can get this for from any Ford service In addition the car received the full tune up at miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve For a car with miles on it the car was virtually The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front air dam molding was covered with lots of small scratches not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the Having driven a smaller two door coupe for so long I was a bit concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger To my surprise the size of the car doesn't bother me at all it seems just as nimble as my Celica No comparisons with my Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarter windows aft of the back seat door windows and in front of the C pillar and rear Parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that I love the In fact I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up for a hour drive to Washington DC for the More on the ride later in this Engine As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs I was very interested in the valve Yamaha Shogun I was not Base performance of the engine under rpms is You can even do reasonable launches from second gear although I don't make a practice of The engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many This is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the More on this While the performance of the engine under rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a Jekyll Hyde transformation once you hit higher At rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open The engine soars to its rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at rpm I've noticed that when I drive around town I constantly watch the tach to see how far below rpm I To go from rpm to you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more than adequate it doesn't come fully online until those other valves are Transmission When Car and Driver first reviewed the car in they marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in and remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic the clutch was that That was back The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a Ford recall in The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the one on my Toyota In fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more When playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very The and gates were where you'd expect it to be and the shifting action was On the road it's much the same but you have to shift SLOWLY Make no mistake it's a clumsy When hurrying shifts like when I was initially trying to impress friends I consistently miss the shift often grope clumsily for the shift and sometimes even muff the I find this pretty amazing in a car like It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your Seems obvious but compared to my Toyota and my friend's Honda this seems atrocious and Someone on noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off the line because of the incredibly clumsy I now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more When you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no I don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at Along these same lines I initially had trouble shifting gears Again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped This took several days for me to get the hang I think some of my problems were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher Occasionally I have trouble shifting into The shifter refuses to enter the gate and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of A quirk When I upshift and the engine drops back to rpm I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine Not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear I asked about it when I was looking at the car as do all my Apparently this is a definitely a SHO sound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rollover Replies to my queries on are at the end of this Exterior As I mentioned before I am astounded by how well the body of this SHO has stood Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non Looking at how older Tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully I wonder what the guys at Ford did differently to the SHO The body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock For some odd reason the SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at stoplights of course this could be my overactive SHOs get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with SHO stenciled in I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in I don't think the car is I like it that I feel almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who Interior The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the The seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a black grey metallic The instrumentation is stock Taurus except for the mph speedo and rpm You get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a CD player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways I think and a compartment for holding cassette There's map holders in the doors and an oddly small glove I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a Hey I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its And it's a before the interior was upgraded The backseat is bigger than any car I've Why do they need so much space No smart ass comments The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side From what I hear it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show Mine is no The left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the A big surprise for me I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal hand parking Instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left Too Again I'm getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to Ride The suspension is nice and Too stiff It's stiffer than any car I've A friend's new Toyota Celica ST seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps The SHO seems stiffer with less ability to soak up Driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring On the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all I listened for that before I bought the On the highway the ride is When I drove the car from Chicago back to Purdue I had trouble keeping under mph let alone from trying to see what mph really feels It's a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof I've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the No easy way to get rid of it I Over the past three days I've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too Not for me mind But I wonder whether I would advise my dad to buy one for But I've discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts you'll have no reason to Let me The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and After I understood this I avoid the limits of traction and I'm a happy camper It's not body rigidity but the composure of the As if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway It tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the high effort steering didn't seem so However it's reasonable but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a Ford Probe IMHO it's much better than the steering on my Celica I wonder how bad this car is during winter Miscellaneous notes GRIPES The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days I look up wondering where all the noise Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing as it retracts on its I wonder if there is a quick fix for Again other days it completely Function of humidity Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer I've never complained about I wish the seats had more support under the Also I wish the side bolsters would close more I hear that tires for this car can get really I currently have Goodyear GT that cost the previous owner for I used to hate the Ford stereo systems whose idea was it to use a volume paddle Now to my amazement I don't really and sometimes think it's an okay idea Pretty ridiculous Getting up to rpm sometimes seems to be a But this is no big There is more than enough torque down I often goof up the shifting when driving with It took me a couple of days before I could really shift smoothly from to Hard to believe isn't it My car has almost miles on My parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a low mileage Astute observation I wonder how long I can make my SHO last I just bought a book titled Drive It Forever for tips in this The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a I once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after I started The car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal Also I began to wonder how strong that brake really Today I backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed the glowing brake The driver's power window creaks when closed all the The same thing happens in my parents Mercury Oddly all the other windows work LIKES I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each The cupholders are I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is You can lock all the doors by pressing the and buttons together Neat And you can never lock yourself out of the I really feel like I don't deserve this I really can't believe that I could afford I got this car ten years ahead of I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to look into buying I love this car so much that I wrote this file I meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with If there were a Powers Survey for used car owners I would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this I don't like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time I'm sure I'd buy another For under you can't beat Next time with an airbag and ABS Insurance wise this car is also a big I pay the same premiums as on my Toyota Celica despite that it has nearly twice the Other Odds and Ends Much to my amazement there is no SHO mailing list Maybe because the SHO Registry publication has filled this I haven't joined yet but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still appear on about once a Owners of SHOs are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the Maybe some of the most vocal on I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these I'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one but maybe someone out there Gene Kim
