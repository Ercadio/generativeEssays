From Antonio L Balsamo Save the wails Subject Re Warped brake discs on ' Taurus L From Bruce S Winters Subject Re Warped brake discs on ' Taurus L In the past few years I have owned Mustang GTs and now own a T Bird SC They all have had this problem There was a recall on the T bird for the brake problem The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp after about K miles Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on the T Bird I'll never buy a Ford again I just had my rotors on my ' Taurus GL changed less than miles ago and you guessed it, I'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem This is a brand new rotor bought from a Ford Dealership Can't they even produce a brand new rotor that is not warped I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it out for a new rotor This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed Tony Name Antonio L Balsamo Company Digital Equipment Corp Shrewsbury, Mass Work E mail
