From aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer Subject Re It's a rush was Re Too fast In a previous article, Christian Huebner says Bradford Kellogg writes I think he's talking about a different form of rush Evidently, it's fun to be terrified But hey, if you want that kind of rush, try bobsledding You may only get up to or so, but it makes in a car feel like a stroll in the park Why should a good driver be terrified at mph The only thing I fear going at are drivers, who switch to the left lane without using either rear view mirror or flashers Doing to ain't a rush for me, but it's fun and I get where I want to go much faster But in one point You are quite right If You are terrified at You should better not drive that fast, or You'll be a hazard to others BTW, before You flame me, read my E Mail address I know what I'm talking about, as I live in Germany BK Chris not a flame, just a point I'd be scared at here, not because i feel I or my car couldn't handle it, but because of exactly what you said drivers who are STUPID Like the ones who are doing also, and so they pull in right behind you at maybe car lengths oh yeah, real smart This scares me in cities at When i can't see enough of the car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE And when i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper sigh this is why America has speed limits our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their car my thoughts DREW
