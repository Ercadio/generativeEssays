From aas po CWRU Edu Andrew A Spencer Subject Re Too fast In a previous article, wrat unisql UUCP wharfie says In article qkon Jim Frost writes larger engine That's what the SHO is a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine They didn't even bother improving the brakes That shows how much you know about anything The brakes on the SHO are very different inch or I forget discs all around, vented in front The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front, drums rear one i saw had vented rears too it was on a lot of course, the sales man was a fool titanium wheels yeah, right then later told me they were magnesium more believable, but still crap, since Al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good i tend to agree, tho that this still doesn't take the SHO up to standard for running on a regular basis The brakes should be bigger, like or so take a look at the ones on the Corrados where they have braking regulations DREW
