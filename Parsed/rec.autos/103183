From Robert J Wade Subject Re Saturn Extended Warranty In article U U writes I agree with Gaia Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind this is an interesting point some people are not really buying the coverage, they are buying 'peace of mind', marketing folks love selling that i suggest that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that 'peace of mind' In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough In my case, that's be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof, windows, doors, etc I could do myself I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such you'd be surprised how much the little knick knack stuff can cost what if your a c goes out steering rack don't get me wrong i'm against all extended warranties they are a ripoff Plus I think the extra years of hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so meting I opted for the year plan for extra yrs you realize the first yr k is free warranty that comes with the car Thomas
