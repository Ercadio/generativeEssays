From I We are Gaia Subject Re Plymouth Sundance Dodge Shadow experiences In article Stephen Nicholas writes daubendr Darren R Daubenspeck writes they are pretty much junk stay away from they will be replaced next year with all new Junk They've made the C D lists for years due to their excellent handling and They have been around since about oh or so they're not the newest on the lot and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class You can get into a L v hp Shadow for the I turbo a bit more and a droptop for As an ex Fleet of cars they were amoung the most trouble free of all I bought one for my nnnnnnnng Thank you for playing I cannot agree with I believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk I loved this car I babied it I pampered it and after years it just couldn't stay together I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had but know this it's not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will NOT happen at any chrysler dodge take your pick I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers service with the intro of the LH cars I will believe it when I see Case and point the local dodge You drive up just looking you don't even get out of your door when about yes salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders Service is about times worse than I had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent and about dollars of work parts to fix Let me tell you the problems I had and I took care of this car I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldn't have Dodge Shadow ES These were replaced within the years that I owned the Engine Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar Water pumps thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer Batteries These were rebuilt repaired Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my For about a year before I sold the car I said to myself it's a good car I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix In the end before I traded it in for a Saturn the power steering started acting up I just stopped putting money into I must have put at least worth of repairs over it's I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite Bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last You can do better and I know people will disagree with me here but Japanese like Honda or Toyota or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product I will not touch another chrysler product again no I don't care how good the LH cars look good and I will admit they look promising but not with the support that you GM isn't much better thank god they don't control Saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing Don't get me wrong i will be watching my car which I do like like a hawk for the next I am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to But since someone else pointed out C D as a I will note because I used to read these magazines that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products Shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated K car and Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great No car magazine is really And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports I will use them to reinforce my argument I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadow sundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average I think the best one is just Excluding the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the LH' You can find bad stuff about the Try as I might when I researched the Saturn I could not find anything bad about There is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established I read an article which had a sub column an I think this imprinted on me more than anything Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote We are watching them very Come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons Saturn was They are still struggling because they haven't learned They have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this It's called competition gentleman women if you don't satisfy the demand of the consumer well your asbestos suit on Gaia
