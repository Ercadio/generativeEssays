date: tue, 13 apr 1993 20:23:33 gmt i recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new camry (not mine,
but it caught my interest) and a new 626. it seems to replace the
factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing. i
have seen them on quite a few cars, but i can't find anything more about
them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles. i'd like to know all i can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated. ------------------------------------------------------------------
