From Paul Blumstein Subject Re The best of times, the worst of times In article r nujINN Alex Ridgway writes Paul Blumstein writes My problem turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS carb I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time Gee, I always figured that it was the loose screws on in the rider that were most likely to cause any problems Did you check for that at the same time That is very true However, screws have been loose on this rider for quite some time, so they had been taken into account Russian Roulette is fun out of times Paul Blumstein, , DoD , ABATE, AMA, HOG, doh KD LAA, MARC, ARRL, Platypus , QRP ARPCI, NASWA, LWCA, RCMA CALA Transaction Technology, Inc , Santa Monica, CA
