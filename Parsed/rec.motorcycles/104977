From wallich Ken Wallich Subject Re Aerostitch or piece In article writes Request for opinions Which is better a one piece Aerostitch or a two piece Aerostitch Like most everyone else I ended up getting two different sizes for the top and My top is a and the bottom is a For the bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs I have large muscular thighs and no I didn't use the thighmaster to get them The jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the waist and too small in the I can't imagine finding a one piece size that would have fit correctly as even the piece has it's problems strange since my V Pilot jacket fits great all over and when I tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real Also even though it's related to convienience you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running I've gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my sidecar rig With the two piece I unzip the pants I generally leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt type band real tight stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags the pants just fit and run errands just wearing the Actually if I know I'll be running errands I just wear my V Pilot jacket but that's just As far as crash protection I'd say that both suits are probably It seems that for weather protection if anything the piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by The piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe So I'd have to vote for the two Despite the slightly odd fit I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I Wouldn't go long distance without Ken Wallich decwrl vixie amber ken Ken Wallich decwrl vixie amber ken
