From Frank Perdicaro Subject ride Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda Finally the was a Saturday without much In fact it cleared up became warm and sunny and the wind About three weeks ago I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles for a test They had sold and delivered the demo about fifteen hours before I And the demo VFR was bike locked in the showroom surrounded by other bikes and not likely to move Today was There were even more used dirt bikes used street bikes cars and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking Some sort of fat bike Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each at the same One in the classroom and one on the back Plus there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles gives away every weekend in the Hmmm it seemed like a big moto After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C cheif of sales slime and another minutes reading and signing a long disclosure libility pray to god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking We went over the the controls I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left Thats Having helped push the ST out to the lot I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road away from the bikes and He rode it like a bicycle 'It cant be that heavy' I Well I was As I sat on the ST both feet down all I could think was big Then I put one foot Heavy came to mind very With Cindy on the back was she on the back Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the By rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to Even on bike with miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and Cycles is on a section of that few folks ever About miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where splits away is a lighly travelled two lane limited access It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton Manchester by the Sea and Newbury on its way to On its way there it meets a road that winds from the sea about miles inland to On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England Perfect if slow sport touring Cindy has no difficulty with gear gear purring along in top This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Lane changes were a new A big heft is required to move this Responds well No wallowing or Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was non Top gear car passing at was nearly Smooth smooth Not sure what the sound reminds me of but it is If only the bars were not transmitting an endless The jump on to caused me to be less than impressed with the Its a down hill reversing camber twice reversing radius decreasing radius A real squeeze is needed on the front The section of we were on was tight but too The ST works ok in this section but it shows its We went by the clam shack oft featured in Spencer for Hire a place where you could really find Spencer his house was about miles down After putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to About half way through the onramp I yanked Cindy's wrist our singal for hold on tight Head check left time to find Second gear gives a good Third Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into On the way to we saw no cops and very light Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too Well now it had miles on it so it was Tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping Time to wick it up I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the And stayed When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering I looked down to find an indicated Not bad for up Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted At the get off in a mile sign I rolled off the throttle and I wanted to re adjust to the coming It was a good idea there were several manhole sized patches of sand on the exit Back to the slow and heavy Cycles is about a mile from I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a My demo opinion Put it on a Smooth comfortable hardly notices the DoD I'd buy on for about less than list just like it Too much for the bike as it Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns drugs and Edgewater Drive inhouse frank marvin Wakefield MA outhouse
