From Andrew Infante Subject Re Your opinion and what it means to me In article A David Svoboda writes In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue So if YOU bring up the subject on rec moto, admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes Dave Svoboda I'm getting tired of Concours Mmmmmmmmmm beating you up, Dave RZ Ring Ding Woops You never learn AMA DoD COG Chicago Beth Bruiser Dixon By not being able to drive for a year, it was close enough to jail And, BTW, where the hell did I ask for sympathy I asked what to do about insurance, not about my life FWIW, if everyone was honest on this group, I'd others besides me that read this have had a DWI too Andy Infante You can listen to what everybody says, but the fact remains ' BMW R that you've got to get out there and do the thing yourself DoD Joan Sutherland My opinions, dammit, have nothing to do with anyone else
