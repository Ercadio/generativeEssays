From Roger Walls Subject Re Boom Dog attack In article Dan Sorenson writes Ryan Cousineau writes mere mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it as in, just like bad concrete , and lbs of swinging beef jumped a fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me When I saw her jump the fence I went for the gas, since she was about feet ahead of me but a good forty to the side Damn cow literally chased me down and nailed me No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a severely annoyed rider were the only casualties If I had my shotgun I'd still be eating steak Nope, if lbs of cow can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more manueverable dog Just run them over One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and noticed out on the road As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire fence Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to untrangle the goat from the barbed wire As I pulled up next to him seeing him still tangled up , stopped the bike and got off the Goat had vanished into the field I guess Jolly Roger
