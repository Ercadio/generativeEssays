From britt leland Stanford EDU Britt Park Subject Power Loss under load of a Honda CB T I have a Honda CB T which for most of my purposes runs well However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load That is, on a mild upgrade mph in th or th I'm lucky if I can hold speed If I try to add throttle much past rpm, power drops drastically Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past rpm The top third half of the throttle range is dead Standing still the engine runs fine up to red line K Other phenomenology at about the point that power loss kicks in, the engine becomes a little wavery That is, at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down slightly The bike has about miles on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast My thoughts run toward clogged jets and or improper spark advance I'm hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth the hassle of any major engine work Thanks, Britt Park
