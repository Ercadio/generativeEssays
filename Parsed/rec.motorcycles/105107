From britt Britt Park Subject Power Loss under load of a Honda I have a Honda which for most of my purposes runs However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under That is on a mild upgrade mph in or I'm lucky if I can hold If I try to add throttle much past rpm power drops Put simply under load the engine won't rev past The top third half of the throttle range is Standing still the engine runs fine up to red line Other phenomenology at about the point that power loss kicks in the engine becomes a little That is at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down The bike has about miles on it and is in good tune at least until it starts to I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor My thoughts run toward clogged jets and or improper spark I'm hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth the hassle of any major engine Thanks Britt Park
