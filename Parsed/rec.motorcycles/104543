From Steve Bunis SE Southwest Chicago Subject Cobra Locks I was posting to about the best methods for securing a I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock described below Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock in the Chicago area Any other feedback from someone who has used this Thanks for any Steve In article David Basiji writes Incidentally the best lock I've found for bikes is the Cobra It's a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel The lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs You can't get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder is well I wouldn't want to cut one of these without a torch and or a vice and heavy duty cutting Steve Bunis Sun Microsystems DoD Itasca IL AMA
