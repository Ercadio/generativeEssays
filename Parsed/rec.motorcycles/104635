From Blaine Gardner Subject Re FJ Owners Tankbag Suggestions Wanted In article A Mark Marten writes I am looking for a new tank bag now, and I wondered if you, as follow FJ owners, could make some suggestions as to what has, and has not worked for you If there is already a file on this I apologize for asking and will gladly accept any flames that are blown my way With the FJ's large, flat gas tank, I'd imagine that almost anything would work Personally, I'm quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank bag Blaine Gardner Evans Sutherland
