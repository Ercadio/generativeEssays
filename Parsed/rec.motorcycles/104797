From Wayne Orwig AtlantaGA NCR COM Wayne Orwig Subject Re CB C with flames out the exhaust In Article C quw B Mike Hollyman says Hi, I have an CB Custom that I just replaced the cylinder head gasket on Now when I put it back together again, it wouldn't idle at all It was only running on cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out the exhaust on the right side The exhaust is MAC I bought new plugs today and it runs very rough and still won't idle I am quite sure the fine tune knobs on the carbs are messed up I checked the timing, it was fine, so I advanced it a little and that didn't help I assume the carbs need to be synched Can I buy a kit and do this myself If so, what kit is the best for the price Any other suggestions Thanks in advance Mike Hollyman It sounds like you got the cam timing off
