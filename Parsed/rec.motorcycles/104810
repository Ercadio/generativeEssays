From Chris Seabrook Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken passengers very occasionally on the small etc bikes I used to ride in the UK it was hard I'm now riding a and that's great even moving from my freinds I was riding This may be due in part to the fact that neither I nor my regular passengers are particularly slimline I always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes their movements My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight making any kind of maneuvering I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a I recently took a work collegue to a meeting about a hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore We have a code system for turns stop and for 'I need to shift position' Chris Seabrook Fujitsu Open Systems Solutions Inc Phone Hollis Street Emeryville CA USA Fax DoD Per saltire gules and Or a sun
