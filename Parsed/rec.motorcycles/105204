From Mike Sixsmith Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post Ed Green Pixel Cruncher writes In article Mike Sixsmith writes ed All of us that argue about gyroscopes throughly understand ed the technique of me Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way me through a corner ed all the way through a decreasing radius corner Maybe they are riding around an ever decreasing circle of lies which eventually leads to the me The official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the me front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being me that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes If that's the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to that also don't teach countersteering I have to question the quality of the Me too though unfortunately the Official Line is the one that you have to adhere to if you want to get a full The examiner's guidelines are laid down by the government and the basic rider education courses have no choice but to follow It surprises me that none of the rider groups here either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time in order to pass that the front brake must be applied before the rear that you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time instead of just when it is justified there's probably a few more too which I can't think of for the If the riding test could be rejigged a bit to include more of the real world survival skills and less of the woefully simplistic crap that it contains now then the accident figures would imho reduce still Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test
