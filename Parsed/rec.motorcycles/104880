From Speedy Mercer Subject Re BMW heated grips In article rider UUCP Joe Senner writes Mark Bergman writes To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips Are they comfortable Do they transmit a lot of vibration How do they compare to the stock grips To foam grips I don't have the grips, but have looked into getting them it's my understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european style grips now coming standard on the bikes K RS, K LT, etc it's also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by providing more bar end mass I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something hard to belive considering they do fine in the degree texas summers Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order The were aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the grip itself Wires ran outside of the bars, from the grips to a switch and finaly the battery Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them Dunno if they are still made Might check with the snowmobile racers DoD Technician Dr Speed NOT Student umop apisdn
