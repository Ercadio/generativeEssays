From Andrew Infante Subject Insurance and lotsa points Well, it looks like I'm F cked for insurance I had a DWI in and for the beemer, as a rec vehicle, it'll cost me almost bucks to insure year Now what do I do I could probably just sell the bike and return my DoD number, Andy Infante You can listen to what everybody says, but the fact remains ' BMW R that you've got to get out there and do the thing yourself DoD Joan Sutherland My opinions, dammit, have nothing to do with anyone else
