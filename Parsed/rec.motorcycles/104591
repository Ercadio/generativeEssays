From David Svoboda Subject Re Your opinion and what it means to In article Andrew Infante writes Well as a few of you so aptly put it get off the road jerk we don't wanna hear your Fuck off If you noticed it was in more than two years ago and YES I've learned and it's cost And yes I've known people friends and relatives who've been involved in drunk related accidents not them they were hit and my cousin is still No I can't take back what Yes it was But by reminding me about it all the time you're neither helping me or yourself so stuff your Hey man you brought it I agree completely driving drunk is really stupid and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about But DWI is endemic in our It is a REAL And we as motorcyclists can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident right bloody in front of me and was unable to save the life of one of the participants as I reported Also drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public against those of us who ride In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue but a genuine safety So if YOU bring up the subject on admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the consequences don't expect people to respond with warm Dave Svoboda I'm getting tired of Concours Mmmmmmmmmm beating you up RZ Ring Ding Woops You never AMA DoD COG Chicago Beth Bruiser Dixon
