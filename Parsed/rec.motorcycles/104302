From Cookson Subject DOT Tire date codes I just mailed this I noticed a long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my The cut is only about as deep as the tread block and looks like it only scratched the rubber at the base but the weird thing is it's way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in My questions are How dangerous is this should I replace the tire right away and If I should since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the tire only has about mi on it what do you think my chances of getting it replaced under warranty are To the nedod mailing list and Jack Tavares suggested I check out how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it Does anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy Thanks Dean Dean Cookson DoD AMA The MITRE Burlington Bedford KotNML KotB The road is my shepherd and I shall not stop ' Sam Eliott Road Hogs MTV ' Bianchi Limited
