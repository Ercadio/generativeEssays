from blaine gardner subject re it ain't for me in article speedy mercer writes i am confused (like that's a surprise!), someone asked me for a copy of the >faq via e-mail. as i am not the kotfaq, i was wondering what the proper >responce is? our panel of judges has deliberated the question, and the answer is: send the requester one copy, and then gang-faq yourself.
