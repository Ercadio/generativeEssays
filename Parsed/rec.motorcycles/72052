From Ivan Reid Subject Re Accident report In article Owen McArdle In article Ranck writes In article Mark Whitton writes It turns out that the trailer lights were not hooked up to the Yep basic rule Never expect or believe turn signals Around here and many other places people just don't signal at And sometimes the signals aren't Sometimes they get left The scary bit about this is the is the non availability of rear lights at Now living in the Netherlands I've learned that the only reliable indicators are those red ones which go on at both sides at once some people call them brake Once they light up expect ANYTHING to occur in front of you It's not just the Dutch though However I never realised how much I relied on this until I got caught a few times behind someone whose lights didn't work AT Once I'd sussed it out it wasn't so bad knowing it is half the battle but it's a great way to find out that you've been following someone too closely Now I try to check for lights all the time 'cos that split second can make all the difference though it shouldn't be necessary I know What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody red rear You'd see a single red light come on and think Now is he stopping but one brake lamp is not working or does he have those dumb bloody red rear indicators This being Survival you have to assume he's braking and take the appropriate actions until such time as the light goes out and on again after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody red rear Ivan Reid Paul Scherrer Institute SI You Me pass DoD
