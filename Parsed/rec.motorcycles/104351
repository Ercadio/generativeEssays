From Chris Malcolm Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post In article Jody Levine writes We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving The question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are As you point out the experiments would be But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike Contact patch having shifted to one side causing bike to fall Contact patch being accelerated to the side causing a torque which twists the bike Take an average bike rider average bike wheel and at speeds of and mph say calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce say degrees of lean in say seconds by each effect My guess is that at slow speeds is dominant and at high speeds is dominant and at all speeds contributes not far off bugger all relatively By the way a similar problem is this how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast Is there a running group where we could start counter footing arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners Chris Malcolm Department of Artificial Intelligence Edinburgh University Forrest Hill Edinburgh UK DoD
