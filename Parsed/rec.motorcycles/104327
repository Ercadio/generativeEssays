From Dave Tharp CDS Subject Re Rejetting In article Jeff Burney writes If we are only talking about stroke I think I can understand exhaust pulse affect in a stroke the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the I guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the Meaning would gases so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke Do the gases really compress that much For discussion purposes I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental Unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric At the time the intake valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and As the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake At no time does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good At the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the products of In the last years the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty At this point in time on high performance bikes substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very well Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system is much louder than the On older bikes exhaust back pressure was the dominating If free flowing air filters were substituted very little difference was noted unless a free flowing exhaust system was installed as In general an engine can be visualized as an air At any given RPM anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more Pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the Dave Tharp DoD You can't wear out davet MRA an Indian Scout ' ' Indian Chief AHRMA Or its brother the ' ' TR AMA They're built like rocks ' Velorex ' NSU Max to take the knocks BMW Compulsive It's the Harleys that My employer has no Joiner give you
