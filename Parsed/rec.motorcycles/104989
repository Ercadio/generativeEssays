From CGK Christopher G Karras Subject Re Help me adjust my tappits Matthew Sheppard writes All our local 'experts' say it's the tappits that need some adjusting so I am soon to attempt I would like any advice anyone If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve I have the same Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the adjustment process or do you calculate the shims you need and then run off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock Obviously the latter would be cheaper what do shims cost but are measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims Chris Christopher Karras Internet CGK
