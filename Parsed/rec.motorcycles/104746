From Allen Tobias Subject Re Starting trouble In article Yau Felix Chung writes I am having trouble starting keeping running my I have had problems with it since last year but it seemed to have Now it's back Problem persists regardless of choke usage pattern gasoline type brand octane and pretty much anything else I can imagine to The dealer is stumped it's still under warranty I start the It runs great for a while seconds then the engine starts to slow DECREASING the idle setting will INCREASE the engine INCREASING the choke INCREASES the engine Regardless the engine will eventually slow down and stop Once stopped it will not restart even after flooded engine drill If I let it sit minutes it starts beautifully and runs great for So I go out ride it hard for miles and bring it back ride it easy for a few miles to let it cool down and put it Next day I go thru the same drill to get it Any ideas Has anyone seen this before Another rider had similiar problems and this is the mail I sent him hope this helps resolve you problem AT Allen Tobias writes Check the vent tube to the Sometimes the tube is clogged or This prevents gas from flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by the displacement of the This is the small tube on the bottom of the tank the large tube is the You will have to remove the left side tail section to get access to this Good Luck but if it was clogged wouldn't this interfere with engine operation all the time When it runs it runs Good point did not catch this in the original The only other things which come to mind since this is a gravity feed fuel system is The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the Let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel When it is cold the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas and as the engine and surrounding area warm up the hole seals One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the Connect a tube of the correct size preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow on the output side of the fuel Remove the control hose from Make sure the tank is Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check for air With vacuum applied fuel should flow To see if there is a vent problem do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the I have heard of some fuel tanks being replaced to fix this So the things which might be defective are the control hose from carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold then there is something in the carbs screwed up but there are so many things to check I would be typing all day to list them all Here are a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs there are quite a few on each I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble If American Honda does not resolve this get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service It is a number but I don't recall it off the top of my I called just about tires for my and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received here would be your chance to tell them what you think Buy the service manual on the it is an invaluable source of information for working on your bike and I might add trouble shooting
