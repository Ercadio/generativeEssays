From Bob Pasker Subject Re A Kinder Gentler BMW Mailing List Chris Steinbroner writes sorry had to take out because my news server rejected hesh Bob Pasker wrote it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists unless of course the existing list failed to meet the readers' you presumed you needed to split out a GS by implication of your split a plain ol' bmw list wouldn't meet the GS riders' good the list actually started out as an extension of my GS FJ shootout list which is why it got that since inception however other boxer interested folks have joined and the conversation has not always been geared to gs pd st specific for the sake of not forcing the split issue how about changing the charter and renaming your list from bmw gs to just bmw would that make everybody happy when i raised the to expand or not to expand that is the question question on the list itself there were mixed the list has always been open to anyone with a non bouncing from line and there has been general agreement that only boxer related stuff is almost all of the subscribers own GS ST PD bikes although some R RT and RS owners are also on at this point my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as the list is fairly technical with how do i do this what kind of that should i get kinds of there has yet to be any non BMW bashing K bike bashing or any bmw mfg'd after is a piece of shit such posts are by consent of the governed if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the then i am not going to stand in the way of so hesh let me turn the question around have you or has anyone else not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded bob pasker
