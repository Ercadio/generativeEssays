From Rhett Barnes Subject ZX Help I need help getting my ZX to I've managed to get the front suspension to be very happy but the rear I can't do anything with it to make it feel The bike is very stable through the corners I think because I have the front just right but when the straights get bumpy the rear is It feels like it actually amplifies the And the damping doesn't seem to do anything in real life although you can tell the difference when the bike isn't I've tried cm of sag from completeley unloaded but I don't know which way to Has anyone gotten the rear of this bike comfortable And if so what kind of settings what sag did you I like to corner but I also would like my kidneys to remain This thing makes the new ZX feel
