from m burnham subject re how to act in front of traffic jerks in article robert mugele, writes absolutely, unless you are in the u.s. then the cager will pull a gun
>and blow you away. well, i would guess the probability of a bmw driver having a gun would
be lower than some other vehicles. at least, i would be more likely to say something to someone in a luxosedan, than a hopped-up pickup
truck, for example. - mark ------------------------------------------------------------------------
