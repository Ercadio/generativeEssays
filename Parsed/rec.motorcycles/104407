from wm l ranck subject re should liability insurance be required tommy marcus mcguire wrote you know, it sounds suspiciously like no fault doesn't even do what it
: was advertised as doing---getting the lawyers out of the loop. : sigh. another naive illusion down the toilet.... since most legislators are lawyers it is very difficult to get any
law passed that would cut down on lawyers' business. that is why
"no-fault" insurance laws always backfire. --
