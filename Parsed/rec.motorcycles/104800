From Charles Sundheim Subject Re Krypto cables was Re Cobra Locks To follow up I had a bad experience w a Krypto Lock Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II ' long something like that that by all standards seemed like a decent Until I used it Before I ever used it for security purposes I used it for entertainment minds out of the gutter please which is to say that I sat fiddling w it while watching TV the night I got it After three minutes of mindless fiddling of course it was mindless remember I was watching TV the entire tumbler mechanism came out on the key Not unlike that old Georgie porgie nursery This left a very empty cylinder and a very non secure read swingin' in the breeze cable Kinda makes me wonder about any flat key style One yank w a slide hammer and Viola I'm making an insurance Anyone else have a similar experience w the Kryptos not bike theft
