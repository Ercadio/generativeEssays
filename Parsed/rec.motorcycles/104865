From Blaine Gardner Subject Re Maxima Chain wax and mail order In article Cookson writes In article Charles Parr writes I bought it I tried it It is truly the miracle My chain is lubed my wheel is clean after I'd try it on the VFR but goddamn Competition Accessories hasn't mailed my order Hell it's only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty bizzare Like a clear RF face sheild and a can of Chain For what it's worth I got my can in three days from That's UPS ground from CA to UT The stuff seems to work and it doesn't attract grundge like PJ Blue I gave it the acid test a full day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the sand If there's anything wet stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day but the chain looked pretty As far as mail order goes if Chaparral has it in stock and they can tell you if it's in stock or about how long it will take to back order it if it's not I usually get it in three Competition Accessories always seems to take a week or two to Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse also takes a week or two and after trying to buy some boots from them last week I don't think they actually stock MAW was about cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech boots but on Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week so I asked MAW a completely unreasonable question Do you have them in stock The conversation went something like this I need to know if you have some boots in Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard I want to know if you have them in Well the computer doesn't show anything I'd have to call the distributer to find out if we have So do you have them or not Don't you understand what I'm saying I have to call our distributer to find out if we have them in stock or Uh So can you do it Yea call me back in an hour and ask for So an hour later Phil isn't there but Mike says he'll check and call him back in half an Half an hour later Mike isn't there either but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month weeks away Screw it the bucks isn't worth the I called Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock Ooh Alpinestars Probably not they are hard to keep in stock but I'll What size Size Let's see yes Size in blue white gray white I'll take the blacks This was about noon on Monday they arrived Thursday Once again three days via UPS I like I'm not completely down on MAW they often have lower prices but be prepared to Oh and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff Scorcher seems like a good outfit friendly fast had the tires I wanted in stock and were cheaper than Chaparral Blaine Gardner Evans Sutherland
