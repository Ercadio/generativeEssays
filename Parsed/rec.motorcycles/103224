From Andy Woodward Subject re Its still cold, but first ride of the season One thing is certain, though, its still too cold After about minutes, I had to stop and hold my muffler for a while When I got home after a few hours, I kept all my gear on for about a half hour in the house F, humidity, no wind protection, and mph do not mix well Hell This is WARM I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last month when the temperature got aboce Try living a couple of years on the dole, so you cant afford any heating You put the gear on in October, abd you take it off again in May Getting out on the bike seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere warm Its all relative Happy cold riding Who are you trying to kid its the pain that makes it all worthwhile
