From Bill Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post Mike Sixsmith writes mjs Secondly it is the adhesion of the mjs tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the mjs motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and mjs not the knowledge of physics between the rider's Are you seriously mjs suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster mjs or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise writes ed If he's not I Hey Ed you didn't give me the chance Sheesh The answer is absolutely as Ed so eloquently describes ed Put two riders on identical It's the ed one who knows what he's doing and why that will be It may ed be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is ed through trial and error but it is not very effective ed Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one ed improve on that technique I hold that this applies to any human ed endeavor Herein lies the key to this thread Kindly note the difference in the Ed and I are talking about knowing riding technique while Mike is arguing knowing the physics behind It is possible to be taught the technique of countersteering ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones and such as seen in the parallel That stuff is mainly of interest to techno motorcycle geeks like the readers of but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the I know people who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton On the other hand I know very intelligent well educated people who think that you steer a motorcycle by either leaning steering a la bicycles or a combination of and Knowledge of physics doesn't get you squat knowledge of technique does Bill
