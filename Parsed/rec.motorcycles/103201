i think i've seen this bike. is it all white, with a sea-green stripe
and just 'honda' for decals, i've seen such a bike numerous times over
by sewall hall at cu, and i thought it was a race-prepped cbr. i didn't see it over at the ec parking lot (i buzzed over there on my way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!) but it was gone. is a single sided swingarm available for the cbr? i would imagine so, kinda neccisary for quick tire changes. when i first saw it, i assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage. joel.
