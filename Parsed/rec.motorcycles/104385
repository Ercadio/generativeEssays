From Allen Tobias Subject Re Comments on a Honda Interceptor In article APR skyfox howp skyfox writes Hi I am considering the purchase of a Honda cc Interceptor for CDN about US I don't know the mileage on this bike, but from the picture in the 'RV Trader' magazine, it looks to be in good shape Can anybody enlighten me as to whether this is a good purchase Is it a good bike This will be my first bike I realize that, for a beginner, cc is considered too be a bit too much bike I have heard from friends that were once beginners that if they had to start all over again that they would have started with a bigger bike One just has to be careful and not drive outside their skill level I had considered and posted about two weeks ago the purchase of cc Yamaha Seca Turbo with km, but I am a little wary now about the prospect of having to deal with a turbo both on the road and in the shop I may still consider this bike the price dropped from to CDN , but the Honda seems to be a good bike Comments One word HEAVY It steers heavy, turns require alot of effort Hard to get access to the large V motor Weak small front forks with anti dive gizmos AT
