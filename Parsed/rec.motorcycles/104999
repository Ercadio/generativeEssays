From Steve Bunis SE Southwest Chicago Subject Black Reflector Tape A few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru The idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime visibility without turning the bike into a carnival I talked to the local BMW dealer about I was told that the only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector was it being used in a coming line of BMW clothing rainsuits He wasn't aware of anything regarding self applied Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source Thanks Steve Bunis Sun Microsystems DoD Itasca IL AMA
