Subject Re Tools Tools Tools From Chris BeHanna In article C C writes Chris BeHanna writes While we're on the subject, has anyone else noticed that the deep well in Craftsman's SAE deep well set is too small to fit a bolt or nut When I took the socket in for an exchange, EVERY one of the deep well sockets on the rack had the exact same problem Not to imply that you didn't, but since you didn't mention it did you measure the size of your test nut with callipers Were all three cross lengths no more than I've seen bolt heads, and even a few nuts, which got slightly thicker further down toward the basa sort of a trapizodial cross section That I did not do however, the sample bolt I took to the store fit rather well in the following open end wrench, box end wrench, point normal socket I take that as meaning it's a bolt head But as several people have pointed out, and as I'm noting in the tool FAQ I'm writing up in case anyone will want it, a lifetime guarantee doesn't necessiarly mean better tools Yup At a socket, I want the thing to FIT Later, Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady CB T Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX pending delivery agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs
