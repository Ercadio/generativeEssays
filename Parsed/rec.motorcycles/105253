From David Svoboda Subject Re where to put your helmet In article Ryan Cousineau writes Another good place for your helmet is your mirror I kid you not If you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars, your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable BUTT, BUTT, THEN YU W NT BE ABLE T EE THE CAR NEAK G UP BEHIND YU AND P P A WHHHEEEEELLLLEEEEE T D TCHUM AND THE CHICK DIG IT Seriously, though, putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam liner that is expected to cushion your noggin And once crushed, that foam never pops back A variation of mirror hanging thing is what I do with the bike on the sidestand hey, the centerstand is for maintenance I turn the wheel to the stop left and can hang the helmet by the chin bar on the right grip There is no crushable foam in the chin bar, and it is pretty secure on there as long as the forks are locked If I have to leave the helmet with the parked bike and the bags aren't on full , that is about the most stable place Dave Svoboda I'm getting tired of Concours Mmmmmmmmmm beating you up, Dave RZ Ring Ding Woops You never learn AMA DoD COG Chicago Beth Bruiser Dixon
