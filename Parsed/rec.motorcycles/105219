From Ivan D Reid Subject Re VFR ST Owners get hidden feature In article C r B C , Dave T Dorfman writes I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson yes he has not left the country, yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR shows that the light switch is a three position switch high beam low beam Both beams Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a position switch, but sure enough as Deam expected , when you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high and low beams go on This provides a very nice light coverage of the road This is true for the St and the VFR and I would expect for any other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch Thanks to Dean for reading the schematics, try it you'll like it Be a bit careful doing this I used to balance the switch on my GS B avec Cibie' H insert so that both beams were on I eventually fried the main ignition switch, as it wasn't designed to pass that sort of current Ivan Reid, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH GSX F, RG WD SI You Porsche Me pass DoD
