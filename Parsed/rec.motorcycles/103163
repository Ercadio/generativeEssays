>-- >andy infante | i sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis | oh, lord. this is where i came in. obcountersteer: for some reason, i've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control. for
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn right (hi, lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until i get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive. maybe
i need psychological help. obcountersteer v2.0:anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
night msf class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding? -----
