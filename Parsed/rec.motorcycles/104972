From Tony Jones Subject Yamaha Locks was Cobra Lock Has anyone any experience with the new Yamaha Cyclelok It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock but unlike a U lock it is hinged in places and opens out to a large rectangle longer length than any U lock I have seen plus it folds down to real small so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for I was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack tony Tony Jones uunet cray ant CMCS Codegeneration Group Software Division Cray Research Inc Lone Oak Drive Eagan MN
