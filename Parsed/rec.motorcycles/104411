From Chris BeHanna Subject Re What about No Fault In article Michael Bain writes Insurance companies sure seem to go for No Fault Since the majority of accidents are the cagers' fault doesn't this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a No Fault system With a cars only system it seems to make sense on the surface take the legal costs out of the But it looks like motorcyclists would get Unfortunately as has been pointed out the cost of insurance does NOT go down with No The crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers' actions and that's not Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit because the rest of us end up paying Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers and the NHTSA disproved that two years ago Later Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX needs a name agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn
