from joe senner subject re a kinder, gentler bmw mailing list bob pasker writes joe, i'm sorry you felt i was pissing on your list. no disparagement
]was intended and i would be most interested to know what i said that
]made you feel that way. you didn't, i meant 'pissing' like boxer owners 'piss' on k bike owners
and k bike owners 'piss' on boxer owners and so forth. in the end it's
nothing more than co-owner ribbing. no disparagement was received or returned intentionally, sorry 'bout the lack of :-)'s. -- joe senner bmw mailing list austin area ride mailing list
