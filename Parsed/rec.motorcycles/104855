From Chris Steinbroner Subject Re A Kinder Gentler BMW Mailing List sorry had to take out because my news server rejected hesh Bob Pasker wrote it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists unless of course the existing list failed to meet the readers' you presumed you needed to split out a GS by implication of your split a plain ol' bmw list wouldn't meet the GS riders' for the sake of not forcing the split issue how about changing the charter and renaming your list from bmw gs to just bmw would that make everybody happy i think you'd get better participation this and joe wouldn't have to burden his hesh
