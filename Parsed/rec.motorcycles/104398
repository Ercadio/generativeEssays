|> tony i'll throw in a vote for a metzler "economy" tire, the me77. good
for mid-size older bikes. rated to 130mph. wearing well and handles
my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the sr500. costs a bit more than the chengs/irc's etc, but still less than the sport
metzlers for the newer bikes. cost from chaparral is about $60 for the
front, and $70 for the rear.
