From Charlie Smith Subject Re Where's The Oil on my K Going In article C DLvo J skates gsfc nasa gov Tim Seiss writes After both oil changes, the oil level was at the top mark in the window on the lower right side of the motor, but I've been noticing that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the miles I'm always checking the window with the bike on level ground and after it has sat idle for awhile, so the oil has a chance to drain back into the pan The bike isn't leaking oil any place, and I don't see any smoke coming out of the exhaust My owner's manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the high and low marks in the oil level window is approx quart It looks like my bike has been using about quarts miles The owner's manual also gives a figure for max oil consumption of about oz mile or L km My question is whether the degree of oil consumption I'm seeing on my bike is normal Have any other K owners seen their oil level gradually and consistently go down Should I take the bike in for work I'm asking local guys also, to get as many data points as I can It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand miles I don't know why I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a bit of oil when new max maybe quart in first miles this soon quits and by the time I had , miles on them the oil consumption was about zero I've been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner it stops using any oil Charlie Smith KotdohL KotWitDoDL KSPI DoD doh AMA, MOA, RA, Buckey Beemers, BK Ohio V BMW K LT, R GS PD, R , Triumph TR Columbus, Ohio USA
