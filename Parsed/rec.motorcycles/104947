From Edward Walsh Subject Guzzi T tires plus fairing question I have a question about tires for my It is a ' The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and I do not have an owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are Front H Rear H and pressures recommended are front and Oddly the pressure for the same tire on the T is listed at psi Anyone know the reason As I know though the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I The real question I have is The old tires that are on the bike are for the front a Metzler Touring Special H and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner H H as marked on each Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes What does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike Also this will be my first motorcycle with Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities The above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current rear tire What is the best metric match The local BMW dealer thought H on the front and H on the He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order I am thinking of going with a Metzler Laser possibly Comp K on the front and on the back both in MBS variety if possible the longer lasting belting system I already use the on both the Vision and FJ for the front and like it and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a might as well as giving much better tire milage Any comments A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments I should make I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim On another I will remove the ugly but in good want it Vetter fairing and I will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for It could be fork handlebar Any suggestions Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike How about lower bars clip ons for it I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' Yes I know to be picky that period really predates this is just that this bike has such potential for that Edward Walsh Hewlett Packard Company Disk Memory Division Box Boise Idaho Vision T DoD Edward Walsh Hewlett Packard Company Disk Memory Division Box Boise Idaho Vision T DoD
