from m burnham subject re advantages of slip ons in article rigoj paul thompson, writes it sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements
>for oem exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder... i read about a supertrapp system called e.a.r that was supposed to be
quiet enough to pass some european standards. apparently it's not
