from robert william fusi subject bike advice i have an ' kawasaki kx it is in mint condition and starts on the first
kick every time. i have outgrown the bike, and am considering selling it. i
was told i should ask around $900. does that sound right or should it be
higher/lower? also, i am looking for a used zx-7. how much do i have to spend, and what
year should i look for to get a bike without paying an arm and a leg???? thanks for the help! rob fusi --
