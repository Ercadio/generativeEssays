From Peter Nesbitt Subject Thanks for the speeding ticket advice I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about fighting my Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your case in Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge about the circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called Fight Your Ticket The general theme from those who said go for it was to be I should do as much research as possible go back and review the scene transcribe what happened to tape or paper use any witnesses that may have been around have a list of questions to ask the cop and or the judge and to be positive and I am innocent until proven guilty gulp A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed as this might trip up the arresting officer he may not show up if the date is on his day off or if he feels knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness and if he says I was speeding then by damn I was Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you I'll let you know what happens after the big day Peter Nesbitt Air Traffic Controller PNESBITT Oakland Bay TRACON
