From Mike Sixsmith Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post Ed Green Pixel Cruncher writes In article Mike Sixsmith writes Ed Green Pixel Cruncher writes All of us that argue about gyroscopes throughly understand the technique of Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner The underlying physics are a different matter and need not be taught to Agreed Countersteering the technique should be taught for only with understanding of the technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance This is really the only thing we disagree Maybe we should agree to disagree I still think that telling newbies to steer left to turn to the right is unnecessarily confusing when they'll do it anyway if they just get on the bike and ride the damn I know exactly what's It's those other gits that haven't a clue Me too Understanding the physics of traction is fine but I cannot see how detailed theory like that has any place in a motorcyle training All you need to know is that maximum traction is obtained with the tyre just beginning to slide against the Then we are in violent While what you state is true it is insufficient to form a traction management Available traction increases with applied normal force ie traction available to the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces and correspondingly decreases at the Thus a technique of applying both brakes and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the front can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and available Jeez Ed when you started talking about traction management policies I thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway The official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes In practice I suspect most people do what you Saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a He has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is It also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift If you don't slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or I'm not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond In any case for maximum braking if as I suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then you'll be doing exactly as you suggest
