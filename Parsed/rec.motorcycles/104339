From Ken Snyder Subject Re GGRRRrrr Cages double parking motorcycles pisses me off Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me wonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on a bike or is ready to do serious damage key carvings etc to a cage Then I had an idea chain lube isn't just for chain's anymore It seems more reasonable to me, no permanent damage but lots of work to get off Don't ask me how I know Use it anywhere, the windshield, the door handles, in the keyhole, etc What a nasty mood I'm in It's raining again K E N Ken Snyder ms loc UN Hewlett Packard Co LSID Lake Stevens Instrument Div Soper Hill Road gte tn Everett, WA un ix
