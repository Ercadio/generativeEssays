from gerardo enrique arnaez subject which is the better bike i am looking at the honda shadow and the intruder 800 or 1400? what have you heard about these bikes? also, if i plan on doing long-time riding are these twin-v cruisers the best bikes to get, if i dont want something massive like the goldwings?
