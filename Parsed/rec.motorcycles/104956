from dave warner subject sabbatical and future flames so, i begin my week sabbatical in about minutes six wonderful weeks
of riding, and no phones or email. i won't have any way to check mail (or setup a vacation agent, no sh*t!), though i can dial in and get newsfeed, (dont ask), so if there are any outstanding cfc's or such things,please try my compuserve address: anybody wants to do some weekday rides around the ba, send me a mail
to above or post here. i'll be thinking about all of you stuck if front of your
terminals......"sheeyaahhh, and monkeys might fly out of my butt..."
ride safe,
