From Ryan Cousineau Subject Boom Dog attack My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind This time it didn't work because I didn't have Riding up the hill leading to my house I encountered a liver and white Springer Spaniel no relation to the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking Actually the dog encountered me with intent to But I digress I was riding near the unpainted centerline of the roughly foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks mph for the velocity impaired The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the I saw the dog and before you could say SIPDE he was on Boom I took the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back but my memory of this moment is I next turned around and picked the most likely looking The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut mouth and hoped I was not hurt I could feel the pain in my shin and expected a cool purple welt to form Sadly it has So I'm left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars Interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden Delayed pain may have helped me here as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can What worries me about the accident is this I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was riding around the speed I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at For that matter how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit mph by the end I eagerly await Ryan Yamaha Vision Black Pig of Inverness Live to Ride KotRB AJS C S King Rat to Work to DoD I'd be a squid if I could afford the Flame to Vancouver BC Canada Live SLMR He's Dammit Jim I'm a Doctor oh COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS HST Vancouver BC Canada Easy Access Low Rates Friendly Sysop
