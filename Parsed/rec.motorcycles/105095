From Subject extraordinary footpeg engineering Okay DoD'ers here's a goddamn mystery for ya Today I was turning a degree corner just like on any other day but there was a slight difference a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible thunk I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the My bike is a Kawasaki with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bank follower or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a banked The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about mm long which screws into a threaded hole in the Now for the The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was I'm fairly sure it was there before the There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have In fact the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments Okay all you engineering types how the f k do you explain this How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without damaging the thread in the hole Is this some sort of hi tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact to let the stud rip out then changes back to a solid I'm quite amazed at how this could have In the meantime life goes on without a left hand bank Barry Manor DoD confused accidental peg scraper
