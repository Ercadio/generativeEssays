from blaine gardner subject re back breaker, near hit in article writes why do you let such brain dead idiots drive in the us? because, unlike the uk, passing the average driving test over here
usually only requires a pulse & a single digit iq. every state controls
their own licensing requirements, so it's possible that there's a test
out there that actually requires some driving skills, but i doubt it.
