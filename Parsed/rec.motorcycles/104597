From Ed Green Pixel Cruncher Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post In article Philip Stone writes Hey Ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins left to go left Or am I confusing two threads here Three I believe I discussed countersteering a horse Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plow rein and neck Plow reining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to Neck reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to When training a plow steering horse to neck rein one technique is to cross the reins under his Thus when neck reining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse is used to from his plow reining days Are you sorry you asked yet Ed Green former Ninjaite I was drinking last night with a biker and I showed him a picture of I said DoD Go on get to know her you'll like her The Grateful Dead It seemed like the least I could
