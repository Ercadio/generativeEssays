from michael bain subject what about no fault insurance companies sure seem to go for no fault coverage since the majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a no-fault system? with a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the
legal costs out of the system. but it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed. -- michael "chuck" bain ---------------------------------------------------------------------- "semi-loud pipes save lives"
