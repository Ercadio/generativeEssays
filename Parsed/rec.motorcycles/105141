From Chris Pirih Subject Re First Bike In James Leo Belliveau writes I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle and to put it bluntly it I really would like some advice on what would be a good starter bike for I do know one thing however I need to make my first bike a good one because buying a second any time soon is out of the I am specifically interested in racing bikes CBR GSX R I know that this may sound kind of crazy considering that I've never had a bike before but I am responsible a fast learner and in Responsible and in love I believe that's a contradiction in Unless you're really brave read reckless a sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of Getting more than that really is overkill as you'll never even want to use The following bikes can be bought and repaired cheaply are easy for a novice to manage and are plenty high performance Kawasaki EX Honda VF Interceptor Suzuki GS The time of the EX at full throttle is way sooner than you're ready for it With something as small as a you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly unless it's a TZR or RGV Now I'm not saying that you're certain to kill yourself immediately with a or a GSXR Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just What I am saying is that it's a waste of money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while You'll never get the throttle more than half open anyway so why spend the extra bucks chris
