From Chris Pirih Subject Re First Bike In rec motorcycles James Leo Belliveau jbc andrew cmu edu writes I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to put it bluntly, it sucks I really would like some advice on what would be a good starter bike for me I do know one thing however, I need to make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is out of the question I am specifically interested in racing bikes, CBR F , GSX R I know that this may sound kind of crazy considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a fast learner, and in love Responsible and in love I believe that's a contradiction in terms Unless you're really brave read reckless a cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding Getting more than that really is overkill, as you'll never even want to use it The following bikes can be bought and repaired cheaply, are easy for a novice to manage, and are plenty high performance Kawasaki EX Honda VF Interceptor Suzuki GS E The mph time of the EX at full throttle is way sooner than you're ready for it With something as small as a , you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly unless it's a TZR or RGV Now, I'm not saying that you're certain to kill yourself immediately with a f or a GSXR Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine What I am saying is that it's a waste of money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping You'll never get the throttle more than half open anyway, so why spend the extra bucks chris
