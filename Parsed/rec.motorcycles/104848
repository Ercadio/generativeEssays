From Bob Pasker Subject Re A Kinder Gentler BMW Mailing List Joe Senner writes I know there's already a bmw mailing list but since it's an R bike only list and limited to the bikes as well I believe the list as chartered is geared toward GS PD ST riders emphasizing the off road bikes but there are numerous people on the list with other BMW twins as well as well as the usual contingent of most all boxer talk is the main list has about subscribers there is also a digest version which has about we run about to messges to day mostly technical with little chatter and no subscriptions can be had via e in the text of a message send the command SUBSCRIBE to for the main list and for the digest your from address will be used to determine where you will receive the it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists unless of course the existing list failed to meet the readers' bob pasker
