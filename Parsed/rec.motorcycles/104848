From Bob Pasker Subject Re A Kinder, Gentler BMW Mailing List Joe Senner writes I know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an R bike only list and limited to the R R bikes as well I believe the list as chartered is geared toward R R GS PD ST riders, emphasizing the off road bikes, but there are numerous people on the list with other BMW twins as well, as well as the usual contingent of aspirants most all boxer talk is welcome the main list has about subscribers there is also a digest version which has about we run about to messges to day, mostly technical with little chatter and no flames subscriptions can be had via e mail in the text of a message, send the command SUBSCRIBE to for the main list and for the digest version your from address will be used to determine where you will receive the mail it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists unless, of course, the existing list failed to meet the readers' needs bob pasker
