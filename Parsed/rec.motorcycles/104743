From Dave Dal Farra Subject Re Contemplating Ottawa San Francisco Ottawa trip In article lbpvs David Gibbs, writes Greetings rec motorcyclists Coming up labour day weekend this year, Worldcon World Science Fiction Convention will be held in San Francisco California I am planning to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle instead of by plane as was my initial thought I live and would be departing from Ottawa, Ontario Canada I had planned to take two weeks for this trip, giving me days travel time on either side of the weekend This looks like a distance of about miles km If your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance and not as the crow flies , this is km a day for days If you spend the entire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's at least hours on the road every day not including eating peeing sight seeing etc I was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of time enjoying the country around me i e stopping with a camera, meeting towns people, going to a few bars No sense spending weeks looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas pump I estimated I'd need at least weeks to make the trip worthwhile I am looking for input, opinions, comments, or snarky remarks on My sanity In question Suggested routes Note, getting there is important, and my schedule doesn't leave a lot of room for side trips, or circuitous routes Try and stay off the interstates Anybody who wants to join me on this trip For even part of the distance Depending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far as at least Detroit Anything that comes to mind, and that you think might be relevant Call the Whithorse Pess They're a book distributer catering to Motorcyclists They have a large number of books highlighting the best roads FOR MOTORCYCLISTS along the general route you're looking at They carry listings of bed and breakfasts all through the States which accept motorcyclists Order their free catalog and within you'll probably find books covering absolutely all you needs for this trip Their 's in the Motorcyclist and or Cycle World classifieds Thanks for any input David Gibbs Kawasaki Concours DOD O K Dave D F It's true they say that money talks When mine spoke it said 'Buy me a Drink '
