From Chris BeHanna Subject Re Maxima Chain wax and mail order In article A Blaine Gardner writes In article A Cookson writes In article A Charles Parr writes I bought it, I tried it It is, truly, the miracle spooge My chain is lubed, my wheel is clean, after km I'd try it on the VFR, but goddamn Competition Accessories hasn't mailed my order yet Hell, it's only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty bizzare stuff Like a clear RF face sheild, and a can of Chain Wax Bastards For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral That's UPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't attract grundge like PJ Blue does I gave it the acid test, a full day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the sand dunes If there's anything wet stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean I'll third the recommendation as Miracle Spooge Don't go to the dealer to get it or what happened to me might happen to you you put a deposit on a new bike Sigh, Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady CB T Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX needs a name agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs
