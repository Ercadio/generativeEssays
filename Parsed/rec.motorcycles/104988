>> >> v-max - handling? ferget it. actually, a wera racer, william lumsden, considered running a vmax in a superstock. he took it out to talladega gpr for a practice day, and
_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a sideways vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
blow by down the straight (usually wobbling). needless to say, since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 cb400f, he decided against the vmax. too bad. -----------------------------------------------------------------
