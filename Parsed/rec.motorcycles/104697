From Joe Senner Subject A Kinder Gentler BMW Mailing List I know there's already a bmw mailing list but since it's an R bike only list and limited to the bikes as well I believe I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list that it be about BMW' I don't care which BMW any and all are I will probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter and would incourage other club members to do the same especially tech to subscribe to the list send a message to the list address with the word SUBSCRIBE in caps in the subject of the having the word SUBSCRIBE in the subject is the only way to if you put the keyword in the message body your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond your From line must have a valid return address the list sw will use the address in your From line if you would like to use a return address other than what is contained in your From line do not send mail to the list send a note directly to me and I'll take care of it the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From line so that your original full name in 's is preserved but the return address is replaced with the mailing list address this allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list depending on your mail interface I use elm so that's what I wrote it for keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors to remove your name from the list send a message to the list address with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in caps in the subject of the having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject is the only way to remove your name from the if you put the keyword in the message body your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond the list is run from my home system a poor little box running a very old version of something that smells somewhat like the MTA isn't the smartest around but I've managed to hack it up enough to make a decent list additions and removals are handled automatically by scripts that intercept messages based on the subject see below and may occassionally the sw will send a response message back when you if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount of time my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts send me a message and I'll look into if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number of addresses I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up with a better good Joe Senner BMW Mailing List Austin Area Ride Mailing List
