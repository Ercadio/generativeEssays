From Frank Perdicaro Subject Hawk GT new seat review Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT It came with no instructions, but it came weeks earlier than they said it would Installation would have been very easy, but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat It never was easy to put on Once I figured that out, the new seat went on the first try The passenger backrest, though, does not fit as I thought it might The supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, hard, SAE grade , or perhaps bolt that fits There is a a soft bolt in there now just don't lean back The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider Seems comfortable enough, but then again I put about miles on the stock seat without a thought The passenger's section has about times the volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it seems much more comfortable The backrest helps a bit, but I've not has enough time to really test it The backrest also comes with a small pocket Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the taller seat If I go on the three notch ride soon Dixville, Pinkham Smugglers , I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an improvement Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns, drugs and cash today Edgewater Drive inhouse frank marvin, x Wakefield MA outhouse , x
