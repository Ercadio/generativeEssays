From Steve Smead Subject XS never needs valve adjustments I bought a Yamaha XS with K miles Over the last years, I've put K of commute miles onnit Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every K Well every K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never change If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right I know that threaded adjusters can tighten up, but I didn't think these kind could Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for K on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter What's the deal Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals
