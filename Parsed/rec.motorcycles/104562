From Charles Parr Subject Re Hell In article Norman Hamer writes Having talked to a couple people about helmets dropping I'm getting about Don't sweat it You might think about replacing it and the other DON'T RIDE WITH IT GO WITHOUT A HELMET FIRST Is there any way to tell if a helmet is damaged structurally I dropped it about feet to cement off my seat chipped the Didn't seem to screw up the actual I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's feet or higher maybe If I don't end up replacing it in the real near future would I do better to wear my totally nondamaged face DOT RATED cheapie which doesn't fit as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the Shoei RF which is a LOT more comfortable keeps the wind out better is but might have some minor damage I'd wear the full facer but then I'd be way more worried about wind blast in the face and inability to hear police sirens than the helmet being a little Also what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets I'm slightly disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched etc from not being bloody careful about it and how little impact it took to chip the paint and arguably mess it up period Looking at a really good full face with good venting wind I like the Shoei style kinda like the Norton one I saw awhile back But suspect I'm going to have to get a much more expensive helmet if I want to not replace it every time I'm not being careful where I set it Well my next helmet will be subject to it fitting well an AGV That's just because I like the My current one is a Shoei and it's getting a little old and I crashed in it once a couple of years ago no hard impact to hip took care of If price was a consideration I'd get a Kiwi I hear they are both good and Christ I don't treat my HEAD as carefully as I treated the shoei as far as tossing it down and I don't have any bruises on Be mildly mildly paranoid about the helmet but don't get carried There are people on the net like those you mentioned that do not consistently live on our Regards Charles Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing Unknown
