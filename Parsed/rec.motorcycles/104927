From Godfrey DiGiorgi Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot that is if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on hard for braking or I tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible leaving Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to Similarly I held on to the grab handles tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp I'm a lot bigger than he Reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself I absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for That's helmet jacket gloves stout pants and shoes boots as a It's not my responsibility to provide this gear but it's my responsibility to require it if they want to And I agree with an earlier poster if you've not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried many passengers before take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like Mines That's a nasty place to find yourself in Godfrey DiGiorgi DoD AMA Rule Never sell a The street finds its own Rule Always obey Rule uses for WG Ducati Cinelli Toyota Krups Nikon Sony Apple Telebit
