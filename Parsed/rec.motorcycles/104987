From Eerik J Villberg Subject Re Shaft drives and Wheelies In S Stafford Vax Winona MSUS Edu John Stafford writes On Apr GMT, said Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaft drive Yes, but the rear wheel comes off the ground, not the front See, it just HOPS into the air Figure I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad, but I doubt that they are THAT bad I've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but, my Maxim will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch Admittedly, it is easier with someone on back, maybe that's what keeps the rear tyre down John Stafford Minnesota State University Winona All standard disclaimers apply Eerik J Villberg P people for the E eating of Harris Street T tasty Ames Ia A animals
