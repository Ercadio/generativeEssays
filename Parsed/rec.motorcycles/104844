his megabuck/micromass bike. he said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel. the dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he
fled quite rapidly. then again, he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp, so i don't think i'd care to try this one on a motorcycle. >the telephone worked much better than the tire pump. that's almost unfair, i've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)
