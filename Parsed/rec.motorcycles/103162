|just becase something forms a resin does not mean that
|it's not teflon based. the ptfe in slick-50 is not teflon
|either, but it's still teflon based. "teflon" is a dupont-owned tradename for ptfe. slick-50 does
indeed use dupont teflon, though some other brands of such
stuff may use imported ptfe of another brand. "teflon", being a trade-name, should always by capitalized. (dupont disclaims any benefits of ptfe in the oil supply of internal combustion engines, btw.) dave svoboda () | "we're bad-t-the-bone!
