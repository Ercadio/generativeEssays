From neil a kirby Subject Re VFR ST Owners get hidden feature WARNING WARNING MAY CAUSE UNPLEASANTNESS In article C r B C Dave T Dorfman writes I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson yes he has not left the country, yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR shows that the light switch is a three position switch high beam low beam Both beams Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a position switch, but sure enough as Deam expected , when you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high and low beams go on This provides a very nice light coverage of the road This is true for the St and the VFR and I would expect for any other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch It's a make before break type of switch If not required, it ought to be for high low beams There might be a wee problem with this If you use both filaments at the same time, the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal Possibly enough to shorten it's life span My Honda CRX cage a cage that really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights So we used to run around with both beams on Made a mucho big difference until both low beam filaments died nearly simultaneously This was two weeks after finding out how nice it was to use both beams I replaced the lights with quartz halogen lights and that ended the problem Neil Kirby DoD AT T Bell Labs Columbus OH USA If you think I speak for AT T you might have more lawyers than sense
