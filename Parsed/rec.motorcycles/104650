From JACK ROGERS WATERS Subject Re Your opinion and what it means to In article David Svoboda writes In article Andrew Infante writes Well as a few of you so aptly put it get off the road jerk we don't wanna hear your Fuck off If you noticed it was in more than two years ago and YES I've learned and it's cost And yes I've known people friends and relatives who've been involved in drunk related accidents not them they were hit and my cousin is still No I can't take back what Yes it was But by reminding me about it all the time you're neither helping me or yourself so stuff your Hey man you brought it I agree completely driving drunk is really stupid and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about But DWI is endemic in our It is a REAL And we as motorcyclists can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident right bloody in front of me and was unable to save the life of one of the participants as I reported Also drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public against those of us who ride In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue but a genuine safety So if YOU bring up the subject on admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the consequences don't expect people to respond with warm Dave Svoboda I'm getting tired of You and the Beav should lighten up esp the Beav I agree that DUI DWI is We should have reasonable laws strict enforcement and tough But Andrew did not post looking for sympathy over the He posted asking for advice because he had an extremely high His post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in any way drunk driving and has renounced drunk driving There are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other Why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem an outcast He has paid his debt to Step off the high We have all been irresponsible in the With that said I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not severe The same may be true of DWI If that is the case then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to If we had a reasonable law about DWI DUI with a stiff penalty then fewer people would do At any rate Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the If you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates tell your 'representatives' Jack Waters II DoD I don't fear the thief in the Its the one that comes in the afternoon when I'm still asleep that I worry
