From Ed Green Pixel Cruncher Subject Re Countersteering FAQ please post In article Mike Sixsmith writes Secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise If he's not I Put two riders on identical It's the one who knows what he's doing and why that will be It may be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is through trial and error but it is not very effective Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique I hold that this applies to any human endeavor that's all it is an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction Braking It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning For most of his riding life this may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to I The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects of the And that was my original Perhaps but in the ensuing discussion you strayed far from that point to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's I find this assertion Ed Green former Ninjaite I was drinking last night with a biker and I showed him a picture of I said DoD Go on get to know her you'll like her The Grateful Dead It seemed like the least I could
