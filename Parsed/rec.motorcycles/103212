From Dave Tharp CDS Subject Re How NOT to put a motor together In article A Mark Kromer writes In article , leavitt cs Mr Bill writes put pistons in bores first then lower onto bottom end deleted Has anybody actually carried out this procedure I can visualize fewer problems with canting pistons in the cylinders with this method, but more trouble with keeping the bores suspended especially for the first two pistons and with working space to insert piston pins and clips especially for the last two pistons It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially on two strokes It's very common to do this on bikes where the cylinder mounting through studs don't prevent the cylinder from being removed with the engine in the frame I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was easier yet because it does not have through studs Base flange studs, and separate head bolts, dontchaknow You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc to keep clips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc to support the cylinder while you're inserting the pins Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK If so, what's a Gudgeon Dave Tharp DoD You can't wear out davet interceptor CDS TEK COM MRA an Indian Scout, ' K S ' Indian Chief AHRMA Or its brother the Chief ' R S ' TR B AMA They're built like rocks ' R Velorex ' NSU Max to take the knocks, BMW R Compulsive It's the Harleys that My employer has no idea Joiner give you grief
