From P Ju Subject Re Help Which bikes are short Gregory Bean writes Help I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle This is great Unfortunately, she needs at most a seat This is not great So far, the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy looking KZ I have been checking out bikes hoping for lowish seats for a few weeks A Honda Twinstar cc fit me well, a Honda Hawk cc did not, the Kawasaki HB SB SH can't remember looked like it would fit me well but the price tag was way too large I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through several months ago Did anybody keep that list Please post this list or mail me one too Patricia
