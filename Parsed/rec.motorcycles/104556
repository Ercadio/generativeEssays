From Chris BeHanna Subject Re Cobra Locks In article writes I was posting to about the best methods for securing a I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock described below Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock in the Chicago area It is available through some dealerships who in turn have to back order it from the manufacturer Each one is made to order at least if you get a nonstandard length standard is ' I believe Any other feedback from someone who has used this See below In article David Basiji writes Incidentally the best lock I've found for bikes is the Cobra It's a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel The lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs You can't get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder is well I wouldn't want to cut one of these without a torch and or a vice and heavy duty cutting I have a ' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley she doesn't get out much anymore so I don't use the lock that often anymore It is made of articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately professionals can open it rather easily Freeze a Break frozen link with your favorite method hammers work well Snip through the steel cables which I have on authority are frightfully thin with a set of For the same money you can get a Kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from to thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish and has a barrel type locking I don't know if it's adjustable but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt cutter jaws rather than shear model All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one FYI I'll be getting a Krypto cable next Later Chris BeHanna DoD H D FXWG Wide Glide Jubilee's Red Lady Baby Bike Disclaimer Now why would NEC ZX needs a name agree with any of this anyway I was raised by a pack of wild corn
