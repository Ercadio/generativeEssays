From Dave Tharp CDS Subject Re V max handling request In article A writes hello there ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha v max, pls kindly comment on its handling From Cycle World magazine who usually never says anything bad about any motorcycle The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of It is short of chassis It loves straight lines aimed in one, it is nicely stable But it is not overfond of corners Forced into one, it protests, shaking its head, chattering its front tire, grinding its footpegs, and generally making known its preference for straight pavement Bumps It doesn't like them either Its fork isn't too bad, though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking The shocks, though which work on that short travel, shaft drive swingarm, are firm to the point of harshness Dave Tharp DoD You can't wear out davet interceptor CDS TEK COM MRA an Indian Scout, ' K S ' Indian Chief AHRMA Or its brother the Chief ' R S ' TR B AMA They're built like rocks ' R Velorex ' NSU Max to take the knocks, BMW R Compulsive It's the Harleys that My employer has no idea Joiner give you grief
