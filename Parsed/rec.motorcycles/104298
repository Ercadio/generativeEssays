From Nick Pettefar Subject Re Rejetting Mark Kromer on the Thu Apr GMT wibbled In an article rtaraz bigwpi Ramin Taraz wrote Does the amount of exhaust allowed to leave the engine through the exhaust pipe make that much of a difference the amount of air fuel mixture that a cylender sucks in tries to suck in depends on the speed of the piston when it goes the pressure in the cylinder at the end of the exhaust With a poor exhaust system this pressure may be above With a pipe that scavenges well this may be substantially below This effect will vary with rpm depending on the tune of the pipe some pipes combined with large valve overlap can actually reverse the intake flow and blow mixture out of the carb when outside the pipes effective rev Now my question is which one provides more resistence as far as the engine is conserned resistance that the exhaust provides or the resistance that results from the bike trying to push itself and the rider Two completely different The state of the pipe determines how much power the motor can The load of the bike determines how much power the motor needs to V ark Pilot Payload Mechanic You're Well I for one am so very glad that I have fuel injection All those needles and orifices and venturi and It's worse than school human biology reproduction lessons sex Always made me feel a bit Nick the Simple Minded Biker DoD Concise Oxford Tube Rider M' Nick Pettefar Contractor ' ' ' ' Currently incarcerated at BNR Maidenhead The United ' BMW Kay ' ' ' ' PBWASOH UK BS
