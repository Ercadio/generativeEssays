From Graeme Harrison Subject Re Boom Dog attack Several years ago while driving a cage a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow However a dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Apparently it was following the Henceforth if a dog decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black which has a pretty loud OEM horn not as good as Fiamms but good enuff but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill Graeme Harrison DoD
