from corrado,mitchell subject re route suggestions in article , steve bunis chicago writes 5e -> i-81/i-66e. after this point the route is presently undetermined
> into pennsylvania, new york?, and back to chicago (by 6/6). suggestions if you do make it into new york state, the palisades interstate parkway is a
pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic). you
may also want to take a sidetrip along seven lakes drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
sweeping turns under old forest canopy. '\ mitch corrado _\______ bell communications research / dec \======== ____|___wreck__\_____ (908)699-4128 / ___________________ \ \/ _===============_ \/ mad vax "-===============-" -the "code" warrior-
