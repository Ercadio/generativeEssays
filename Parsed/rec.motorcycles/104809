>>squids are everybody but me and you. chris behanna is especially a squid. a squid is the guy i saw back in december on cool 40 degree morning on my way
to work. he was wearing knee-length pants, light jacket, no gloves, though he
was going considerably slower than dod nominal. a poser squid was the guy i saw yesterday on my way home. similar attire as
above sans jacket (it is april in texas ya know), but he is riding down the
freeway, left hand on his side (kinda robinhoodlike), with his body turned
slightly left. brings a whole new meaning to the term poser.
