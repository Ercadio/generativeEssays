must be How do I get a DoD number That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List KotL accept no substitue Keepers for a If you're feeling creative and your favorite number hasn't been taken already you can make a request subject to KotL Warning non numeric non base number requests are likely to earn a flame from the Not that you won't get it but you will pay for Oh and just one little tiny Ask the KotL in e You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and you'll look like a clueless newbie By now you're probably asking So who's the KotL already Well as John Sloan notes below that's about the only real secret left around here but a few un subtle hints can be First it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe though John was the original Second in keeping with the true spirit of Unix the KotL's first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal the KotL shares his name with a line oriented text Third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers Fourth there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead Newsflash A message from the KotL Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something Your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader If you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the KotL memorizes the list One more thing the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to So provide some information for the list will ya The typical DoD List entry contains number name state country e mail For example Ed Green CA PS While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership that's not strictly true these days as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or Blaine Dances With Bikers Gardner Denizens of Doom by Bruce Tanner DoD Road Rider August reprinted with Bruce's permission There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops helmets anti fog shields spine protectors aerodynamics three angle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and They argue with each other and plan rides The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via The computers range from laptops to multi million dollar computer centers the people range from college and university students to high tech industry professionals to public access electronic bulletin board Currently pronounced wreck dot motorcycles it's the file name for the group's primary on line meeting place carries about articles per month it is read by an estimated Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the Denizens of Doom usually referred to as the The DoD started when motorcyclist John Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name Denizen of A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD Keeper of the Bruce was then designated DoD retroactively and of course Nickerson the originator of the parodies was given DoD The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so John Sloan DoD became Keeper of the List issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted To date there have been almost memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada as well as Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom France Germany Norway and Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club The initial run of patches sold out The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Another AMHF fund raiser selling Denizens of Doom pins to members was started by Arnie Skurow a few months Again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the So far the Denizens have contributed over to the AMA A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage As often as possible the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver Boulder Colorado and in California's Silicon Consequently two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado and the Northern versus Southern California The Ride and Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass followed by a big barbecue The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south riders from Southern California to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the An additional plan for is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus Ohio in Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two wheeled camaraderie it's a great way for kindred spirits to get Long may they Live to Flame Flame to Live centerbar This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to These insults are known as flames issuing them is called Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the A typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like What an incredibly stupid statement you Spandex clad poseur This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your The Denizens of Doom The Saga Unfolds by John Sloan DoD Periodically the question What is DoD is This is one of those questions in the same class as Why is the sky blue If there is a God why is there so much suffering in the world and Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for A long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of and signed it The Denizen of Doom Not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD to post it for DoD not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did Flaming and other amusements He who would become the holder of DoD membership thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club and started signing his postings with his membership Perhaps readers of were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup A club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by DoD club patches organized by and even an MTV style music video produced by and distributed on VHS by Where will it end Who knows Will the DoD start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computers Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a sized UNIX system Only time will The DoD has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for To become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name Live to Flame Flame to Live The DoD daemon as seen on the

to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the DoD started as a And in the words of one Denizen it intends to remain Sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked What does DoD stand for It's not the Department of Defense is it Naturally a Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied That's classified we could tell you but then we'd have to kill And the rest is A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands Notable contributions and contributers where known include Daughters of Democracy DoD Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair DoD Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts Dumpers of Dirtbikes Note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary The archive First a bit of history this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a photo Many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp e mail access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the Not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their A few non photo files are available from the server too they include the DoD membership list the DoD Yellow Pages the general FAQ and this

provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours California time Patches What patches You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches And your reaction was probably I want or That's sick or perhaps That's sick I want Well there's some good news and some bad The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD labeled widgets The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of This isn't because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no DoD store that keeps a All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own The typical procedure is someone says I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made they'll cost with going to the AMA Anyone want one Then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre paid orders is produced and quickly consumed So if you want a DoD doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise and perpetrators Patches DoD pins DoD stickers DoD motorcycle license plate frames DoD t shirts DoD polo shirts DoD Zippo lighters DoD LtF FtL belt buckles DoD and patches DoD a second batch was done and rapidly consumed by popular demand All profits have been donated to the
