From Jonathan R Lusky Subject Re Tools Tools Tools In article A Chris BeHanna writes While we're on the subject, has anyone else noticed that the deep well in Craftsman's SAE deep well set is too small to fit a bolt or nut When I took the socket in for an exchange, EVERY one of the deep well sockets on the rack had the exact same problem Looking into the socket, it appears that Craftsman's toolmaker attempted to imitate flank drive on this piece, but did not account for the extra clearance needed inside the socket Never had any problem with mine Are you SURE the nut bolt you are trying is really a hex mm is just slightly larger and a wrench won't fit on a GM mm nut my GMC pickup has several mm nuts on it really annoying, metric threads too Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is SAE Jonathan Lusky Jeep Wrangler for sale Rx A Holley bbl Camaro RS spd
