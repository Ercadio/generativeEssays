From Sebastian C Sears Subject Re Two Beemer Questions R GS In article A Erik Asphaug x writes Hello Folks, I'm very happy with my new R GS My range is miles on gallons that's mpg Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser I was expecting something rough She's a sweet backroad honey And I can go pretty much anyplace I'd take my mountain bike As far as shaft effect, it's more a torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion Rev it sitting still when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit Maybe I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion Not to start another shaft effect discussion, but the twist you feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly wheels that the BMW R bikes maybe K's too, dunno use If you whack the throttle at stop lights, it'll really rock the bike over to the right snip snip I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it really picks up the periphery deer lurking, etc Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM Please post if you come to any conclusion on this I am thinking of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my R S, and was wondering whether I was going to have to switch lights off every time I was under , RPM ' Kawi Zephyr Erik Asphaug This is where I wanna sit and buy you a drink someday Temple of the Dog Sea Bass Sears DoD Stanley, ID ' Yamaha XS F ' BMW R S ' Toyota Runner NYC, NY
